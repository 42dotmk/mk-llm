He pays the minor characters 15000 * 4 = $60,000. The major characters each get 15000 * 3 = $45,000. So he pays the main characters 45,000 * 5 = $225,000. So in total he pays 225,000 + 60,000 = $285,000.
The answer: 285000

Mark's team scores 25 2 pointers, meaning they scored 25 * 2 = 50 points in 2 pointers. His team also scores 6 3 pointers, meaning they scored 8 * 3 = 24 points in 3 pointers. They scored 10 free throws, and free throws count as one point so they scored 10 * 1 = 10 points in free throws. All together his team scored 50 + 24 + 10 = 84 points. Mark's opponents scored double his team's number of 2 pointers, meaning they scored 50 * 2 = 100 points in 2 pointers. His opponents scored half his team's number of 3 pointers, meaning they scored 24 / 2 = 12 points in 3 pointers. They also scored half Mark's team's points in free throws, meaning they scored 10 / 2 = 5 points in free throws. All together Mark's opponents scored 100 + 12 + 5 = 117 points. The total score for the game is both team's scores added together, so it is 84 + 117 = 201 points.
The answer: 201
Reverse engineering the question: Mark's basketball team scores 25 2 pointers, 8 3 pointers and 10 free throws. Their opponents score double the 2 pointers but half the 3 pointers and free throws. What's the total number of points scored by both teams added together?

First find how many kids from Riverside High are rejected: 20% * 120 kids = 24 kids. Then find how many kids from West Side High are rejected: 70% * 90 kids = 63 kids. Then find how many kids from Mountaintop High are rejected: 50 kids / 2 = 25 kids. Then add the number of kids from each school to find the total number of kids: 120 kids + 90 kids + 50 kids = 260 kids. Then subtract all the kids who were rejected from the total number of kids to find the number who got in: 260 kids - 24 kids - 63 kids - 25 kids = 148 kids.
The answer: 148
