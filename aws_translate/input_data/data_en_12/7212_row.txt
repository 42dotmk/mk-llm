Q: Jeanette is practicing her juggling. Each week she can juggle 2 more objects than the week before. If she starts out juggling 3 objects and practices for 5 weeks, how many objects can she juggle?
A: First find the total number of additional objects she learns to juggle: 2 objects / week * 5 weeks = 10 objects. Then add the initial number of objects she could juggle to find the total: 10 objects + 3 objects = 13 objects. The answer is 13.
Question: Randy has some money in his piggy bank. He spends 2 dollars every time he goes to the store. He makes 4 trips to the store every month. If he had $104 dollars left in his piggy bank after a year, how much money, in dollars, did he have at first?
Answer: Randy spends 2 * 4 = 8 dollars every month. Randy spends 8 * 12 = 96 dollars in a year. Randy had 96 + 104 = 200 dollars in his piggy bank at first. The answer is 200.
[Question]Lard decides to share a pizza with his friend Jelly. He takes a whole, uncut pepperoni pizza and cuts it in half. He then cuts these halves in half and gives one of the slices to Jelly. Assuming the pizza started with 40 evenly spread slices of pepperoni, how many slices of it are on the slice Lard gives Jelly if 1 of them falls off the slice when Lard picks it up?
[Answer]First, we need to determine how many slices the pizza was cut into. To do this, we start by performing 1 * 2 = 2 slices after the pizza was cut in half once. Each of these slices was cut in half again, yielding 2 * 2 = 4 slices in total. Next, we divide the total amount of pepperoni slices by the number of pizza slices, as the pepperoni was spread evenly. We find there are 40 / 4 = 10 slices of pepperoni per pizza slice. Since 1 slice of pepperoni fell off Jelly's slice, this means there are 10 - 1 = 9 slices left on her slice. The answer is 9.
Q: Nancy buys 2 coffees a day. She grabs a double espresso for $3.00 every morning. In the afternoon, she grabs an iced coffee for $2.50. After 20 days, how much money has she spent on coffee?
A: She gets a double espresso for $3.00 every morning and an iced coffee for $2.50 in the afternoon so she spends 3 + 2.5 = $5.50 every day on coffee. After 20 days, she spends 20 * 5.5 = $110.00 on coffee. The answer is 110.
Question: Phil has a coin collection he likes to add to. He started with 50 state quarters his parents gave him. Over the next year he doubled this. The following year he collected 3 each month. The year after that he collected 1 every third month. The year after that he lost a quarter of them when he misplaced his collection. How many did he have left after losing some?
Answer: Phil started with 50, and doubled this amount the next year for 50 * 2 = 100 coins. Phil then collected 3 per month the following year, and since there are 12 months in a year that was 3 * 12 = 36 coins added. Phil then collected 1 every third month, and since there are 12 months that means he collected one every 12 / 3 = 4 months, for 4 coins added. Before he lost a quarter of his coins, Phil had 100 + 36 + 4 coins, or 140 coins in total. Losing a quarter of 140 coins means Phill lost 140 / 4 = 35 coins. That means Phil had 140 - 35 = 105 coins remaining. The answer is 105.
