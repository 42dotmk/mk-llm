Question: The river loses nearly two-thirds of its potential flow in the Inner Delta between SÃ©gou and Timbuktu to seepage and evaporation. All the water from the Bani River, which flows into the Delta at Mopti, does not compensate for the' losses'. The average' loss' is estimated at 31 km / year, but varies considerably between years. The river is then joined by various tributaries, but also loses more water to evaporation. The quantity of water entering Nigeria measured in Yola was estimated at 25 km / year before the 1980s and at 13.5 km / year during the 1980s.
