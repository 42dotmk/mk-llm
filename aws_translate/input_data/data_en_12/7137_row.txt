No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. They address different aspects of ships and boats. 

First question: What's the difference between a ship and a boat?

The primary differences between a ship and a boat lie in their size, function, and construction.

1. Size: Ships are generally larger than boats. A ship is defined as a large watercraft that is capable of deep-sea navigation and extensive voyages across oceans. They have a greater tonnage capacity, spacious cargo rooms, and a deeper draft. Boats, on the other hand, are smaller watercraft that are specialized for rivers, lakes, and coastal waters. They have a shallower draft, making them suitable for navigating smaller bodies of water.

2. Function: Ships are designed for long-distance travel, carrying cargo and/or passengers across vast stretches of open water. They are equipped with advanced navigation and communication systems, multiple watertight compartments, and complex propulsion systems. Boats, conversely, are used for a variety of purposes like fishing, sports, leisure, and short-distance transportation. Boats generally have less complex systems and are easier to operate.

3. Construction: Ships are constructed using high-quality materials for increased durability and resistance to harsh weather conditions. The construction of ships requires extensive planning, expertise, and well-established shipyards to develop these massive watercraft. Boats, in contrast, can be manufactured at a smaller facility and have a simpler construction that is typically less expensive than that of ships.

4. Crew: Ships have a larger crew compared to boats. Crew members on a ship have specific roles and responsibilities, such as navigation, engineering, and vessel management. Boats typically have a smaller crew and, in many cases, can be operated by a single person.

Second question: "Why is a ship is called 'she' in English?"

Referring to a ship as "she" is a historical convention in the English language, which has roots in tradition, anthropomorphism, and linguistics.

1. Tradition: Maritime tradition played a significant role in how ships were personified in the past. Ships were considered a form of protection and sustenance for sailors who spent months at sea. Sailors formed a deep attachment to their vessels, and ascribing a female gender to ships was a way to express that bond. Using "she" for the ship's pronoun is similar to how some people might refer to their cars as "she" today. This personification dates back centuries and cuts across many languages and cultures.

2. Anthropomorphism: Another reason is due to the personification of ships, where they are given human-like qualities to illustrate their nature. Ships, much like people, were believed to have personalities, and so they were given names and considered a part of the crew. Anthropomorphism was a way for people to understand and make sense of the world around them and create an emotional connection to an inanimate object.

3. Linguistics: Historically, some languages had different gender systems for nouns where objects were assigned a gender, either masculine or feminine. In Old English, gendered nouns existed, and many words associated with ships were feminine. Over time, as the English language simplified its grammatical gender, the tradition of referring to ships as female persisted.

It is important to note that in recent years, more people choose to use gender-neutral terminology when referring to objects, including ships. This change addresses concerns about gender equality and linguistic accuracy. However, the custom of calling a ship "she" still endures in some maritime communities.
