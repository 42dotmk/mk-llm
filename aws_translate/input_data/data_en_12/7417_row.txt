First, determine the size and type of hole you are dealing with. Small holes, typically those smaller than 1/2 inch in diameter, can be easily repaired with a pre-made patch. For medium-sized holes, ranging from 1/2 inch to 5 inches in diameter, you may require a special type of patch called a "California patch". Larger holes, greater than 5 inches in diameter, may need reinforcement with wood and a new piece of drywall.

Next, gather the necessary tools and materials for the repair, which may include: a drywall patch (either pre-made for small holes or cut to size for larger holes), joint compound, a putty knife, a utility knife, sandpaper, a drywall saw, measuring tape, a pencil, a small piece of wood (for large holes), a cordless drill or screwdriver, and drywall screws.

Now, follow these step-by-step instructions for repairing the hole:

1. Clean the hole: Before beginning any repair, clean the hole and surrounding area by removing any debris, paint, or wallpaper. Simply use the utility knife to trim away any jagged or rough edges to create a clean, smooth hole.

2. Apply the patch: For small holes, peel the backing off the pre-made patch and stick it directly over the hole, ensuring the patch is fully adherent to the surrounding wall. For medium and large holes, follow the next steps.

3. Cut a "California patch": If you are dealing with a medium-sized hole, measure the dimensions of the hole and cut a piece of drywall slightly larger than the hole, usually about 1-2 inches greater in width and height. Next, use your utility knife to cut a 1-inch border around the back side of the patch, leaving only the front paper layer intact. This will create a paper flap around the patch, which will be used to adhere it to the wall when installed.

4. Install the patch: Insert the "California patch" into the hole, ensuring the paper flap lays flat against the surrounding drywall. Use a putty knife to smooth the edges of the paper flap, making sure it is evenly integrated with the wall.

5. Reinforce large holes: If you are working with a large hole, cut a piece of wood slightly longer than the diameter of the hole to use as a support. Insert the wood into the hole and secure it with drywall screws drilled into the existing drywall on either side of the hole. This will create a stable surface to support your drywall patch. Cut a piece of drywall to fit the hole, and use drywall screws to affix the patch to the wood support.

6. Apply joint compound: Regardless of the size of the hole, you will need to apply joint compound over the patched area. Use a putty knife to spread a thin layer of joint compound over the patch and paper seam, feathering the compound outwards to create a smooth transition between the patch and the surrounding wall.

7. Allow to dry: Allow the joint compound to dry completely according to the manufacturer's instructions, which typically takes 24 hours or until the compound is no longer wet or tacky to the touch. 

8. Sand and finish: Once the joint compound is dry, lightly sand the area using fine-grit sandpaper to remove any imperfections and create a smooth, even surface. Be careful not to sand away the underlying paper, which can weaken the patch.

9. Prime and paint: After sanding, apply a coat of primer to the patched area, allowing it to dry before applying a matching paint color. Depending on the texture of your wall, you may need to use additional techniques such as stippling or roller application to blend the repaired area with the surrounding wall.

With patience and attention to detail, the final result should be a seamless repair that would make it difficult for anyone to tell that there was ever any damage to the wall.
