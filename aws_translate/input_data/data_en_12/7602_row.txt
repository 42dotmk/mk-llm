Q: A farmer has three trucks to carry water to his farm. Each truck uses three tanks with a capacity of 150 liters of water. How many liters of water in total can the farmer carry in his trucks?
A: 1 truck uses 3 tanks of 150 liters, so a truck can carry 3 tanks per truck * 150 liters = 450 liters per truck. The total amount of water the 3 trucks carry is 3 trucks * 450 liters per truck = 1350 liters. The answer is 1350.
Question: In preparation for his mountain climbing, Arvin wants to run a total of 20 kilometers in a week. On the first day, he ran 2 kilometers. On each subsequent day, he increased his running distance by 1 kilometer over the previous day. If he runs for 5 days a week, how many kilometers did he run on the 5th day?
Answer: On the second day, Arvin ran 2 + 1 = 3 kilometers. On the third day, he ran 3 + 1 = 4 kilometers. On the fourth day, he ran 4 + 1 = 5 kilometers. So on the fifth day, he ran 5 + 1 = 6 kilometers. The answer is 6.
[Question]Sam and Jeff had a skipping competition at recess. The competition was split into four rounds. Sam completed 1 more skip than Jeff in the first round. Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam in the second round. Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam in the third round. Jeff got tired and only completed half the number of skips as Sam in the last round. If Sam skipped 16 times in each round, what is the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff?
[Answer]In round one, Jeff completed 16 - 1 = 15. In round two, Jeff completed 16 - 3 = 13. In round three, Jeff completed 16 + 4 = 20. In round four, Jeff completed 16 / 2 = 8. Jeff completed 15 + 13 + 20 + 8 = 56 skips in total. Jeff skipped an average of 56 / 4 = 14 skips per round. The answer is 14.
Q: Timothy has $50 to spend at a souvenir shop. He sees some t-shirts that cost $8 each, key chains that sell 3 pieces for $2, and bags that cost $10 each. Timothy buys 2 t-shirts and 2 bags. How many pieces of key chains can he buy with the amount of money he has left?
A: The two t - shirts amount to $8 x 2 = $16. The two bags amount to $10 x 2 = $20. So Timothy spent $16 + $20 = $36 for the shirts and bags. He still has $50 - $36 = $14 left to spend for the key chains. With the money, he can buy $14 / $2 = 7 sets of key chains. Therefore, he can buy 7 x 3 = 21 pieces of key chains. The answer is 21.
Question: Wallace runs a beef jerky company. The company dries the jerky low and slow, so one batch of jerky takes all night to make. Each batch can make 10 bags of jerky. Wallace received a customer order for 60 bags of jerky. If he has 20 bags of jerky already made, how many days will it be before he can fulfill the customer’s order?
Answer: Wallace already has 20 bags of jerky, so he needs to make 60 - 20 = 40 bags more. He can make 10 bags per day, so he needs 40 / 10 = 4 days to fulfill the customer’s order. The answer is 4.

Recently, a lot of the customers have been ordering very mild curries and the chefs have been having to throw away some wasted ingredients.
