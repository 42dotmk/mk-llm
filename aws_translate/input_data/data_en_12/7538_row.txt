[Question]Allyn is a golfer. At the starting tee, he hit the golf ball and it traveled 180 yards straight toward the hole. On his second turn, he hit the ball again straight toward the hole and it traveled half as far as it did on his first turn, but the ball landed 20 yards beyond the hole. On his third swing, he hit the ball onto the green and it rolled into the hole. What is the distance, in yards, from the starting tee to the hole?
[Answer]On his second turn, the ball traveled 180 / 2 = 90 yards. After two turns, the ball had traveled 180 + 90 = 270 yards. Since, after the second turn, the ball was 20 yards past the hole, this means the distance from the starting tee to the hole was 270 - 20 = 250 yards. The answer is 250.
Q: There are 4 puppies and 3 dogs at a camp. Each dog eats twice as much food as a puppy, but each puppy eats three times as often as a dog. If a dog eats 4 pounds of food three times a day, what would be the total amount of food the dogs and puppies eat in a day?
A: Eating three times a day, a dog eats 3 * 4 = 12 pounds of food. Since there are 3 dogs at the camp, the total amount of food they eat is 3 * 12 = 36 pounds of food in a day. If each dog eats twice as much food as a puppy, a puppy will eat 4 / 2 = 2 pounds of food in one meal. Each puppy eats three times as often as a dog, and if a dog eats three times in a day, a puppy will eat 3 * 3 = 9 times in a day. Since a puppy eats 2 pounds of food a day, the total amount of food a puppy will eat in a day is 9 * 2 = 18 pounds of food. Four puppies in the camp eat 18 * 4 = 72 pounds of food every day. Together, the dogs and the puppies eat 72 + 36 = 108 pounds of food in a day. The answer is 108.
Question: A water tower that serves four neighborhoods around it holds 1200 barrels of water and is filled to the top each week. If one neighborhood uses 150 barrels of water in a week, the second neighborhood uses twice as many barrels of water as the first neighborhood in a week, and the third neighborhood uses one hundred more barrels of water than the second neighborhood in a week, how many barrels are left for the fourth neighborhood?
Answer: The second neighborhood uses 150 * 2 = 300 barrels of water. The third neighborhood uses 300 + 100 = 400 barrels of water. The first, second, and third neighborhoods together use 150 + 300 + 400 = 850 barrels of water. Thus, the fourth neighborhood has 1200 - 850 = 350 barrels of water left for it to use. The answer is 350.
[Question]To get to an island called "Virgo", Tom needs to travel by plane and then by boat. The plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, and the boat trip takes up to 2 hours. In how many hours is Tom able to get to the "Virgo" island?
[Answer]The plane trip is four times longer than the 2 - hour long boat trip, which means it takes 4 * 2 = 8 hours. So in total, the whole journey to "Virgo" islands lasts 8 + 2 = 10 hours. The answer is 10.
Q: The price of buying a wooden toy at the new Craftee And Best store is $20, and the cost of buying a hat is $10. If Kendra went to the shop with a $100 bill and bought two wooden toys and three hats, calculate the change she received.
A: When Kendra bought 2 toys, she paid 2 * $20 = $40. Since the price of a hat is $10, when Kendra bought 3 hats, she paid 3 * $10 = $30. The total costs for the hats and wooden toys Kendra bought is $40 + $30 = $70. From the $100 bill, Kendra received change worth $100 - $70 = $30. The answer is 30.
