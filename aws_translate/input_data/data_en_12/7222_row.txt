B). Betty loves doing interesting activities outside the most usually.

Betty had always been an outdoor enthusiast, finding joy and solace in the natural world. She was passionate about hiking, camping, and exploring all the wonders that Mother Nature had to offer. On the other hand, Samantha, her close friend, was an expert angler who had a wealth of knowledge and experience in all things related to fishing.

Seeing Betty's excitement for outdoor adventures, Samantha thought it would be a perfect opportunity to introduce her friend to the sport of fishing. Samantha knew that fishing would not only provide Betty with an enjoyable way to spend her time outdoors but also offer her a new skill that she could cultivate and develop further.

To begin with, Samantha decided to share information about the basics of fishing with Betty. She explained the various techniques used in both freshwater and saltwater fishing, elaborated on the different types of fishing rods and equipment available, along with their respective advantages and drawbacks. Betty listened intently, soaking in every bit of knowledge that her friend had to offer.

As the weekend approached, Samantha planned a trip to a nearby lake that was known for its abundance of fish. Before hitting the water, she made sure to equip Betty with the right fishing gear, including a sturdy rod, a tackle box filled with various hooks, lures, and other necessary equipment, as well as clothing suitable for spending long hours outdoors.

On the day of the fishing trip, Samantha and Betty set out early in the morning to catch the first light and make the most of their day. Once they reached the picturesque lake, Samantha helped Betty set up her fishing rod, demonstrating the appropriate techniques for tying knots, attaching the bait, and casting the line into the water.

As the sun rose, the two friends enjoyed the serene ambience, waiting patiently for the fish to bite. Betty leaned on Samantha's expertise as they engaged in conversation about various topics, learning more about diverse species of fish as well as the importance of respecting the environment and practicing sustainable fishing.

It wasn't long before Betty felt a tug on her line. With her heart racing, she followed Samantha's instructions, gently reeling in the fish to avoid breaking the line. Finally, the moment of truth arrived as Betty successfully landed her first-ever fish. Her eyes sparkled with joy, and she couldn't contain her excitement. Samantha joined in the celebration, proud of her friend's accomplishment.

Throughout the day, Betty continued to improve her fishing skills, reeling in more fish and growing increasingly confident in her abilities. As the sun began to set, the two friends decided it was time to head back. They packed their gear and began their journey home, reflecting on the fun and successful day they had shared.

In the weeks and months that followed, Betty and Samanta planned more fishing trips together, each one providing new challenges and opportunities for growth. As Betty's skills flourished, so too did their friendship. Through their shared love for outdoor activities and the bonding experience that fishing offered, Samantha and Betty formed a deep and lasting connection that would endure for years to come.

In teaching Betty the art of fishing, Samantha had not only imparted valuable knowledge and skills but had also fostered a love for the outdoors within her friend that would continue to fuel her spirit of adventure. Their story is a testament to the power of friendship and the incredible experiences that await when we dare to venture beyond the familiar and embrace the wilderness.
