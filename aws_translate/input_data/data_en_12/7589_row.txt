[Question]Maria found a store that sells handmade sweaters for $30 and a handmade scarf for $20. She wants to buy one for everyone in her family. She will buy 6 sweaters and 6 scarves. If she has saved $500, how much will be left in her savings after buying all these?
[Answer]Six sweaters amount to $30 x 6 = $180. Six scarfs amount to $20 x 6 = $120. So, Maria will pay a total of $180 + $120 = $300. Thus, she will be left with $500 - $300 = $200 in her savings. The answer is 200.
Q: A company has a tank that is already filled at a maximum capacity of 350,000 gallons of water. One day the tank starts losing 32,000 gallons/hour for 5 hours, after that time the company repaired the tank but it wasn't enough because the tank was still losing 10,000 gallons/hour. It stayed like that for 10 hours. In the second attempt, they managed to repair the tank and started filling it with 40,000 gallons/hour. After 3 hours, how many gallons are missing for the tank to be at maximum capacity again?
A: In the first 5 hours the tank losses 32000 gallons / hour x 5 hours = 160000 gallons. In the next 10 hours the tank losses 10,000 gallons / hour x 10 hours = 100000 gallons. The total amount of water loss so far is 100000 + 160000 = 260000 gallons. The total amount of water remaining in the tank is 350000 - 260000 = 90000 gallons. Once repaired, after 3 hours, the tank gains 40000 gallons / hour x 3 hours = 120000 gallons. The total amount of water in the tank after the tank is filled for 3 hours is 120000 + 90000 = 210000 gallons. The amount of water missing in the tank for it to be full is 350000 - 210000 = 140000 gallons. The answer is 140000.
Question: Mr. Grey's house was worth $100,000. He sold the house to Mr. Brown at a profit of 10%. After one year, Mr. Brown sold the house to his other friend with a 10% loss. How much was Mr. Brown's selling price?
Answer: Mr. Grey had a $100 000 x 10 / 100 = $10,000 profit. So, Mr. Grey sold the house to Mr. Brown for $100 000 + $10 000 = $110,000. Mr. Brown sold the house $110 000 x 10 / 100 = $11,000 less than its purchased price. Thus, Mr. Brown sold it for $110 000 - $11 000 = $99,000 to his friend. The answer is 99000.
[Question]Loisa wants to buy a tablet that costs $450 cash. Since she does not have enough money, the store offered her an installment plan for 12 months. She will pay $100 as a down payment and pay $40 for the first 4 months; then $35 for the next four months; then $30 for the last four months. How much will Loisa save if she will buy the tablet in cash instead of on installment?
[Answer]Loisa will pay a total of $40 x 4 = $160 for the first 4 months. She will pay a total of $35 x 4 = $140 for the next four months. And she will pay a total of $30 x 4 = $120 for the last four months. Thus, she will pay a total of $100 + $160 + $140 + $120 = $520 for 12 months including the down payment. Therefore, Loisa can save $520 - $450 = $70 if she buys the tablet in cash. The answer is 70.
Q: A baker sells pastries for $5 and works 7 days a week. On Monday he sold 2. Every day the number of sales increases by 1 compared to the previous day. On average, how many pastries does he sell on each day of the week?
A: You know from the statement that on Monday he sells 2 pastries, so on Tuesday he sells 3, Wednesday 4, Thursday 5, Friday 6, Saturday 7 and Sunday 8 pastries. So the average value is (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) pastries / 7 days. The baker sells, on average, 35 / 7 = 5 pastries / day for 1 week. The answer is 5.
