Once a fearless and promising race car driver, Robert suffered a tragic accident that left him with a constant ringing in his ears. This condition, known as tinnitus, haunted him incessantly. It had not only derailed his professional life, but it sometimes felt like an ever-present reminder of his vulnerability. To drown out the noise, he began to rely on music, playing tunes through earbuds he wore almost constantly. 

During this period of vulnerability, Robert found himself entangled with a criminal mastermind named Doc. Realizing the potential in Robert's top-notch driving skills, Doc forced him into a seemingly endless debt. Now known as Baby, Robert ferried various crews of robbers assembled by Doc on a series of heists, using his exceptional driving abilities to help them evade the law. This was Baby's only feasible means to pay off the outstanding debt. He longed for the day he would be free of Doc's clutches.

With each crew and job he provided transport for, Baby maintained a cordial, easy-going attitude, which often disarmed even the most hardened criminals. However, his luck took a turn for the worse when he met Buddy, the hot-headed leader of Doc's latest crew. Unlike the others, Buddy took an immediate dislike to Baby's reserved nature, and the haunting tinnitus-inducing music he always played. He made it a point to make Baby's life miserable while they worked together, and the tension between them was palpable, like a ticking bomb waiting to explode.

The crew's latest job required a purchase of illegal arms, and Baby was tasked with driving them to the meeting. As they embarked on their mission, Baby couldn't shake the feeling that something was off; it wasn't just Buddy's sour demeanor that plagued him, but also the risky transaction itself. He had a nagging suspicion that the crew was marching into a trap and the future of their operation dangled precariously.

Outside of his tumultuous life of crime, Baby found solace in a local diner run by Debora, a young and vibrant woman with whom he had forged a deep connection. As he drove to complete the weapons deal, he couldn't help but think of Debora's warmth that had so often pulled him through his darkest moments. Their shared dream was to hit the open road together, leaving their old lives behind and starting anew. Every time they saw each other, those hopes felt closer to becoming a reality.

But Baby couldn't just abandon his loyal roommate Joseph, a deaf-mute elderly man living in an assisted living home. The two of them shared a special bond, and Baby felt responsible for him, continuing to check in on him regularly. Now on yet another dangerous mission, Baby's thoughts drifted to both Joseph and Debora. He longed to break free from the dangerous life he was forced into and find a way to enjoy his freedom with his loved ones.

As the crew returned from the weapons deal, shaken but intact, Baby made a decision. He drove to Debora's diner, where she eagerly awaited him, her eyes lighting up upon his arrival. He then proceeded to the assisted living facility where Joseph resided, filled with anxious anticipation. The debt to Doc was nearly paid off, and it wouldn't be long before Baby could unshackle himself from the world of crime and step into the sunlight with Debora and Joseph by his side.

In that moment, the incessant ringing of tinnitus was momentarily drowned out by the hope of a better future, one Baby felt was so tantalizingly close that he could almost touch it. And as he parked the car in front of Joseph's assisted living home, with a determined gaze and a heart full of dreams, Baby knew that he would forge a path forward for them all - one filled with love, peace, and freedom.
