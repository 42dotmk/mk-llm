Here is a news article: McDonald’s has beefed up the Quarter Pounder as part of a larger effort to spice up its menu and reverse its financial slump. We wanted to see how the new, enhanced burger measures up, value-wise, to “quarter-pound” options at other fast-food joints. 
  
 McDonald’s announced this week that the Quarter Pounder is no longer a quarter pound. Actually, it was never really a quarter pound—those measurements refer to the weight of the beef before it is cooked (4 ounces of uncooked beef turns into about 2.8 ounces of cooked beef). Burgers at other chains, of course, also shrink when they’re cooked. But moving forward, McDonald’s patties will now weigh in at 4.25 ounces instead of 4, meaning it’s the biggest (false) quarter pounder of all the (false) quarter pounders offered at burger chains. 
  
 Local operators will decide whether they want to increase prices, but those who keep prices the same will offer one of the cheapest burgers, per ounce of beef, of all the major burger chains. ||||| Published on Sep 27, 2011

 FILM DESCRIPTION: 
  
 Outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American movie of the 1990s. Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet; the serious violence of American gangster movies, crime movies, and films noirs mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons, video games, and Japanese animation; and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as Citizen Kane, Rashomon, and La jetée. The Oscar-winning script by Tarantino and Roger Avary intertwines three stories, featuring Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, in the role that single-handedly reignited his career, as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the French names for American fast food products; Bruce Willis as a boxer out of a 1940s B-movie; and such other stalwarts as Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman, whose dance sequence with Travolta proved an instant classic.
