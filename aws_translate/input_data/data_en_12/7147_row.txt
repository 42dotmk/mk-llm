Colin: Hey Kellie, have you noticed how people just don't seem to connect anymore? I mean, I feel like human relations and abilities to form close bonds have really deteriorated lately.

Kellie: Yeah, Colin, I see your point. I have noticed that, too. It's hard to deny that social media hasn't played a significant role in that change.

Colin: Absolutely. You know, I remember when we used to spend time talking face to face with our friends and family. We'd laugh, share stories, and really get to know each other on a deep level. Now it's all about scrolling through endless feeds and liking posts.

Kellie: That's so true. The worst part is – it's not just about devoting less time to real-life interactions – it's also that the quality of these interactions is diminishing. We seem to have forgotten how to be present in the moment and truly listen to one another, even when we do meet up.

Colin: I have to agree with you. It feels like conversations nowadays are so superficial. We talk about the latest viral video or meme, but we don't really open up about our thoughts and feelings. It's like social media has trained us not to reveal too much of ourselves, to keep things light and breezy.

Kellie: Yes, and you know what they say, "A friend who can be silent with you in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with you in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing… not healing, not curing.. that is a friend who cares." I feel like that's what's missing in today's friendships because of the influence of social media.

Colin: I couldn't have said it better. It's really worrying that these superficial connections are replacing genuine, heartfelt friendships. People don't seem to have the patience and understanding for one another that they used to have.

Kellie: In a way, I think it's even affecting our self-esteem and sense of self-worth. If our relationships are based on likes and comments, it's no wonder we're constantly seeking validation from others. We end up measuring our value by how many friends or followers we have, rather than who we truly are and the depth of our relationships.

Colin: Not to mention how this constant bombardment of other people's highlight reels makes us feel inadequate and envious. It breeds a toxic environment of comparison and competition, instead of solidarity and support. No wonder so many of us feel isolated and lonely, even though we're more "connected" than ever before.

Kellie: I think the big question is, how do we reverse this? How do we bring back the depth and quality of human relations that we used to have? Is it even possible in this age of social media?

Colin: I believe it is. It's just a matter of being mindful of our actions and prioritizing face-to-face interactions. We could limit our time on social media, make a conscious effort to be present in the moment when we're with others, and not be afraid to cultivate vulnerability in our relationships.

Kellie: I agree. We need to remember that there's more to life than what we see on our screens. Creating real connections with people can bring so much more joy and fulfillment than any number of likes, comments, or followers ever could.

Colin: Let's lead by example! Starting today, let's make a point of putting away our phones when we're together, and really engaging with one another. And who knows? Maybe our actions will inspire others to take a step back from social media and rediscover the power of true human connection.

Kellie: I'm in! Let's make a positive change and bring back the depth and warmth of genuine human relations that seem to have been lost. It's time to put people first, not social media.
