[Question]40% of a farmer's cattle are males. The rest are females. If a female cow produces 2 gallons of milk a day, how much milk will the farmer get a day if he has 50 male cows?
[Answer]The farmer has 125 cows because 50 / .4 = 125. The farmer has 75 female cows because 125 x .6 = 75. The farmer will get 150 gallons of milk a day because 75 x 2 = 150. The answer is 150.
Q: Carl is figuring out how much he'll need to spend on gas for his upcoming road trip to the Grand Canyon. His car gets 30 miles per gallon in cities and 40 miles per gallon on the highway. The distance from his house to the Grand Canyon, one way, is 60 city miles and 200 highway miles. If gas costs $3.00 per gallon, how much will Carl need to spend?
A: First figure out how many city miles Carl will drive round trip by multiplying the one - way number of city miles by 2: 60 miles * 2 = 120 miles. Then figure out how many highway miles Carl will drive round trip by multiplying the one - way number of highway miles by 2: 200 miles * 2 = 400 miles. Now divide the round - trip number of city miles by the number of city miles per gallon Carl's car gets: 120 miles / 30 mpg = 4 gallons. Now divide the round - trip number of highway miles by the number of highway miles per gallon Carl's car gets: 400 miles / 40 mpg = 10 gallons. Now add the gallons for the highway miles and the city miles to find the total number of gallons Carl needs to buy: 10 gallons + 4 gallons = 14 gallons. Finally, multiply the number of gallons Carl needs to buy by the cost per gallon to find out how much he spends: 14 gallons * $3.00 = $42.00. The answer is 42.
Question: Amber buys 7 guppies for her pond. Several days later, she sees 3 dozen baby guppies swimming around. Two days after that, she sees 9 more baby guppies. How many guppies does she have now?
Answer: 3 dozen baby guppies make 3 x 12 = 36 baby guppies. There are a total of 36 + 9 = 45 baby guppies. Adding the adult guppies, there are 7 + 45 = 52 guppies. The answer is 52.
[Question]Tomas is hoping to run a marathon next year, which is 26.3 miles. He knows that each month he trains, he can run twice as far as the month before. If he can run 3 miles during the first month of training, how many total months before the marathon should he start training to ensure he can run far enough?
[Answer]In the first month he can run 3 miles. In the second month he can run 6 miles because 3 x 2 = 6. In the third month he can run 12 miles because 6 x 2 = 12. In fourth month he can run 24 miles because 12 x 2 = 24. In fifth month he can run 48 miles because 24 x 2 = 48. He needs to start training 5 months ahead of time because 24 < 26.3 and 48>26.3. The answer is 5.
Q: The rainy season is here, Jan collected 65 gallons of water in a barrel outside her home. She uses 7 gallons of water each to clean the two cars and uses 11 fewer gallons than the two cars to water the plants. Then, she uses half of the remaining gallons of water to wash the plates and clothes. How many gallons of water does Jan use to wash her plates and clothes?
A: She uses 7 x 2 = 14 gallons of water to clean the two cars. She uses 14 - 11 = 3 gallons of water to water the plants. The total gallons of water that she uses to clean the cars and to water the plants is 14 + 3 = 17. Jan has 65 - 17 = 48 gallons of water remaining after cleaning the cars and watering the plants. Jan uses 48 / 2 = 24 gallons of water to wash her plates and clothes. The answer is 24.
