In the debate surrounding the topic of using positive discrimination to increase diversity in universities, a compelling argument can be made in favor of implementing such policies. Positive discrimination, often referred to as affirmative action, is a set of policies and practices that aim to provide opportunities for historically disadvantaged groups in society, including racial and ethnic minorities, women, people with disabilities, and others who have been underrepresented in various sectors. This form of preferential treatment is designed to address past injustices, encourage equal representation, and foster diversity within university communities. Several points can be further elaborated to support this proposition.

1. Correcting historical imbalances: Positive discrimination serves as a means to address historical and systematic marginalization of certain communities. The legacies of oppression, prejudice, and discrimination have significantly affected the representation and access to resources for these communities over generations. Implementing affirmative action in university admission policies will provide these historically disadvantaged groups a fair chance to acquire higher education and break the cycle of underrepresentation.

2. Promoting diversity: An inclusive and diverse learning environment offers tremendous benefits for all students. It fosters understanding, appreciation, and respect for different cultures, perspectives, and experiences, which can be essential in an increasingly globalized world. Encouraging diversity through positive discrimination not only benefits underrepresented students but enriches the educational experiences of the majority as well, as exposure to a variety of thought promotes intellectual growth and cultivates empathy.

3. Enhancing social cohesion and equity: The substantial increase in diversity resulting from positive discrimination policies contributes to a more equitable and integrated society. In the long run, improving access to higher education for underrepresented groups can lead to better job opportunities, greater financial security, and social mobility, which are essential for reducing societal disparities and fostering social cohesion.

4. Ensuring fair competition in the labor market: Implementing affirmative action measures in university admissions helps create a more level playing field for all students entering the workforce. With a more diverse pool of graduates, employers gain access to a broad array of talent, experiences, and insights. Furthermore, it helps to dismantle structural barriers that have historically impeded the success of disadvantaged groups in the workplace.

5. Demonstrating commitment to social change: Through positive discrimination policies, universities can show their commitment to social justice and equality, making them more attractive to prospective students who value these principles. It is a way for institutions to invest in holistic education, accepting students not only based on their academic merits but also on their potential to contribute to social change and the university community.

Critics of positive discrimination argue that it may lead to reverse discrimination and undermine meritocracy. However, it is essential to recognize that such measures do not automatically exclude deserving candidates from the majority groups. Instead, they provide opportunities and fair representation to those who have been consistently marginalized and underrepresented throughout history. The ultimate objective of affirmative action policies is to create a more just, equitable, and diverse environment â€“ one that propels society toward greater inclusivity and prosperity for all.
