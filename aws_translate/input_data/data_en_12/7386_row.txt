Question: The price of buying a wooden toy at the new Craftee And Best store is $20, and the cost of buying a hat is $10. If Kendra went to the shop with a $100 bill and bought two wooden toys and three hats, calculate the change she received.
Answer: When Kendra bought 2 toys, she paid 2 * $20 = $40. Since the price of a hat is $10, when Kendra bought 3 hats, she paid 3 * $10 = $30. The total costs for the hats and wooden toys Kendra bought is $40 + $30 = $70. From the $100 bill, Kendra received change worth $100 - $70 = $30. The answer is 30.
[Question]Timothy has $50 to spend at a souvenir shop. He sees some t-shirts that cost $8 each, key chains that sell 3 pieces for $2, and bags that cost $10 each. Timothy buys 2 t-shirts and 2 bags. How many pieces of key chains can he buy with the amount of money he has left?
[Answer]The two t - shirts amount to $8 x 2 = $16. The two bags amount to $10 x 2 = $20. So Timothy spent $16 + $20 = $36 for the shirts and bags. He still has $50 - $36 = $14 left to spend for the key chains. With the money, he can buy $14 / $2 = 7 sets of key chains. Therefore, he can buy 7 x 3 = 21 pieces of key chains. The answer is 21.
Q: Lisa and Carly go shopping together. Lisa spends $40 on t-shirts then spends half of this amount on jeans and twice this amount on coats. Carly spends only a quarter as much as Lisa on t-shirts but spends 3 times as much on jeans and a quarter of the amount Lisa spent on coats. In dollars, how much did Lisa and Carly spend in total?
A: Lisa spends $40 on t - shirts / 2 = $20 on jeans. She also spends $40 on t - shirts * 2 = $80 on coats. So Lisa has spent a total of 40 + 20 + 80 = $140. Carly spends $40 / 4 = $10 on t - shirts. She also spends $20 per pair of jeans * 3 = $60 on jeans. She then also spends $80 Lisa’s cost for coats / 4 = $20 on coats. So Carly has spent a total of 10 + 60 + 20 = $90. Lisa and Carly have therefore spent a total of 140 + 90 = $230. The answer is 230.
Question: Apple and peach trees are planted in the orchard of the Grange Poser farm. The orchard has 30 apple trees that each give 150 kg of apples and 45 peach trees that each produce an average of 65 kg of fruit. What is the total mass of fruit harvested in this orchard?
Answer: Let’s first calculate what the apple trees produce: 30 trees * 150 kg / tree = 4500 kg. Then let's calculate what the peaches produce: 45 trees * 65 kg / tree = 2925 kg. We add these two masses: 4500 kg + 2925 kg = 7425 kg. The answer is 7425.
[Question]1,800 fish swim westward, 3,200 swim eastward, and 500 swim north. What is the number of fish left in the sea, if fishers catch 2/5 of the fish that swam eastward and 3/4 of the fish that swam westward?
[Answer]When fishers caught 3 / 4 of the fish that swam westward, their total number reduced by 3 / 4 * 1800 fish = 1350. The total number of fish that remained from the total number that swam eastward is 1800 fish - 1350 fish = 450 fish. If fishers caught 2 / 5 of the fish that swam eastward, their total number reduced by 2 / 5 * 3200 fish = 1280 fish. 3200 fish - 1280 fish = 1920 fish remained in the sea from the number that swam westward. The total number of fish in the sea after fishers caught some is 500 of the number that went north + 450 of the fish that swam westward + 1920 of the fish that swam eastward = 2870 fish. The answer is 2870.
