The source of a superhero's powers can be attributed to various factors, depending on the character and the universe they belong to. While it is true that "SUPER HEROES" is a trademark co-owned by DC Comics and Marvel Comics, both companies have adopted unique approaches to developing the source of their superheroes' powers. Here is a detailed and broad look at some of the most common sources of superhero powers:

1. Genetic mutations or enhanced DNA: Some superheroes possess powers as a result of genetic mutations or alterations to their DNA. This can be either inherited from their parents, an intentional experiment, or an accidental exposure to genetic-altering substances. The most well-known example of this source of power is Marvel's X-Men, who have a mutated X-gene that grants them various abilities.

2. Scientific accidents or experiments: Several superheroes have acquired their powers due to accidents involving scientific experimentation or advanced technology. Examples include DC Comics' The Flash, who gained his incredible speed from a lightning strike that also exposed him to chemicals, and Marvel's Spider-Man, who was bitten by a radioactive spider.

3. Alien origins: Some superheroes have powers because they belong to a different species or come from another planet. Extraterrestrial beings, such as Superman from DC Comics and Thor from Marvel Comics, have unique attributes that make them superior to humans, granting them incredible power. For example, Superman's Kryptonian heritage gives him super strength, heat vision, and the ability to fly when under Earth's yellow sun.

4. Mystical or magical powers: Magic and other supernatural forces are also a common source of superhero powers. Characters like DC Comics' Doctor Fate and Marvel's Doctor Strange are sorcerers who draw on the power of mystical energies and artifacts to manifest their abilities. Magic-based superheroes often have a variety of powers, such as energy manipulation, teleportation, and the ability to control time and space. 

5. Advanced technology: Some superheroes rely on advanced technology to enhance their physical abilities and grant them power. For example, Iron Man from Marvel Comics utilizes his genius intellect to create intricate and technologically sophisticated suits of armor, which afford him abilities like flight, enhanced strength, and a variety of deadly weapons. Similarly, DC Comics' Cyborg is a hero who has integrated advanced technology within his human body, granting him various cybernetic abilities.

6. Natural or intense training: In some cases, the superhero does not have any inherent powers but has trained their body and mind to reach peak physical condition. This may include intense martial arts training, weaponry expertise, or tactical knowledge. Heroes like DC Comics' Batman and Marvel's Black Widow use their physical prowess, strategic thinking, and mastery of numerous weapons to fight crime and protect others.

7. Cosmic powers or divine gifts: Certain characters may possess their powers due to being bestowed a gift from cosmic or divine entities. These heroes may serve as agents for higher powers or work to protect and maintain balance in the universe. Two renowned examples of this category are Marvel's Silver Surfer, who is empowered by the cosmic entity Galactus, and DC Comics' Wonder Woman, who is granted powers and abilities from the gods of Greek mythology.

These are just some of the many sources that contribute to the powers of superheroes in different comic book universes. The origins of their powers can be as diverse and creative as the characters themselves, offering unique opportunities for storytelling and character development.
