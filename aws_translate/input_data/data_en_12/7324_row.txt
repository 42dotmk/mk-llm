Q: Carson is a night security guard. He's supposed to patrol the outside of a warehouse that's 600 feet long and 400 feet wide. If Carson is supposed to circle the warehouse 10 times, but gets tired and skips 2 times, how far does he walk in one night?
A: First find the total distance Carson walks along the warehouse's long sides: 600 feet / side * 2 sides = 1200 feet. Then find the total distance Carson walks along the warehouse's short sides: 400 feet / side * 2 sides = 800 feet. Add those two amounts to find the total distance walk in one circle: 1200 feet + 800 feet = 2000 feet. Then find the number of circles Carson actually walks: 10 circles - 2 circles = 8 circles. Then multiply the distance of one circle by the number of circles Carson makes: 2000 feet / circle * 8 circles = 16000 feet. The answer is 16000.
Question: A charcoal grill burns fifteen coals to ash every twenty minutes of grilling. The grill ran for long enough to burn three bags of coals. Each bag of coal contains 60 coals. How long did the grill run?
Answer: The grill burned 3 * 60 = 180 coals. It takes 20 minutes to burn 15 coals, so the grill ran for 180 / 15 * 20 = 240 minutes. The answer is 240.
[Question]Francie saves up her allowance for several weeks. She receives an allowance of $5 a week for 8 weeks. Then her dad raises her allowance, and she receives $6 a week for 6 weeks. Francie uses half of the money to buy new clothes. With the remaining money, she buys a video game that costs $35. How much money does Francie have remaining after buying the video game?
[Answer]When her allowance is $5 a week, Francie gets a total of $5 * 8 = $40. When her allowance is $6 a week, Francie gets a total of $6 * 6 = $36. The total amount of money Francie gets is $40 + $36 = $76. After purchasing new clothes, she has $76 / 2 = $38 remaining. After buying the video game, Francie has $38 - $35 = $3 remaining. The answer is 3.
Q: Chris is trying to sell his car for $5200 and has gotten two price offers. One buyer offered to pay the full price if Chris would pay for the car maintenance inspection, which cost a tenth of Chris’s asking price. The other buyer agreed to pay the price if Chris replaced the headlights for $80 and the tires for three times as much. What is the difference between the amounts Chris will earn from the two offers?
A: Chris would earn 5200 - 5200 / 10 = 5200 - 520 = $4680 from the first buyer. He would earn 5200 - 80 - 80 * 3 = 5200 - 80 * 4 = 5200 - 320 = $4880 from the second buyer. The difference between Chris’s earnings would be 4880 - 4680 = $200. The answer is 200.
Question: Andrea buys herself a pony for her 30th birthday. She pays $500/month to rent a pasture for it, $10 a day for food, and $60/lesson for two lessons a week. How much does she spend on her pony in a year?
Answer: First find the annual cost of food: $10 / day * 365 days = $3650. Then find how much she spends a week on lessons: $60 / lesson * 2 lessons = $120. Then multiply that weekly cost by the number of weeks per year to find the annual cost: $120 / week * 52 weeks / year = $6240. Then find the annual cost of the pasture: $500 / month * 12 months / year = $6000. Then add all the costs to find the total cost: $6000 + $6240 + $3650 = $15890. The answer is 15890.
