The frequently proposed suggestion for establishing a children's unit within the Commission is one that I find to require clarification, particularly in order to ensure the full utilization of all currently available human resources and financial resources.

In this proposal, the idea is to create a specific unit within the Commission that would focus on the well-being, rights, and needs of children. The main objective of this initiative would be to ensure that the European Union policies and legislation take into account the best interests of children, and to create a framework that promotes the overall well-being of children at the regional, national, and international levels.

There are several reasons why such a proposal may require further clarification:

1. Existing structures and resources: It is important to evaluate the current resources and structures within the Commission that already deal with children's issues, whether directly or indirectly. This includes assessing human resources, budgetary allocations, and ongoing programs and initiatives that promote children's well-being. By identifying these existing resources, one can determine if the establishment of a separate unit would add value to the current system or simply duplicate ongoing efforts.

2. Cooperation between different departments: Establishing a children's unit within the Commission may require fostering collaboration between multiple departments and agencies, as children's issues often cut across different policy areas, such as education, health, social services, and justice. It may be necessary to clarify the responsibilities and roles of each department in this collaboration and devise a strategy for effective coordination and communication in order to optimize the use of available resources.

3. Budget allocation and cost-effectiveness: Before setting up a new unit, it is essential to assess the potential costs associated with this initiative and determine the most cost-effective way to achieve its objectives. The assessment should include the potential allocation of financial resources to the children's unit and the possible redirection of existing funds from other programs if necessary. This information is crucial in ensuring the sustainability and efficiency of the unit.

4. Identifying objectives and goals: In order to establish a comprehensive and effective children's unit within the Commission, it is crucial to set clear objectives and goals that will guide its work. These objectives should be based on a thorough assessment of the needs and challenges faced by children, as well as an analysis of the current gaps in policies and programs that address these issues. By identifying these objectives and goals, the unit can ensure that its work is focused and purposeful.

5. Monitoring and evaluation: To determine the success of the proposed children's unit, it is important to put in place mechanisms for regular monitoring and evaluation of its work. This should include the setting of benchmark indicators and the periodic assessment of progress towards achieving the unit's objectives and goals. The results of these evaluations can help inform further actions and adjustments needed to ensure the effectiveness of the unit and improve its performance.

In conclusion, the idea of establishing a children's unit within the Commission holds significant potential for enhancing the EU's focus on children's well-being and rights. However, to fully utilize the available resources and ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of this initiative, it is crucial to address the abovementioned points and provide a clear and comprehensive framework for the unit's operation.
