Many people, especially in developing countries, treat and disinfect their water before storing it to ensure its safety for drinking and other household purposes. Solar water disinfection (SODIS) is one such method widely accepted and recommended by organizations such as the World Health Organization. This method, as mentioned, involves the use of plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles that are filled with water and then exposed to sunlight for varying lengths of time, depending on the weather and climatic conditions. The treatment period ranges from a minimum of six hours up to two days during fully overcast conditions.

The process of solar water disinfection works by leveraging the natural germicidal properties of sunlight. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation helps inactivate a wide range of microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, in the water. Moreover, when combined with an increase in water temperature (thermal inactivation), this treatment method becomes even more effective in eradicating harmful pathogens. The utilization of PET bottles further ensures that the water stored remains uncontaminated. These bottles, when adequately cleaned and sealed, prevent the entry of dust, pollutants, and insects, thus maintaining the quality of the treated water.

This method of water treatment has been widely adopted by over two million individuals, particularly in rural and remote areas where access to clean drinking water is limited or nonexistent. Due to its simplicity, low cost, and ease of implementation, SODIS serves as an efficient and practical solution for addressing the urgent need for safe drinking water in these communities. In addition to being readily available, sunlight is a free and renewable resource that makes the SODIS method sustainable and environmentally friendly.

There are a few essential factors that must be taken into consideration while using this method to achieve the best possible results:

1. The water source: The water to be treated needs to have low levels of turbidity or cloudiness, preferably below 30 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU). If the water is too cloudy or includes large particles, it should be filtered or allowed to settle before filling the PET bottles.

2. Bottle preparation: The plastic PET bottles should be thoroughly cleaned and rinsed before use. Additionally, any labels or other obstructions should be removed, allowing for maximum exposure to sunlight.

3. Exposure duration: The time needed for sufficient disinfection depends on the weather conditions, intensity of sunlight, and the water's turbidity levels. In bright and sunny conditions, the treatment can be achieved in as little as six hours. However, during periods of cloudiness or low sunlight, the exposure time may extend up to two days.

4. Storage: Once treated, the water in the PET bottles should be stored in a clean and covered environment to maintain its quality and keep it safe for drinking. Ideally, bottles should be consumed within several days to reduce the risk of recontamination.

It's important to note that while the SODIS method is effective in inactivating a significant number of pathogens, it might not be as efficient against certain resistant microorganisms, such as Cryptosporidium or some viruses. In such cases, additional treatment methods, like boiling or adding chlorine, may be necessary to ensure complete water safety. Nevertheless, solar water disinfection serves as a practical and cost-effective option for individuals and communities in developing countries, providing them with access to clean and safe drinking water, which is vital for their overall health and well-being.
