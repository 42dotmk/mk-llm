Summarize the following:
If you're looking to date around, an online dating site is a safer bet than regular social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter.  Here are a few you can consider:  Free sites: PlentyofFish, OkCupid Tastebuds.fm (based on taste in music), PassionsNetwork, DateHookup, Mamba (Russian-based). Paid sites: Match.com, eHarmony, True.com, Lavalife, Lovestruck (UK, Hong Kong and Singapore), Zoosk, Meetic. If finding a partner who shares your religion is important to you, consider:  Christians: ChristianMingle, ChristianCafe, RainbowChristians (LGBT) Catholics:  CatholicMatch Jews: JDate, SawYouAtSinai Mormons: LDSSingles, MormonDating, LDSplanet Muslims: Muslima, ShaadiConnections Buddhists: BuddhistConnect Seventh-day Adventists: Adventist Singles Connection Pagans: AonghusOg Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains and others: ShaadiConnections. Atheists: FreeThinkerMatch  This is probably the most important step in the whole process.  Your profile is your first impression in the online dating world, and it can make or break whether potential partners are interested in you.  Consider these areas:  Your username.  Consider basing it in your initials, favorite number, or favorite hobby.  Avoid using words like "hot," "sexy," "daddy," or any sexualized descriptor in your username — most women will read it as creepy. Choose a good profile picture. Your profile picture should follow three rules: it should be recent, provide a good look at your face, and make you seem approachable.  If you don't currently have a photo that fits this description, take a new one!  Bring along a camera next time you go to a social event, and ask a friend to take a quick snap of you. Avoid professional headshots.  They're too stilted for an online dating site, and you'll look like you're trying too hard.  Your bio.  Most websites will provide a short bio or "about me" section for you to fill in.  Don't write a novel, but do provide enough information that potential partners will feel like they're gaining a sense of who you are.  You can discuss your hobbies, your goals, what you look for in a relationship, any children you have, or whatever else defines you as a person. Resist the urge to vent about your previous relationship.  "Recently divorced from a lying, cheating harlot" reads as "bitter and angry" instead of "dateable and balanced."  Your interests.  Some sites will have a separate area for you to list interests or hobbies.  Sports, musical genres or groups, crafts, historical periods, movie genres, types of food, travel destinations, and books are all appropriate topics for this part of your profile. Who you're interested in meeting.  Try not to be too restrictive on these parameters.  You never know — your soulmate might only be a year or two older than the top age you specify.  Keep your ranges broad, and remember that you're not obligated to date everyone who contacts you. If you're asked to describe in writing the type of girl you'd like to meet, this is the place to knock it out of the park.  Don't say "I just want someone to talk to" — no girl wants to be "just someone to talk to" when another man will call her a princess or the light of his life.  Talk up your future partner in the best terms you can muster.  For instance, you might try something like "I'm looking for the woman of my dreams, who will share my passion for cooking, cycling and honesty, and who will allow me to treat her like the queen she is."  Your contact settings.  Some sites allow you to pick and choose who can see your profile or contact you.  If you want to get a lot of responses, make sure it's easy for people to message or email you.
