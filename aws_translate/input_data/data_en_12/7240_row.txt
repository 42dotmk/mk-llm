Title: A Closer Look at Field Goals Under 30 Yards in Football History

Introduction

Field goals are an essential part of American football, offering teams an opportunity to score points when they are unable to reach the endzone for a touchdown. In professional football, field goal attempts can range from as little as 18 yards to as long as 64 yards. However, the true test of accuracy for kickers arguably comes from field goals under 30 yards, where the margin for error is slim. In this article, we will take a closer look at how many field goals of under 30 yards were made in professional football history, focusing on the National Football League (NFL) and its impressive record of successful short-field goals.

Historical Overview

Since the NFL's inception in 1920, the game has evolved significantly. The changes include the introduction of hash marks and narrowing the goalposts over time. The progression of football tactics and strategies have also led to the development of specialized kicking positions like the field goal kicker and punter. While it's difficult to pinpoint the exact number of field goals made under 30 yards throughout the NFL's history, we can gain a better understanding of this phenomenon by examining relevant records and statistics related to short-yardage field goal attempts.

Notable Records and Statistics

Records of successful field goals under 30 yards can be challenging to come by for the early years of the NFL, as detailed statistics were not meticulously documented until the 1960s. However, using available data, we can make an informed estimate of the number of successful short-yardage field goals since then. Below are some notable records and statistics related to field goals under 30 yards in the NFL.

In more recent years, this number has declined to around 150 to 200 short field goals per season, likely due to aggressive offensive playcalling and increased accuracy on longer attempts.
