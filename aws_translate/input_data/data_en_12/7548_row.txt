(b). Mary pushed them far.

There was only so much Angela could endure from Mary before Mary pushed them far. Too far, in fact. Ever since they had become friends, Angela had been slightly aware of the competitive edge that Mary had grown up with, always wanting to be the best in everything she did. An only child of wealthy parents who had built their lives around success, Mary had seemingly inherited that insatiable drive to strive for more. Angela, on the other hand, was raised in a humble environment where love and contentment took precedence over accomplishment and material wealth.

As the years passed by, it seemed as if Mary's desire to outdo Angela had intensified. From academics to sports, hobbies to social circles – every aspect of their lives felt like a contest to Mary, whereas for Angela, their togetherness was the true meaning of friendship. Friendship, as Angela saw it, was about supporting one another and cherishing each other's company, never a reason for rivalry.

That summer, when both of them graduated high school, Mary decided to take things a step further. She convinced Angela to embark on a road trip with her, claiming it would be an opportunity for them to bond. Little did Angela know, Mary had been planning this as an opportunity to prove herself as the superior friend, willing to go to any length.

They traveled across the states, visiting renowned landmarks and scenic locations, clicking photographs and creating memories. At each destination, Mary turned everything into a competition, often belittling Angela's efforts so she could emerge as the victor. Angela tried to enjoy the trip and appreciate their friendship, but with each passing day, her patience was wearing thin.

It all came to a head one afternoon when they reached the Grand Canyon. Ordinarily, the breathtaking views would have captivated any visitor, but for Mary, it presented yet another opportunity for conquest. She challenged Angela to a race to the bottom, insisting they would only grow closer through this adventure.

Angela, however, had reached her breaking point. Instead of taking part in the race, she confronted Mary about her never-ending competitiveness and how it was hurting their friendship. Mary, never one to accept defeat, argued back, her voice echoing through the canyon, claiming that only a true friend would push their companion to be better.

What Mary failed to realize was her actions were far from being in the spirit of true friendship. Angela tried her best to explain to Mary that a friendship built on constant competition would ultimately lead nowhere. The value in being friends wasn't about being better than the other, but in being there for each other. Angela could no longer accept the one-sided nature of their friendship.

The sun began to set as they stood at the edge of the Grand Canyon, the vibrant hues painting the sky and reflecting in their tear-filled eyes. Mary hesitated, realizing the consequences of her actions and the irrevocable damage she had caused. She tried to apologize, but it was too late. Angela knew that for her sake, she had to take a step back and distance herself from a friendship that could never be healthy.

The road trip ended, and they returned home as different people – the distance growing between them. As the years went by, the two drifted apart. Each carved their path, guided by their distinct principles and values.

But, from that moment on, Angela realized the importance of cherishing true friendships, of loving unconditionally without the need for rivalry or bragging rights. And, as time slowly passed, perhaps Mary learned that lesson, too – the deep-rooted value of genuine connections built on love and mutual respect.
