 Kanye West, our favorite ladies blouse and leather skirt-wearing rapper, took to the stage at Revel in Atlantic City last night wearing his weirdest stage costumes yet. The "Cold" artist gave concertgoers a chilling performance dressed in all-white, including outrageous headpieces like this crystal-encrusted Maison Martin Margiela mask.
