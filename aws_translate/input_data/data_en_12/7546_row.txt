Title: Take a Knee? In BCS Title Hunt, It's Go for Throat

As college football enters the final weeks of the season, the stakes have never been higher. Teams jockey for the coveted spots in the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) rankings, and every decision becomes scrutinized and dissected by analysts and fans alike. However, one aspect of the game that has come under special attention is the sportsmanship aspect, specifically, the concept of taking a knee. While some coaches and players believe in showing mercy and respect towards their opponents through taking a knee, others argue that this is not just any regular season game – it is a high stakes BCS title hunt. Thus, "go for the throat" becomes a common mentality, prompting aggressive play calling and the relentless pursuit of victory.

In recent years, taking a knee has become a contentious issue in various sports. More often than not, we see teams with significant leads choosing to "salt the clock" by kneeling, thus ensuring a victory without further embarrassing their opponents. Some argue that this displays sportsmanship, while others contend that this is not always the case. In the realm of college football, however, the debate takes on added significance due to the BCS rankings. With the BCS rankings determined by a complex formula that considers various factors, including a team's strength of schedule, the coaches' and Harris Interactive Polls, as well as the average computer rankings, every point scored could impact the final standings.

Critics of the "go for the throat" mentality question whether college football has lost its sense of sportsmanship. They argue that the preoccupation with scores, rankings, and bowl games has turned the sport into a ruthless business, with players and coaches more concerned about their statistics and job security than with maintaining the traditions and values of the game. By running up the score, teams reinforce the notion that winning is the only thing that matters, and that any means justify the end.

However, proponents of this aggressive mentality argue that it ultimately brings out the best in teams and athletes. They believe that in the high-pressure BCS title hunt, there is no time for mercy or for taking it easy. The sport demands competitors push themselves to the absolute limit, with the knowledge that their efforts on the field can make or break their chance at that elusive BCS title. By going for the throat, teams are only utilizing their full potential and playing to the best of their abilities. The pursuit of victory is quintessential to the spirit of the sport, and the BCS atmosphere only amplifies this.

Additionally, those who support "going for the throat" argue that it is better to face the reality of the BCS rankings and play accordingly than to pretend it doesn't exist. As a team, the goal is ultimately to win, and if running up the score is part of the strategy, then so be it. Furthermore, they contend there is no hard and fast rule that declaring they should ease off the pedal in the final minutes of a game when victory is all but assured. Every team is different, and there will always be disagreements regarding the right approach in these situations.

As the race for the BCS title continues to heat up, the discussion surrounding sportsmanship and competitiveness will likely persist. While some may argue for the traditional approach of taking a knee and demonstrating mercy, others will contend that these are extraordinary circumstances. The BCS title hunt is not just another regular season game – it is a championship pursuit where every point matters, and for many, "going for the throat" is deemed an essential part of achieving their ultimate goal.
