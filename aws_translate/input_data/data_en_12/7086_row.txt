Q: Alex has 4 pens in the first week of a month. Every week her pen collection doubles. How many more pens will Alex have than Jane if Jane will have 16 pens after a month?
A: If Alex has 4 pens in the first week of a month, she will have 4 * 2 = 8 pens in the second week. After her pen collection doubles in the third week, Alex will have 2 * 8 = 16 pens. In the last week of the month, Alex will have 2 * 16 = 32 pens after her pen collection. If Jane has 16 pens after a month, Alex will have 32 - 16 = 16 more pens than Jane. The answer is 16.

[Question]A curry house sells curries that have varying levels of spice. Recently, a lot of the customers have been ordering very mild curries and the chefs have been having to throw away some wasted ingredients. To reduce cost and food wastage, the curry house starts monitoring how many ingredients are actually being used and changes their spending accordingly. The curry house needs 3 peppers for very spicy curries, 2 peppers for spicy curries, and only 1 pepper for mild curries. After adjusting their purchasing, the curry house now buys the exact amount of peppers they need. Previously, the curry house was buying enough peppers for 30 very spicy curries, 30 spicy curries, and 10 mild curries. They now buy enough peppers for 15 spicy curries and 90 mild curries. They no longer sell very spicy curries. How many fewer peppers does the curry house now buy?
[Answer]The curry house previously bought 3 peppers per very spicy curry * 30 very spicy curries = 90 peppers for very spicy curries. They also bought 2 peppers per spicy curry * 30 spicy curries = 60 peppers for spicy curries. They also bought 1 pepper per mild curry * 10 mild curries = 10 peppers for mild curries. So they were previously buying 90 + 60 + 10 = 160 peppers. They now buy 2 peppers per spicy curry * 15 spicy curries = 30 peppers for spicy curries. They also now buy 1 pepper per mild curry * 90 mild curries = 90 peppers for mild curries. So they now buy 30 + 90 = 120 peppers. This is a difference of 160 peppers bought originally - 120 peppers bought now = 40 peppers. The answer is 40.
Q: Four people in a law firm are planning a party. Mary will buy a platter of pasta for $20 and a loaf of bread for $2. Elle and Andrea will split the cost for buying 4 cans of soda which cost $1.50 each, and chicken wings for $10. Joe will buy a cake that costs $5. How much more will Mary spend than the rest of the firm put together?
A: Mary will spend $20 + $2 = $22. Elle and Andrea will spend $1.5 x 4 = $6 for the soda. Elle and Andrea will spend $6 + $10 = $16 for the soda and chicken wings. Elle, Andrea, and Joe together will spend $16 + $5 = $21. So, Mary will spend $22 - $21 = $1 more than all of them combined. The answer is 1.
