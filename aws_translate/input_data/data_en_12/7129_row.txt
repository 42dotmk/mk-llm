Q: My new house has 12 medium ceiling lights but I have seen small and large ceiling lights in other rooms. The small ones require 1 bulb, the medium ones require 2, and the large ones need 3 bulbs. How many bulbs should I buy if my wife says she saw twice as many large ceiling lights as medium ceiling lights and ten more small lights than medium ones?
A: If the house has twice the number of large ones as medium ones then the house has 2 * 12 = 24 large ceiling lights. Similarly, if it has 10 more small ones than the 12 medium ones then it has 10 + 12 = 22 small ceiling lights. If one small ceiling light requires 1 bulb then 22 small ones will require 1 * 22 = 22 bulbs. If one medium ceiling light requires 2 bulbs then 12 medium ones will require 2 * 12 = 24 bulbs. If one large ceiling light requires 3 bulbs then 24 medium ones will require 3 * 24 = 72 bulbs. Therefore the house will require 22 bulbs for the small ones + 24 bulbs for the medium ones + 72 bulbs for the large ones, for a total of 22 + 24 + 72 = 118. The answer is 118.
Question: The math questions in a contest are divided into three rounds: easy, average, and hard. There are corresponding points given for each round. That is 2, 3, and 5 points for every correct answer in the easy, average, and hard rounds, respectively. Suppose Kim got 6 correct answers in the easy; 2 correct answers in the average; and 4 correct answers in the difficult round, what are her total points in the contest?
Answer: Kim got 6 points / round x 2 round = 12 points in the easy round. She got 2 points / round x 3 rounds = 6 points in the average round. She got 4 points / round x 5 rounds = 20 points in the difficult round. So her total points is 12 points + 6 points + 20 points = 38 points. The answer is 38.
[Question]Kristy, a sales representative earns a basic salary of $7.50 per hour plus a 16% commission on everything she sells. This month, she worked for 160 hours and sold $25000 worth of items. Her monthly budget for food, clothing, rent, transportation, bills and savings is 95% of her total monthly earnings and the rest will be put towards insurance. How much did she allocate to insurance?
[Answer]Kristy earns a basic salary of $7.50 x 160 = $1200. Her total commission is $25000 x 16 / 100 = $4000. Thus, her total earning is $1200 + $4000 = $5200. Her monthly budget aside from the insurance is $5200 x 95 / 100 = $4940. Therefore, she allocated $5200 - $4940 = $260 on insurance. The answer is 260.
Q: Erica lives near a lake where most locals sell fish as their main source of income, earning $20 per kg of fish. She goes out fishing today and catches twice as many fish as she caught in total in the past four months. If Erica trawled 80 kg of fish in the past four months, not including today, how much money will she have earned in the past four months including today (assuming she sells all her fish)?
A: In the past four months, not including today, Erica has 80 kg * $20 / kg = $1600 worth of fish. Today, Erica trawled 80 * 2 = 160 kg of fish. Thus today's earnings are 160 kg * $20 / kg = $3200. Her total earnings are $3200 + $1600 = $4800. The answer is 4800.
