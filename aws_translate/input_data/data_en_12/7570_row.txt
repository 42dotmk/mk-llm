[Question]A concert ticket costs $40. Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets and received a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10. How much did Mr. Benson pay in all?
[Answer]Mr. Benson had a 5% discount for each of the 12 - 10 = 2 tickets. So, those two tickets had a $40 x 5 / 100 = $2 discount each. Hence, each ticket cost $40 - $2 = $38 each. Thus, two discounted tickets amount to $38 x 2 = $76. And the other ten tickets amount to $40 x 10 = $400. Hence, Mr. Benson paid a total of $400 + $76 = $476. The answer is 476.
Q: John has a donkey and an elephant. The elephant weighs 3 tons (a ton is 2000 pounds). The donkey weighs 90% less. What is their combined weight in pounds?
A: The elephant weighs 3 * 2000 = 6000 pounds. The donkey weighs 6000 * .9 = 5400 pounds less. So the donkey weighs 6000 - 5400 = 600 pounds. That means the combined weight is 600 + 6000 = 6600 pounds. The answer is 6600.
Question: Lisa has 36 candies. On Mondays and Wednesdays, she eats 2 candies for each day and on the other days of the week she eats 1 candy for each day. How many weeks does it take for Lisa to eat all of the candies?
Answer: On Monday and Tuesday, she eats 2 * 2 = 4 candies. On the other days of the week, she eats 5 * 1 = 5 candies. In a week she eats 5 + 4 = 9 candies. So it takes 36 / 9 = 4 weeks for Lisa to eat all candies. The answer is 4.
[Question]Ronald wants to make profits by re-selling some phones he bought a week ago. He bought 200 units for just $3000, and he wants to gain a third of the initial investment in profits when all units are sold. Including the profit margin, what will be the selling price for each phone?
[Answer]The profit Ronald wants is $3000 / 3 = $1000. The profit per phone sold will be $1000 / 200 phones = $5 / phone. The cost of each phone is $3000 / 200 phones = $15 / phone. The selling price including the profit will be $15 / phone + $5 / phone = $20. The answer is 20.
Q: There are six unicorns in the Enchanted Forest. Everywhere a unicorn steps, four flowers spring into bloom. The six unicorns are going to walk all the way across the forest side-by-side, a journey of 9 kilometers. If each unicorn moves 3 meters forward with each step, how many flowers bloom because of this trip?
A: First convert the total length of the journey from kilometers to meters: 9 kilometers * 1000 meters / kilometer = 9000 meters. Then divide this by the length of one step to find the number of steps in the journey: 9000 meters / 3 meters / step = 3000 steps. Then multiply the number of steps by the number of flowers per step to find how many flowers one unicorn creates on the journey: 3000 steps * 4 flowers / step = 12000 flowers. Then multiply the number of flowers per unicorn by the number of unicorns to find the total number of flowers created: 12000 flowers / unicorn * 6 unicorns = 72,000 flowers. The answer is 72000.
