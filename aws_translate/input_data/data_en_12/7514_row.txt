To accomplish the goal of forming the melted beeswax and shea butter mixture into a usable shape as a lip balm, follow these detailed steps:

1. Gather the necessary ingredients and materials:
   - Beeswax pellets or beeswax block
   - Shea butter
   - A double boiler or a makeshift version using a heat-safe glass bowl and a saucepan
   - Heat-resistant spatula or wooden spoon
   - Essential oil(s) for scent or flavor (optional)
   - Lip balm containers (plastic tubes, tins, or pots)
   - Small funnel or pipette (optional, but helpful for precise pouring)
   - Clean towel or paper towel for cleanup

2. Prepare the double boiler:
   - Fill the bottom part of the double boiler (or the saucepan in the makeshift version) with 1 to 2 inches of water.
   - Place the top part of the double boiler (or the heat-safe glass bowl) on top, making sure that the water doesn't touch the bottom of the top part.
   - Have the heat-resistant spatula or wooden spoon nearby for stirring.

3. Weigh and melt the beeswax and shea butter:
   - Weigh the beeswax and shea butter using a kitchen scale. A typical lip balm recipe calls for a 1:1 ratio of beeswax and shea butter (e.g., 2 ounces of each). This may vary depending on your desired texture and consistency.
   - Place the beeswax and shea butter in the top part of the double boiler.
   - Turn the stove to low heat to slowly melt the beeswax and shea butter. Stir occasionally with the heat-resistant spatula or wooden spoon to ensure even melting and to prevent scorching.
   - Once the mixture is completely melted, remove the double boiler from the heat to avoid overheating the mixture.

4. Add essential oils (optional):
   - If you'd like to add essential oils for scent or flavor, do so at this stage. Make sure to use lip-safe essential oils and follow the recommended dilutions. 5-10 drops of essential oil per 1 ounce of lip balm mixture is usually a good guideline.
   - Stir the mixture thoroughly to disperse the essential oils evenly.

5. Pour the mixture into the lip balm containers:
   - Place the lip balm containers on a flat surface, such as a countertop or table, with the lids removed. Make sure they are completely dry and clean.
   - Using a steady hand or the small funnel or pipette, carefully pour the melted lip balm mixture into each container. Work reasonably quickly, as the mixture will start to solidify as it cools.
   - Fill each container almost to the top, leaving a little space for the lip balm to contract as it cools and hardens.

6. Allow the lip balm mixture to set:
   - After pouring the mixture into the containers, allow it to cool and harden at room temperature. This may take a couple of hours, depending on the size of the containers and the room temperature.
   - To speed up the setting process, you can place the filled containers in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.
   - Avoid touching the mixture while it hardens to prevent leaving dents or finger marks.

7. Seal and store the lip balm:
   - Once the lip balm has hardened, place the lids on the containers and secure them tightly.
   - Store the lip balm in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight or heat sources.

8. Clean up:
   - Wipe any spilled mixture from surfaces with a clean towel or paper towels before it hardens.
   - Wash the double boiler, spatula or wooden spoon, and any other tools used with warm, soapy water. If there is any residue, it may help to heat the tools slightly to loosen the wax before washing.

By following these steps diligently, you will have successfully formed the melted beeswax and shea butter mixture into a usable shape as a lip balm. You can now enjoy your homemade lip balm or even gift it to friends and family.
