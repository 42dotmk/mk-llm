Although both questions involve exporting onions from India to another country, they are not paraphrases of each other as the destination countries are different: London (United Kingdom) and Canada. However, the process for exporting onions will share several similarities, with additional steps or considerations specific to each destination. Here is the general process for each case:

Exporting onions from India to London:

1. Research and understand the market demand for onions in London and get to know the various regulations and standards required for exporting agricultural products to the United Kingdom.

2. Obtain necessary licenses and registrations, including the Importer Exporter Code (IEC) issued by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade in India. Also, ensure that your business is registered with the relevant tax departments.

3. Find reliable suppliers of onions in India who adhere to the standards and packaging requirements set by the United Kingdom. This may involve inspections and quality checks on the products.

4. Establish contact with potential buyers in London, like wholesalers, retailers, supermarkets, and grocery store chains. You can find buyers through market research, online sources, trade expos, and by joining industry-specific forums.

5. Set up a contract with your chosen buyers and finalize the shipping terms, pricing, and delivery deadlines.

6. Arrange for appropriate transportation, ensuring that your chosen shipping company is experienced in handling agricultural exports and deals with proper phytosanitary certificates.

7. Ensure that the onions are properly packed, fumigated, and adhere to the United Kingdom's import requirements regarding size, appearance, and labeling.

8. Organize customs clearance and necessary documentation at both the Indian export location and upon arrival in London.

9. Monitor the shipment and provide proper documentation to your buyer. Ensure payment is collected as per the agreed-upon terms.

Exporting onions from India to Canada:

1. Conduct market research and investigate the demand for onions in Canada along with their specific regulations and standards for importing agricultural products.

2. Acquire the necessary licenses and registrations for exporting, including the IEC from the Directorate General of Foreign Trade in India and registration with relevant tax departments.

3. Locate dependable suppliers of onions in India, ensuring they are compliant with the quality and packaging standards set by Canada.

4. Identify potential buyers in Canada, such as wholesalers, retailers, supermarkets, and grocery stores. Use various channels, like market research, online sources, trade expos, and industry forums to make connections.

5. Negotiate and establish contracts with your Canadian buyers, finalizing terms like shipping, pricing, and delivery deadlines.

6. Coordinate with a shipping company that has experience handling agricultural exports and can provide the necessary phytosanitary certificates for Canada.

7. Make sure the onions are appropriately packed, fumigated, and meet Canadian import requirements in terms of sizing, appearance, and labeling.

8. Organize customs clearance, documentation, and inspections in India and Canada.

9. Keep track of the shipment and provide documentation to your buyer. Collect payment per the agreed-upon terms.

Essentially, the process for exporting onions to both London and Canada from India has overlapping steps, but because the destination countries differ, the regulatory requirements and potential buyers will vary. The two questions are not paraphrases as they address two different export scenarios.
