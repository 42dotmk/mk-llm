Title: "Shadows of Freedom"

Act 1:

"Shadows of Freedom" kicks off with an introduction to Congressman Robert Clifton, a charismatic yet corrupt figure possessing immense power and influence in Washington D.C. Despite his charm and elegant facade, he has a host of ruthless enemies due to his draconian policies and the various shady deals he has sealed behind closed bureaucratic doors.

Moving into the heart of Washington D.C., we introduce our protagonist, Sam, a seemingly average blue-collar worker with a unique past. Sam, who was once an expert in pyrotechnics has now relinquished his exciting life for the mundanity of a firefighter’s duty. Unbeknownst to those around him, Sam's proficiency with explosives resulted from a stint with the U.S. military in an elite EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) unit.

Act 2:

After crossing paths with Clifton at a political rally, where Clifton's ignoble and wicked ways were on full display, Sam's indignation surges. Meanwhile, his deeper past is revealed - his brother was ruined by a policy Clifton advocated, leaving his family desolate, which resulted in his brother's tragic suicide. 

The plot thickens as Sam is approached by a cryptic group that calls themselves "The Vanguard of Liberty." This organization comprises citizens deeply wronged by Clifton's actions, and they task Sam with using his old skills to orchestrate Clifton’s death in a way that sparks questions rather than providing answers - a grand fireworks display during an independence day rally. 

Act 3:

Sam initially refuses, torn over using his skills for such a destructive purpose. However, remembering his brother's death and the suffering of countless other families due to the congressman's policies, he finally agrees. Meanwhile, the Congressman continues his reckless streak of exploitation and corruption, further highlighting his deservingness of the fate planned for him.

Sam's meticulous prep begins with stakes escalating with each passing minute. He stealthily gathers materials, designs the damning fireworks scheme, and infiltrates the team overseeing the Independence Day rally's fireworks, all while navigating around prying federal agencies and the watchful eyes of Clifton's private security.

Act 4:

Finally, the day arrives. The tension mounts as Sam's plan goes into motion. The feel of the event is festive, far from the imminent chaos about to ensue. As Sam's heartbeat synchronises with the ticking clock, the Congressman takes the stage, unknowing of his impending doom.

Just as the congressman's pompous speech reaches it's peak, the firework gear planted by Sam detonates, not in the sky as part of the planned spectacle, but on stage, enveloping Clifton in an inferno of colored flames; a spectacle morbid yet mesmerising.

Act 5:

Before anyone can comprehend the chaotic scene, Sam swiftly slips away, minutes from being exposed by a suspicious security officer. The news of Clifton's violent death spreads like wildfire, and while an atmosphere of shock and horror envelopes Washington, there is a silent sigh of relief amongst the disenfranchised masses.

In the closing scenes, we see Sam, lying low, watching the consequences of his actions on a small TV in a roadside diner. While there is regret for the chaos he caused, he finds solace in his belief of having served justice. The movie ends with Sam's sigh of relief, leaving the audience to wonder if Sam will be able to live a normal life or if he will be pursued.

In conclusion, "Shadows of Freedom” is a riveting political thriller that explores themes of power, corruption, vengeance, and justice, all set against the backdrop of a tumultuous political climate – making for an unforgettable cinematic experience.
