[Question]Bert's golden retriever has grown tremendously since it was a puppy. At 7 weeks old, the puppy weighed 6 pounds, but doubled in weight by week 9. It doubled in weight again at 3 months old, and doubled again at 5 months old. Finally, the dog reached its final adult weight by adding another 30 pounds by the time it was one year old. What is the dog's full adult weight, in pounds?
[Answer]At 7 weeks old, the puppy weighed 6 pounds, but doubled in weight by week 9 to reach a weight of 6 * 2 = 12 pounds. It doubled in weight again at 3 months old to reach a weight of 12 * 2 = 24 pounds. It doubled in weight again at 5 months old to reach a weight of 24 * 2 = 48 pounds. And it reached its full adult weight by adding another 30 lbs to reach a final weight of 48 + 30 = 78 pounds. The answer is 78.
Q: Yasna has two books. One book is 180 pages long, and the other book is 100 pages long. If Yasna wants to finish both of the books in two weeks, how many pages will Yasna need to read every day, if she reads an equal number of pages each day?
A: The total number of pages is 180 + 100 = 280 pages. The number of pages Yasna needs to read every day for two weeks is 280 / 14 = 20 pages. The answer is 20.
Question: Aisha enjoys listening to music on her mp3 player. She starts with 500 songs on her mp3 player, then adds another 500 the week after that. She realizes her mp3 player has a large capacity for storing songs so she adds twice the amount she already had on her mp3 player. After a while, though, she decides that she doesn't like 50 of the songs and removes them. How many songs are on Aisha's mp3 player now?
Answer: Aisha starts with 500 songs + 500 songs = 1000 songs added to her mp3 player in the first two weeks. After that Aisha adds twice that amount to her mp3 player, 1000 x 2 = 2000 songs added. She now has 1000 + 2000 = 3000 songs on her mp3 player. However, she decides she wants to remove 50 of them, 3000 - 50 = 2950 songs on her mp3 player. The answer is 2950.
[Question]Sharon wants to get kitchen supplies. She admired Angela's kitchen supplies which consist of 20 pots, 6 more than three times as many plates as the pots, and half as many cutlery as the plates. Sharon wants to buy half as many pots as Angela, 20 less than three times as many plates as Angela, and twice as much cutlery as Angela. What is the total number of kitchen supplies Sharon wants to buy?
[Answer]Angela has 6 + 3 * 20 = 66 plates. Angela has 1 / 2 * 66 = 33 cutlery. Sharon wants to buy 1 / 2 * 20 = 10 pots. Sharon wants to buy 3 * 66 - 20 = 178 plates. Sharon wants to buy 2 * 33 = 66 cutlery. Sharon wants to buy a total of 10 + 178 + 66 = 254 kitchen supplies. The answer is 254.
Q: Anthony and his friend Leonel read about the importance of keeping pets at home and decided to start adopting cats and dogs from the local rescue center. Anthony has 12 cats and dogs, 2/3 of which are cats. Leonel has half times as many cats as Anthony and seven more dogs than Anthony. How many animals in total do the two have?
A: If Anthony has 12 pets, the number of cats is 2 / 3 * 12 pets = 8 cats. The number of dogs that Anthony have is 12 pets - 8 cats = 4 dogs. Leonel has 1 / 2 * 8 cats = 4 cats. If Leonel has seven more dogs than Anthony, then he has 4 dogs + 7 dogs = 11 dogs. The total number of pets the two have is 11 dogs for Leonel + 4 cats for Leonel + 4 dogs for Anthony + 8 cats for Anthony = 27. The answer is 27.
