These two questions do carry a similar meaning, with both emphasizing the hypothetical scenario in which Muslims never existed. However, the first question is more direct, while the second one is framed to ask about the consequences or implications of Muslims never having existed. To answer the question on this hypothetical scenario, we will take a look at various aspects of history, society, culture, and science that have been influenced by Muslims or the Islamic civilization.

1. Historical Impact

One of the most significant Muslim contributions to history is the Islamic Golden Age, which lasted from the 8th to the 14th centuries. Many significant advances in science, philosophy, and art occurred during this time, which originated in the Middle East and later influenced other parts of the world. Without Muslims, the Islamic Golden Age would not have happened, which could have led to a delay or even discontinuity in the development of mathematics, natural sciences, philosophy, and literature.

Moreover, the Islamic Empire would not have been established. This empire was one of the largest in history, stretching from Spain to northern India and Central Asia. Without the Muslim influence in these areas, the political landscape would have been very different in key historical periods, such as during the Crusades and the age of exploration.

2. Society and Culture

Muslim culture and Islamic values greatly influenced art, poetry, music, and architecture. Many iconic buildings, such as the Alhambra in Granada, Spain, and the Great Mosque of Cordoba, would not have been constructed. The intricate Islamic geometric designs found in many art forms would also not exist without the Muslim influence.

In addition to physical contributions, the Islamic world also made significant contributions to literature. Classic works like One Thousand and One Nights would not have been written or preserved. The world would also be devoid of renowned Muslim poets like Rumi and Hafez, whose works continue to inspire people across the globe.

3. Scientific and Technological Contributions

The Islamic Golden Age saw major advancements in scientific fields, such as medicine, astronomy, mathematics, and chemistry. Without Muslims, great scholars like Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen), and Al-Khwarizmi, who developed the concept of algorithms in mathematics, might not have made such significant contributions.

Pioneering medical texts, such as the Canon of Medicine by Avicenna, significantly impacted the study and practice of medicine globally. Similarly, the fields of optics, astronomy, and mechanical engineering benefited from the contributions of Muslim scholars like al-Haytham, al-Biruni, and Al-Jazari.

4. Religious Influence

If Muslims did not exist, the religion of Islam would not have spread across the world. Today, Islam is the second-largest religion globally, with around 1.8 billion followers. Moreover, the world would not have experienced the encounter, dialogue, and exchange of ideas between Islam and other major world religions, such as Christianity, Judaism, and Hinduism, which helped shape the history of interreligious understanding and conflicts.

In conclusion, if Muslims had never existed, the world would have been a very different place. From historical events to cultural, scientific, and technological advancements, the absence of Muslims would have dramatically altered the course of human history. While it is impossible to predict precisely the alternative outcomes that would have arisen without Muslim existence, it is clear that their contributions have had a significant and lasting impact on global society.
