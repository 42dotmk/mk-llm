Q: Mrs. Carlton gives out penalty points whenever her students misbehave. They get 5 points for interrupting, 10 points for insulting their classmates, and 25 points for throwing things. If they get 100 points, they have to go to the office. Jerry already interrupted twice and insulted his classmates 4 times. How many times can he throw things before he gets sent to the office?
A: For interrupting, Jerry got 5 points per interruption * 2 interruptions = 10 points. For insulting, he got 10 points per insult * 4 insults = 40 points. To get to the 100 limit points, Jerry has 100 points - 10 points - 40 points = 50 points left. He still has 50 points / 25 points per throw = 2 throws. The answer is 2.
Question: Jane plans on reading a novel she borrows from her friend. She reads twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. In the morning she reads 5 pages and in the evening she reads 10 pages. If she reads at this rate for a week, how many pages will she read?
Answer: The number of pages Jane reads in a day is 5 in the morning and 10 in the evening, so she reads 10 + 5 = 15 pages in a day. If she reads for a week she reads for 7 days, so by the end of the week she reads 15 * 7 = 105 pages. The answer is 105.
[Question]An archaeologist discovered three dig sites from different periods in one area. The archaeologist dated the first dig site as 352 years more recent than the second dig site. The third dig site was dated 3700 years older than the first dig site. The fourth dig site was twice as old as the third dig site. The archaeologist studied the fourth dig siteâ€™s relics and gave the site a date of 8400 BC. What year did the archaeologist date the second dig site?
[Answer]The third dig site was dated from the year 8400 / 2 = 4200 BC. Thus, the first dig site was dated from the year 4200 - 3700 = 500 BC. The second dig site was 352 years older, so it was dated from the year 500 + 352 = 852 BC. The answer is 852.

Question: In Alaska the commercial Cod fishing season runs from January 1 - August 1 lasting exactly 7 months, or 213 days on a non-leap year. Two fishermen are competing against each other to see who can earn more profit. The first fisherman plans to catch fish at a steady rate of 3 per day for the entire season. The second fisherman is a novice who will need to start more slowly. He plans to catch only 1 fish per day during the first 30 days, 2 fish per day during the next 60 days, and then 4 fish per day during the remainder of the season. At the end of the season, how many more fish will be caught by the fisherman who catches the higher number of fish?
Answer: The first fisherman will catch 3 * 213 = 639 fish during the season. The second fisherman catch 1 * 30 + 2 * 60 = 150 fish during the first 90 days of the season. Then, during the remaining 213 - 90 = 123 days of the season, the second fisherman will can an additional 4 * 123 = 492 fish. Thus, the second fisherman will catch a total of 150 + 492 = 642 fish. Therefore, the second fisherman will catch 642 - 639 = 3 more fish than the first fisherman at the end of the season. The answer is 3.
