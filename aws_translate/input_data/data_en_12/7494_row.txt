Question: Passage: The term Tyndale's Bible is not strictly correct, because Tyndale never published a complete Bible. That task was completed by Miles Coverdale who supplemented Tyndale's translations with his own to produce the first complete printed bible in English in 1535. Prior to his execution Tyndale had only finished translating the entire New Testament and roughly half of the Old Testament. Of the latter, the Pentateuch, Jonah and a revised version of the book of Genesis were published during his lifetime. His other Old Testament works were first used in the creation of the Matthew Bible and also heavily influenced every major English translation of the Bible that followed.

Question: Based on this passage, who completed tyndales english translation of the bible?
Answer: The relevant information is: That task was completed by Miles Coverdale who supplemented Tyndale's translations with his own to produce the first complete printed bible in English in 1535. The answer is Miles Coverdale.

Question: At liquid -- air interfaces, surface tension results from the greater attraction of liquid molecules to each other (due to cohesion) than to the molecules in the air (due to adhesion). The net effect is an inward force at its surface that causes the liquid to behave as if its surface were covered with a stretched elastic membrane. Thus, the surface becomes under tension from the imbalanced forces, which is probably where the term "surface tension" came from. Because of the relatively high attraction of water molecules for each other through a web of hydrogen bonds, water has a higher surface tension (72.8 millinewtons per meter at 20 Â° C) compared to that of most other liquids. Surface tension is an important factor in the phenomenon of capillarity.

Based on this passage, what is the high surface tension of water due to?
Answer:
