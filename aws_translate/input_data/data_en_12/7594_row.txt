Question: Hector purchased a container of gumballs. He gave 4 to Todd, then he gave twice as many as he had given Todd to Alisha, and then he gave 5 less than four times as many to Bobby as he had given to Alisha. If Hector had 6 gumballs remaining, what is the total number of gumballs that Hector purchased?
Answer: Hector gave to Alisha twice as many as he had given Todd, for a total of 4 * 2 = 8 gumballs,. Hector gave 5 less than four times as many to Bobby as he had given to Alisha, or a total of (8 * 4) - 5 = 27 gumballs. If Hector had 6 gumballs remaining, he originally purchased 4 + 8 + 27 + 6 = 45 gumballs. The answer is 45.
[Question]Charlotte is a dog walker and is creating a schedule for all of her clients this week. Each dog is walked separately. On Monday, she needs to walk 4 poodles and 2 Chihuahuas. On Tuesday, she walks the same amount of Chihuahuas but isn't sure how many poodles she should walk. On Wednesday, she walks 4 Labradors. It takes 2 hours to walk a poodle, 1 hour to walk a Chihuahua, and 3 hours to walk a Labrador. If she has time for a total of 32 hours spent in dog-walking this week, how many poodles can Charlotte walk on Tuesday?
[Answer]On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles. On Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas. On Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas. On Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors. Over the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 24 hours spent dog - walking. This means she still has 32 maximum hours â€“ 24 used hours = 8 hours available for dog - walking. Therefore, she can walk 8 hours / 2 hours per poodle = 4 poodles on Tuesday. The answer is 4.

Question: Mary is making a model sailboat. She wants to add three sails: a rectangular sail that measures 5 inches by 8 inches and two right triangular sails, one that's 3 inches long at the bottom and 4 inches tall and one that's 4 inches long at the bottom and 6 inches tall. (Remember you can find the area of a triangle by dividing the area of a square with the same height and length by 2). How many square inches of canvas does she need total?
Answer: First find the area of the square sail: 5 inches * 8 inches = 40 square inches. Then find the area of a square sail with the same height and length as the first triangular sail: 3 inches * 4 inches = 12 square inches. Then divide the area in two to find the area of the triangular sail: 12 square inches / 2 = 6 square inches. Then find the area of a square sail with the same height and length as the second triangular sail: 4 inches * 6 inches = 24 square inches. Then divide the area in two to find the area of the triangular sail: 24 square inches / 2 = 12 square inches. Then add up the areas of all the sails to find the total amount of canvas needed: 12 square inches + 6 square inches + 40 square inches = 58 square inches. The answer is 58.
