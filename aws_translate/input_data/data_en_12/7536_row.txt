Harness racing, as a popular horse racing discipline, has found a significant following around the world and, as a result, different countries have developed their unique variations of the sport. Here is a detailed and long answer describing the variations of harness racing in different countries. 

1. United States: The sport of harness racing originated in the United States and is known for its Standardbred horses. Two forms of pacing races are widespread in the US - trotting and pacing. Trotting is a gait where diagonally opposite legs move in tandem, while pacing is a gait where lateral legs move together. The races typically take place on mile-long oval racetracks, and the feature of starting gates is common. The events are often categorized by the horses' ages, sex, and career earnings.

2. Canada: As a close neighbor to the United States, the Canadian harness racing scene is quite similar. Standardbred horses dominate the races, and both trotting and pacing are popular. Canada is home to numerous prestigious harness racing events, such as the North America Cup, the Maple Leaf Trot, and the Canadian Pacing Derby. Like their American counterparts, Canadian races also use starting gates and take place at oval racetracks.

3. France: Known as 'trotting' in France, harness racing is referred to as "course de trot" and predominantly features trotting races. French trotters are the primary breed, and races are divided into two categories - mounted and driven. In mounted races, jockeys ride on the horse's back, and in driven races, they sit on sulky carts. French racetracks are unique in that they often feature both right-handed and left-handed tracks that range from 1,000 to 4,000 meters in length. Also, handicapped starts based on the horses' earnings are common in France. The most prestigious race in France is the Prix d'Amerique, held annually since 1920.

4. Italy: In Italy, harness racing primarily focuses on trotters, with Italian-bred trotters dominating the sport. Trotting races can either be driven or monté (ridden). Flat and hilly racetracks are used, and many tracks have mixed surfaces (dirt and grass). Races in Italy are typically longer, ranging from 1,600 to 3,000 meters in length. Popular contests include the Gran Premio Orsi Mangelli, Gran Premio Lotteria, and Gran Premio Mipaaft.

5. Scandinavia: This region is known for its excellent cold-blooded trotters. Harness racing in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland sees significant interest from participants and spectators. Races are exclusively trotting and driven, with no pacing or monté races. The tracks are mostly left-handed oval tracks ranging from 800 to 1,000 meters. Major Scandinavian events include the Elitloppet in Sweden, the Copenhagen Cup in Denmark, and the Finnish Trotting Derby in Finland.

6. Australia and New Zealand: Harness racing in these countries heavily features pacing with Standardbred horses. Races are conducted on circular and oval tracks, with both left and right-handed tracks in use. The New Zealand Cup and the Miracle Mile in Australia are among the most popular races in the region. The New Zealand "dual-gaited" horse - a horse capable of both trotting and pacing during races - is unique to this corner of the world and adds an interesting twist to the sport.

In conclusion, while there are distinct differences in harness racing traditions across the world, the sport's core principles and exciting nature captivate fans and participants alike. From the pacing and trotting variations of North America to the exclusively trotting races of Europe and Scandinavia, the breed variations and cultural differences contribute to the sport's enduring appeal and worldwide popularity.
