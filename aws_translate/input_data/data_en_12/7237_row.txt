Both Sudan and South Sudan need to address massive humanitarian needs.

In both countries, there are extensive humanitarian challenges that require significant attention and support from the international community. These challenges stem from a variety of factors, including the impact of civil wars, political instability, economic crises, and natural disasters like severe droughts and floods.

First and foremost, the issue of displacement affects millions of people in Sudan and South Sudan. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are more than two million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Sudan and around 1.6 million IDPs in South Sudan, as of 2021. Large numbers of refugees have also fled to neighboring countries, such as Uganda, Ethiopia, and Kenya. Many of these individuals live in overcrowded camps, have limited access to basic services like healthcare and education, and face protection risks.

Another major challenge is food insecurity. The civil wars and ongoing conflict, as well as widespread poverty in the region, have negatively affected agricultural production and hindered humanitarian access to many locations. In South Sudan, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network estimated in November 2021 that over seven million people are in need of humanitarian food assistance, representing more than half of the population. On the other hand, Sudan has faced a series of crises in recent years that have increased food prices, making it difficult for millions of Sudanese households to afford adequate nutrition.

Ensuring access to water, sanitation, and hygiene is also crucial to the wellbeing of communities in both countries. Many IDP and refugee camps struggle to provide safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities, leading to the potential spread of waterborne diseases like cholera and diarrhea. In addition, the lack of proper sanitation infrastructure can also contribute to conflicts over limited resources and heighten protection risks.

Healthcare is another area that demands attention in both Sudan and South Sudan. The healthcare systems in both countries have been severely affected by years of conflict. In South Sudan, only around 44% of the population has access to healthcare services, while in Sudan, the situation is slightly better with about 70% having access. But, the ongoing economic crisis in Sudan is taking a toll on the healthcare system. A shortage of medical supplies, insufficient funding, and damaged infrastructure all contribute to the problem. As a result, there is an increased risk of disease outbreaks and limited access to essential health services.

Finally, education is another area where both countries face challenges. According to UNICEF, more than 2.2 million children in South Sudan are out of school, which is one of the highest rates of out-of-school children in the world. Similar challenges exist in Sudan, where around 3.6 million children are also out of school. Efforts to provide education for children are hampered by a variety of factors, such as inadequate infrastructure, a lack of teachers and learning materials, and ongoing conflict and insecurity.

Given these pressing humanitarian needs in both Sudan and South Sudan, it is vital that the international community not only provides financial and material support but also seeks lasting political solutions to the underlying issues that contribute to these crises. A focus on peacebuilding, fostering resilience, and addressing the root causes of conflict and displacement will be essential in enabling both countries to overcome these immense challenges and secure a better future for their people.
