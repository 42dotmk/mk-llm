The European Citizens' Initiative represents a fundamental step in the process of building a Europe based on citizens' rights.

The European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) is a unique and innovative instrument in the area of participatory democracy within the European Union. It allows citizens from different EU member states to come together and propose new legislation, aiming to address issues that directly affect their lives and the development of the Union. This tool aims to strengthen European democracy, foster a sense of citizenship, and bring the EU closer to its citizens.

Introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2007, and fully implemented in 2012, the ECI has the potential to empower citizens, offering them a more direct and tangible way to engage in decision-making at the European level. Through the ECI, citizens can gather signatures in support of a specific legislative proposal, and, once the required threshold is reached, the European Commission is obliged to consider the proposal and decide whether to draft legislation.

To launch an ECI, a citizen committee must be formed, consisting of at least seven EU citizens residing in at least seven different member states. This ensures that the initiative carries transnational weight and is not limited to the concerns of one particular country. The committee must then register their proposed ECI with the European Commission, providing a clear legal basis, objectives, and background information. If approved, the committee has one year to collect the necessary signatures of support from EU citizens, which currently stands at one million, with a minimum number required from each member state.

The role of the European Citizens' Initiative in the EU legislative process highlights the importance of active citizenship and engagement in shaping the future of Europe. The ECI not only creates opportunities for citizens to influence policy and legislation but also promotes a European identity by fostering cooperation and dialogue among citizens from different cultures and backgrounds. Moreover, it empowers citizens to make their voices heard on a wide range of issues, from social and economic matters to environmental and human rights concerns.

Despite its potential to strengthen European democracy, the European Citizens' Initiative faces various challenges. Some of these include low public awareness, complex procedures, and the limited scope for legislative change. Since its implementation, only a few ECIs have reached the necessary threshold for consideration by the Commission, and even fewer resulted in legislative changes.

Improving the transparency, accessibility, and effectiveness of the European Citizens' Initiative is essential to address these challenges and enhance citizens' trust in the European project. The recent revision of the ECI Regulation, which came into force in 2020, introduced several improvements, including simplified procedures, more accessible online tools, and increased support for organizers. These measures are a promising step towards a more inclusive and participatory Europe based on citizens' rights.

In conclusion, the European Citizens' Initiative is an essential instrument in building a Europe that values and prioritizes its citizens, fostering European democracy, and making the EU more transparent and responsive to citizens' needs. To fully unlock its potential, further efforts are needed in raising awareness, simplifying procedures, and ensuring the effective implementation of successful initiatives. Embracing and promoting the European Citizens' Initiative will contribute to a more united Europe, empowered by active citizenship and rooted in the fundamental rights of its people.
