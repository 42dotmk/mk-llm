During that long period the function of scarabs repeatedly changed. Primarily amulets, they were also inscribed for use as personal or administrative seals or were incorporated into jewelry.

This new version of the song was included on the 1986 US EP Action Replay as well as the CD version of Jones's 1986 studio album, One to One.
