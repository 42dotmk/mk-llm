The most logical next event in making lemon mousse is to prepare the lemon mixture. Here's a step-by-step process, continuing from where you left off:

1. Add sugar to the bowl with the whole eggs and egg yolks: Measure approximately 150g of granulated sugar and add it to the heat-proof bowl containing the whole eggs and egg yolks. 

2. Whisk the egg mixture: Using a hand whisk or an electric mixer, whisk the egg and sugar mixture until it is pale, thick, and creamy. This may take a few minutes, depending on the equipment used. The mixture should have a ribbon-like consistency when the whisk is lifted.

3. Add lemon zest and juice: Zest 2-3 fresh lemons, depending on their size, into the egg and sugar mixture. Then cut the lemons and squeeze approximately 160ml of lemon juice, adding it to the mixture as well. Gently whisk the ingredients together until combined.

4. Prepare the double boiler: Place the bowl with the egg, sugar, and lemon mixture over a saucepan filled with simmering water, making sure that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. The steam from the simmering water will warm the mixture, allowing it to cook gently without scrambling the eggs.

5. Cook the lemon custard: Stir the mixture constantly with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula while it's over the double boiler. This will ensure even cooking and prevent the mixture from sticking to the bowl. Continue to cook until the mixture thickens and reaches a custard-like consistency. The thickening process may take approximately 10-15 minutes. Once the desired thickness is reached, remove the bowl from the heat.

6. Melt the gelatin: While the lemon custard is cooling, prepare the gelatin. Measure approximately 8g of unflavored gelatin and dissolve it in 60ml of cold water. Once it's softened, gently heat the gelatin mixture in the microwave for a few seconds or using a small saucepan until it becomes liquid. Do not overheat the gelatin, as this may affect its ability to set the mousse later on.

7. Combine the custard and gelatin: Once both mixtures have cooled for a few minutes, add the liquid gelatin to your lemon custard. Mix it thoroughly to ensure that the mixtures are fully combined.

8. Whip the cream: In a separate bowl, whip approximately 350ml of heavy whipping cream until it forms soft peaks. Be careful not to over-whip the cream, as this can cause the mousse to become grainy.

9. Fold the cream into the custard mixture: Once the custard has cooled to room temperature, gently fold the whipped cream into the lemon mixture by using a spatula or a large spoon. Be careful not to deflate the mixture while folding.

10. Whip the egg whites: Retrieve the egg whites stored in the refrigerator and whip them using a clean electric mixer or a hand whisk until they form stiff peaks. It is essential to ensure that the bowl and whisk are completely free of grease or moisture, as this can prevent the egg whites from whipping properly.

11. Fold the egg whites into the mousse: Gently fold the whipped egg whites into the lemon mousse mixture using a spatula or a large spoon, being careful not to deflate the mixture.

12. Transfer the mixture to serving dishes: Once all the components are well combined, scoop or pipe the lemon mousse into individual serving glasses, cups, or a large serving bowl.

13. Refrigerate the lemon mousse: Cover the servings with plastic wrap and refrigerate them for at least 4 hours, or ideally overnight. This step is necessary for allowing the mousse to set properly.

14. Garnish and serve: Once the mousse is set, garnish it with lemon zest, whipped cream, or fresh berries before serving. Enjoy your delicious homemade lemon mousse!
