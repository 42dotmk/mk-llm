News article: Egyptâs Chaotic Election

Egypt’s democratic transition is in turmoil again as the country heads into next month’s crucial election for its first president since the ouster of Hosni Mubarak. Egypt’s military-run government is running out of time to guarantee a fair and credible vote. Authorities need to finalize the list of candidates and decide where polling stations will be located, whether citizens must vote at specific stations, what rules the monitors must follow and how television airtime will be apportioned among candidates. And all this information needs to be widely publicized.

The parliamentary elections in February had problems but were still good enough that the Egyptians see the new legislature as legitimate. The standard should be higher for the presidential election.

The presidential election commission sowed confusion and doubt when it disqualified 10 of 23 candidates for president, including Omar Suleiman, a secularist who was Mr. Mubarak’s former spy chief; Khairat el-Shater, a chief strategist of the Muslim Brotherhood; and Hazem Salah Abu Ismail, an ultraconservative Salafi preacher. All three were considered front-runners — and polarizing figures — and were ruled off the ballot on technical grounds. We don’t pretend to know all of the forces at work here. Both the military and the Islamists, who have been battling for control, lost their top candidates. But the disqualifications have fed conspiracy theories and added to doubts about the legitimacy of the entire process.

So who’s left? The disqualifications were a boost for Amr Moussa, a secularist and former foreign minister, and Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, a liberal Islamist reformer. They are seen as the leading candidates along with Mohamed Morsi, the Brotherhood’s current choice.

The Brotherhood has the strongest organization. But Mr. Morsi is not as well known or as influential as Mr. Shater. His election would also give the Islamists control of both the presidency and Parliament, and his conservative religious vision rightly makes many Egyptians, as well as the West, uneasy. He has called for barring women and non-Muslims from the presidency on the basis of Islamic law, or Shariah, and he has made inflammatory statements about Israel, describing its citizens as “killers and vampires.” The two other leading candidates offer less ideological and more practical approaches that seek to appeal to a broad range of Egyptians. Mr. Moussa, a former Arab League secretary general with wide name recognition, has pledged to eradicate illiteracy, create jobs, attract international aid and “care for the marginalized and the weak.” His links to Mr. Mubarak could hurt him.

Mr. Aboul Fotouh is charismatic and is seen as a pious man, but not an extremist. He was expelled from the Brotherhood last year for advocating a more tolerant and inclusive approach to Islam and Egypt.

The military has wasted the last year, deferring decisions or making bad ones. Economic problems are particularly acute: debt is mounting; currency reserves could soon be depleted; unemployment has skyrocketed. A new constitutional assembly needs to be appointed (the court threw out the first group) to rewrite the repressive Mubarak Constitution, and Egyptians will need to approve it. The process is already causing fierce jockeying over how much power the military and the president will have.

Egyptians need to know that whoever wins the presidency will bring a skilled team with a viable plan to create jobs, improve education, woo foreign investment and guarantee the rights of all Egyptians. The first step must be a credible vote.
