Question 2:
As for the new series of Dragon Ball, it is not clear if it will be accepted or not. The reception of the new series will depend on various factors, such as the quality of the story, the animation, and how it connects with the previous series.

In terms of whether the answer to these two questions would be the same, they are not directly related; thus, the answer is no. The first question is about the chronological order of the Dragon Ball TV series and movies, while the second question concerns the reception of a new series. They are independent inquiries, and the answers to both questions are not intrinsically linked.
