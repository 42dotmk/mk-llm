The two questions seem similar at first glance, but they actually inquire about different aspects of the nature of space and the presence of particles within it. To provide a comprehensive understanding, we will address both questions individually and compare them in the end.

Question 1: Does 'empty' space have mass which is displaced by the particles of matter which exist in it and move through it?

The current understanding of space is deeply rooted in the framework of General Relativity, which was introduced by Albert Einstein in 1915. According to this theory, space and time are combined into a continuum known as spacetime, and matter and energy curve spacetime, causing the effects we perceive as gravity. It is essential to understand that 'empty' space is not a substance or an object with mass that can be displaced by other matter. The very presence of matter dictates the geometry of spacetime, and it determines the paths of motion for objects within the vicinity.

In recent decades, research has suggested that 'empty' space is not entirely empty. The concept of vacuum energy associated with quantum field theory tells us that even in the absence of particles, fields (such as electromagnetic fields and other fundamental fields) still exist in space. These fields contain energy, which contributes to the overall massâ€“energy equivalence through Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2. However, vacuum energy is distinct from the presence of a substance with mass that can be displaced by other particles.

Question 2: Is 'empty' space filled with massive particles which are displaced by the particles of matter which exist in it and move through it?

This question seems to inquire about the potential presence of particles within 'empty' space that could be displaced by other particles of matter. As mentioned earlier, physicists have discovered that space can not be considered as truly "empty," given the quantum field theory's explanations. It is primarily assumed that there are usually no massive particles (particles with mass) occupying such a hypothetical 'empty' space, at least in a classical sense.

However, particles can spontaneously appear and disappear at the quantum scale within a vacuum due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. This principle states that we cannot know the exact position and momentum (mass times velocity) of a particle simultaneously. In extreme cases, the uncertainty principle allows for particles-antiparticles pairs to be created and annihilated within a short time duration. Although these appear in the quantum vacuum, they are not considered to be "displaced" by other particles, as their appearance and disappearance are fleeting and unrelated to the motion or presence of conventional matter.

Comparison:

In summary, these two questions probe different aspects of the nature of 'empty' space. The first question focuses on whether empty space has mass, and the answer is that it does not have mass in a conventional sense, but quantum theories reveal the presence of energy in 'empty' space due to fields suffused throughout it. The second question highlights whether there are massive particles in empty space that are displaced by other particles. Although empty space is not filled with massive particles in the classical sense, it is worth noting the fleeting appearance and disappearance of particle-antiparticle pairs due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. However, these transient quantum events are not displaced by regular matter.

Overall, both questions touch on the complex concept of space and its contents, with each focusing on different aspects under the broad umbrella of mass, energy, and particles in so-called 'empty' space.
