The two questions you've asked are related, but they are not exactly the same. The first question, "What will happen after I die?" is more specific to the individual asking the question, while the second question, "What happens when we die?" is more general and refers to the human experience as a whole. Both questions deal with the concept of human mortality, but from different perspectives.

Now, let's elaborate on each of the questions.

1) What will happen after I die?

This question pertains to the personal journey of an individual after their physical death, and can be explored from various viewpoints, such as theological, scientific, and philosophical.

A. Theological Perspectives: Different religions have different beliefs about what happens to an individual after they die. Some common ideas include:

- Christianity: Belief in an eternal soul that will be judged and allowed into Heaven or Hell based on their actions during their lifetime.
- Hinduism: The concept of reincarnation, where a person's soul is reborn into a different body based on their Karma (actions) from their past lives.
- Buddhism: Similar to Hinduism, Buddhism also believes in the cycle of death and rebirth known as Samsara, which continues until an individual reaches Enlightenment or Nirvana.

B. Scientific Perspectives: From a scientific standpoint, when a person dies, their physical body ceases to function. The heart stops pumping blood, and the brain's electrical activity ceases. Once a person is declared dead, their body undergoes the process of decomposition, in which it is broken down by natural processes and absorbed back into the ecosystem.

C. Philosophical Perspectives: There are various philosophical viewpoints that address the question of what happens after death. Some philosophers argue that consciousness is an emergent property of the brain, and thus concludes with the death of the individual. Others propose theories such as panpsychism, suggesting that consciousness is a fundamental aspect of the universe, and might continue after death in some form.

2) What happens when we die?

This question addresses the general experience of death from the perspective of humanity as a whole.

A. Theological Perspectives: Similar to the individual experience, cultural beliefs and religious teachings often dictate how people understand what happens when we die. The concepts of an afterlife, reincarnation, and judgement may continue to persist, providing varying perspectives on the human experience of death.

B. Scientific Perspectives: The biological process of death is consistent across all humans. As mentioned earlier, the heart stops beating, the brain activity ceases, and the body eventually decomposes and returns to the ecosystem. Regardless of personal beliefs, the scientific aspects of death remain constant.

C. Societal Perspectives: When a person dies, the impact is not limited to their individual experience; it extends to their family, friends, and community. People come together to mourn, remember, and honor the deceased through funerals, memorials, and other cultural rituals. The memory and legacy of the individual continue through the stories and connections they shared with the living.

In conclusion, both questions revolve around the concept of death, but they are framed differently. One focuses on the individual's experience post-mortem, while the other looks at the general phenomenon of human death. From theological, scientific, philosophical, and societal points of view, the answers can vary greatly. Ultimately, one's understanding of what happens after death largely depends on their personal beliefs and cultural context.
