young pup in politics, just starting my career as a Democratic strategist, I vividly recall watching Robert Novak -- he of the piercing gaze and razor-sharp insights -- on "The McLaughlin Group" and later on "Crossfire." I would take copious notes, trying to anticipate his attack lines and develop counterarguments that might one day be useful in my own political battles.

To say I was intimidated when I first met him would be an understatement. But it didn't take long for me to recognize that beneath that gruff exterior was a man of uncommon intellect, boundless curiosity, and unwavering conviction. Over the years, as we sparred and debated, I discovered that he was also warm, funny, and deeply loyal. And I came to admire his skepticism about authority, his tireless work ethic, and his faith in the power of reason to change minds and hearts.

I disagree with every word Bob ever said and swore to fight his ideas until the end of time. And yet we loved each other. Or at least I loved him, and I believe the feeling was mutual. Here's why: he embodied the true spirit of American democracy. He passionately believed in the marketplace of ideas -- in the notion that the only way our country can achieve greatness is if all sides have a chance to present their best arguments, and if we are all humble enough to listen and learn from each other.

In our increasingly polarized world, where too many political pundits retreat to their respective echo chambers and lob lazy adhominems at their opponents, Bob Novak never took the easy way out. He was always curious about the other side's perspective, always eager to engage with those whose beliefs were vastly different from his own. And because of his fearlessness and intellectual honesty, he earned the respect and admiration of people he fiercely disagreed with -- myself included.

One of the things I respected most about Bob was his unwavering commitment to journalistic integrity. If you doubted this for a moment, you should have seen him in the newsroom -- in reporters' huddles, at editorial meetings, on the phone with sources. He was a dogged, relentless investigator who cared deeply about getting the facts right. He often quarreled with his colleagues -- sometimes loudly -- but he always hewed to an uncompromising code of professional excellence that made him both a formidable adversary and a trusted newsman.

Moreover, Bob Novak was a man of faith. In a business where cynicism often reigns supreme, he was unapologetic about his belief in a higher power, and his willingness to live a life informed by that faith. He converted from Judaism to Catholicism in 1998, and ardently practiced his religion, praying the rosary regularly and attending mass daily when possible. His faith provided him with a moral compass that guided his professional and personal life, and it grounded him in a sense of humility that made him a better man and a better journalist.

In the years since Bob's passing, I find myself missing our passionate debates. The gruff voice and the mischievous glint in his eye. The ability to make me laugh even as he skewered my most cherished beliefs. But what I miss most of all is the example he set -- of a man who cared deeply about our country, its institutions, and its highest ideals, and who fought every day to make America a better place.

In these hyper-partisan times, we could all do well to remember the legacy of Robert Novak: the quintessential American journalist, a combative commentator, and a man of abiding faith. A man unafraid to challenge authority, expose hypocrisy, and celebrate the power of the press to inform, enlighten, and guide our nation's discourse.
