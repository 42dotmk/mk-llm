[Question]A bar of steel weighs twice the mass of a bar of tin. If a steel bar also weighs 20 kgs more than a copper bar and a copper bar weighs 90 kgs, calculate the total weight of a container with 20 bars of each type of metal.
[Answer]The total weight of 20 bars of copper is 20 * 90 = 1800kgs. If a copper bar weighs 90 kgs, and a steel bar weighs 20 kgs more than a copper bar, the weight of a steel bar is 90 + 20 = 110 kgs. If a bar of steel weighs 110 kgs, 20 bars will weigh 20 * 110 = 2200kgs. The total weight of 20 bars of copper and steel is 2200 + 1800 = 4000 kgs. A bar of steel weighs twice the mass of a bar of tin, meaning a bar of tin weighs 110 / 2 = 55 kgs. The total weight of 20 bars of tins is 55 * 20 = 1100 kgs. The total weight of 20 bars of each metal is 4000 + 1100 = 5100 kgs. The answer is 5100.
Q: A soccer team had 24 players prepared for a soccer game. The first half saw 11 players start the game with 2 substitutions made. In the second half, the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half. How many players on the team did not play that day?
A: With two substitutions, 11 + 2 = 13 players from the team played the game in the first half. In the second half, the team made twice the number of substitutions it made in the first half, a total of 2 * 2 = 4 substitutions. The total number of players who played the game is 13 + 4 = 17. If the soccer team had 24 players prepared for the soccer game, the number of players who did not play the game is 24 - 17 = 7 players. The answer is 7.
Question: A frog lays her eggs over a series of 4 days. The first day she lays 50 eggs. The second day, she doubles her production of eggs. The third day she lays 20 more than the second day, and the last day she doubles the first three days total. How many eggs did the frog lay over the span of the 4 days?
Answer: Day 1:50. Day 2:50(2) = 100. Day 3:100 + 20 = 120. Day 4:2(50 + 100 + 120) = 540. Total:50 + 100 + 120 + 540 = 810 eggs. The answer is 810.
[Question]Naomi is doing the wash. First she makes piles of different types, with one pile for towels, one for sheets, and one for clothes that need to be washed on the gentle cycle. The clothes take 30 minutes to wash. The towels take twice as long as the clothes to wash. The sheets take 15 minutes less time to wash than the towels. How many minutes total will it take for Naomi to wash everything?
[Answer]The clothes take 30 minutes to wash and the towels take twice as long, 30 x 2 = 60 minutes to wash the towels. The sheets take 15 minutes less than the towels, 60 - 15 = 45 minutes to wash the sheets. It takes 30 minutes + 60 minutes + 45 minutes = 135 minutes to wash everything. The answer is 135.
Q: Cappuccinos cost $2, iced teas cost $3, cafe lattes cost $1.5 and espressos cost $1 each. Sandy orders some drinks for herself and some friends. She orders three cappuccinos, two iced teas, two cafe lattes, and two espressos. How much change does she receive back for a twenty-dollar bill?
A: Find the total cost of the cappuccinos by multiplying the price by the quantity: 3 cappuccinos x $2 / cappuccino = $6. Then do the same for the iced teas: 2 iced teas x $3 / tea = $6. Then do the same for the cafe lattes: 2 lattes x $1.5 / latte = $3. Then do the same for the espressos: 2 espressos x $1 = $2. In total Sandy pays $6 + $6 + $3 + $2 = $17. Sandy will receive $20 - $17 = $3 in change. The answer is 3.
