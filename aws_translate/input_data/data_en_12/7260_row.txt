Should there be any underlying medical or physical issues contributing to the development of dependent personality disorder, the doctor may recommend appropriate treatments or refer the patient to a specialist for further evaluation.

Seek therapy from a licensed mental health professional.
Once any necessary medical evaluations have been completed, seeking guidance from a mental health professional, like a psychologist or psychiatrist, is the next important step. These professionals are trained to diagnose and treat various mental health disorders, including dependent personality disorder. A mental health professional will work closely with the patient to determine the best course of treatment, such as individual therapy, group therapy, or a combination of both.

Consider cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).
One of the most commonly recommended treatments for dependent personality disorder is cognitive-behavioral therapy. This type of therapy focuses on helping the patient develop healthy thought patterns and positive coping mechanisms to deal with difficult situations and emotions. CBT can help individuals with dependent personality disorder to identify and change negative thoughts, build self-esteem, and develop a stronger sense of autonomy and independence.

Explore psychodynamic therapy.
Another treatment option for dependent personality disorder is psychodynamic therapy. Through this therapeutic approach, the patient will work with the therapist to explore and understand the unconscious thought processes, underlying emotions, and past experiences that may be contributing to their disorder. By gaining insight into the causes of their dependency, the patient can begin to address these issues and develop healthier ways of relating to others and forming relationships.

Attend group therapy.
Group therapy can be a valuable tool for those with dependent personality disorder. In a structured group setting, individuals can learn from others who may be experiencing similar challenges, develop new coping strategies, and practice essential communication and social skills. Additionally, group therapy can provide a supportive environment in which individuals can work on building self-confidence and independence.

Consider medication.
Although there are no specific medications designed for the treatment of dependent personality disorder, some individuals may benefit from taking medications such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs. These medications can help alleviate some of the symptoms associated with DPD, such as overwhelming anxiety or depression. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new medication, as they will be able to prescribe the appropriate dosage and monitor any potential side effects.

Engage in self-help activities.
Besides professional treatment, individuals with dependent personality disorder can benefit from engaging in self-help activities. These can include reading self-help books, attending support groups, or engaging in mindfulness and relaxation techniques. Such activities can aid in building self-awareness and self-confidence and help foster a greater sense of independence and autonomy.

Stay dedicated to recovery.
Treating dependent personality disorder can be a long and challenging process. It is essential for the patient to remain committed to their treatment plan and maintain an open and honest relationship with their mental healthcare team. By actively participating in the recovery process and seeking support from loved ones, the patient can take the necessary steps to overcome the challenges associated with DPD and start living a healthier, more independent life.
