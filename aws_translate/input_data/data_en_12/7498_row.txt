[Question]Corey downloaded two movie series from his Netflix account with 12 and 14 seasons per series, respectively. However, in the week, his computer got a mechanical failure, and he lost two episodes from each season for both series. If each season in the movie series that Corey downloaded had 16 episodes, how many episodes remained after the computer's mechanical failure?
[Answer]In the first movie series with 12 seasons, after the mechanical failure, the number of episodes that Corey lost is 2 * 12 = 24. Originally, the movie series with 12 seasons had 12 * 16 = 192 episodes. After the mechanical failure, Corey had 192 - 24 = 168 episodes remaining in the first movie series. Similarly, the 14 season movie series also had 14 * 2 = 28 lost after the computer's mechanical failure. Originally, the movie series with 14 seasons has 14 * 16 = 224 episodes. The mechanical failure of the computer reduced the number of episodes in the 14 season movie series to 224 - 28 = 196. After the loss, Corey had 196 + 168 = 364 episodes remaining from the two movie series he had downloaded. The answer is 364.
Q: Mandy’s phone data plan charges $30 per month for data. Her first month, she got a promotional rate of one-third the normal price. However, in the fourth month she went over her data limit and was charged an extra fee of $15. How much did Mandy pay in the first 6 months for data?
A: Mandy paid 1 / 3 * 30 = 30 / 3 = $10 for her first month of data. She paid 30 + 15 = $45 for her fourth month of data. Minus those two months, she had 6 - 2 = 4 months of regular charges. Thus, Mandy paid 4 * 30 + 10 + 45 = 120 + 55 = $175 for the first 6 months for data. The answer is 175.
Question: Apollo pulls the sun across the sky every night. Once a month, his fiery chariot’s wheels need to be replaced. He trades golden apples to Hephaestus the blacksmith to get Hephaestus to make him new wheels. Hephaestus raised his rates halfway through the year and now demands twice as many golden apples as before. He charged three golden apples for the first six months. How many golden apples does Apollo have to pay for the entire year of chariot wheels?
Answer: Apollo had to pay 3 * 6 = 18 golden apples for the first six months. For the second six months, he had to pay twice that amount, or 18 * 2 = 36 golden apples. Thus, Apollo had to pay 18 + 36 = 54 golden apples for a year of chariot wheels. The answer is 54.
[Question]If I'm 4 times older than Billy currently, and Billy is 4 years old, how old was I when Billy was born?
[Answer]I would currently be 4 * 4 = 16 years old, since I'm 4 times older than Billy's age of 4. Therefore, in order to find my age at Billy's birth we'd simply subtract Billy's age of 4 from my age, meaning I was 16 - 4 = 12 years old. The answer is 12.
Q: Nalani had two female dogs that were expecting and after a month gave birth to 10 puppies each. She then sold 3/4 of the puppies after they came of age, each at $200. Calculate the total amount of money she received from the sale of the puppies.
A: If the two expectant dogs gave birth to 10 puppies each, the total number of puppies Nalani had is 10 + 10 = 20. When they came of age, Nalani sold 3 / 4 of the dogs, a total of 3 / 4 * 20 = 15 dogs. If each dog sold for $200, Nalani received 15 * 200 = $3000 from the sale of the dogs. The answer is 3000.
