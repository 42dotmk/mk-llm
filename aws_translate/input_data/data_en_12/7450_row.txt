Q: Jill and her brother Jack are going apple picking. Jill's basket can hold twice as much as Jack's basket when both are full. Jack's basket is full when it has 12 apples, but currently space for 4 more. How many times could Jack's current number of apples fit into Jill's basket?
A: Since Jill's basket can hold twice as much as Jack's, and Jack's is capable of holding 12 apples in total, this means Jill's basket can hold 12 * 2 = 24 apples in total. Since Jack has 4 less than the maximum amount of apples he can fit in his basket, this means Jack has 12 - 4 = 8 apples in his basket. Therefore, Jill's basket can hold 24 / 8 = 3 times the amount of apples Jack is currently carrying. The answer is 3.
Question: Jenny is planning her catering budget for her wedding. She's going to have 80 guests. 3 times as many guests want steak as chicken. If each steak entree costs $25 and each chicken entree costs $18, how much is the total catering budget?
Answer: Let s be the number of guests who want steak and c be the number who want chicken. We know that s + c = 80 and s = 3c. Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get 3c + c = 80. Combining like terms, we get 4c = 80. Dividing both sides by 4, we get c = 20. Then multiply the number of guests who want chicken by the cost of each chicken entree: 20 guests * $18 / guest = $360. Then triple the number of guests who want chicken to find the number who want steak: 20 guests * 3 = 60 guests. Then multiply the number of guests who want steak by the cost of each steak entree: 60 guests * $25 / guest = $1500. Then add the cost of the steak and chicken entrees to find the total cost: $1500 + $360 = $1860. The answer is 1860.
[Question]The student council sells scented erasers in the morning before school starts to help raise money for school dances. The local bookstore donated 48 boxes of erasers. There are 24 erasers in each box. If the student council sells the erasers for $0.75 each, how much money will they make?
[Answer]There are 48 boxes x 24 erasers = 1,152 erasers. The student council will make 1,152 erasers x $0.75 = $864. The answer is 864.
Q: A hot dog stand sells 10 hot dogs every hour, each one selling for $2. How many hours does the stand need to run to make $200 in sales?
A: First, we find out how much in sales the stand makes each hour by multiplying the number of hot dogs sold by the sales price, finding that 2 * 10 = 20 dollars in sales each hour. Then we divide the sales goal for the day by the sales per hour, finding that the stand needs to be open for 200 / 20 = 10 hours to hit its sales goal. The answer is 10.
Question: Basil gets 1/2 of a dog cookie in the morning and before bed. She gets 2 whole cookies during the day. Basilâ€™s cookies are packaged with 45 cookies per box. How many boxes will she need to last her for 30 days?
Answer: Basil gets 1 / 2 in the morning and 1 / 2 at bedtime so she gets 1 / 2 + 1 / 2 = 1 whole cookie. Basil also gets 2 whole cookies during the day so all total she gets 2 + 1 = 3 whole cookies. She needs cookies for 30 days and eats 3 a day so she needs 30 * 3 = 90 cookies. Her cookies come 45 per box and she needs 90 cookies so she needs 90 / 45 = 2 boxes of cookies. The answer is 2.
Q: When Pogo, the four-legged martian, walks across the soft Martian soil, it leaves 4 footprints every meter.
