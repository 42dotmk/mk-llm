The 1993 science fiction horror-themed first-person shooter video game that surpassed Corridor 7: Alien Invasion in terms of popularity, influence, and impact in the gaming industry is Doom, developed and published by id Software. Doom was released on December 10, 1993, for the MS-DOS platform, and it quickly transformed the gaming landscape with its groundbreaking and innovative features.

Doom's success can be attributed to a variety of factors that set it apart from its competitors, including Corridor 7: Alien Invasion. Some of the most important aspects that contributed to Doom's supremacy are:

1. Graphics and Technologies:
Doom introduced revolutionary graphics and a pseudo-3D game engine called the id Tech 1 engine, also known as the Doom engine. This was a massive leap forward in video game graphics technologies, allowing for complex levels with varying heights, dynamic lighting, and the ability to use textures on all surfaces, which contributed to a more immersive and visually-appealing experience than Corridor 7: Alien Invasion.

2. Gameplay and Level Design:
The gameplay in Doom was fast-paced, intense, and action-packed, offering a more engaging experience for players. With diverse and non-linear level design, players were encouraged to explore and locate secret areas, items, and weapons, ushering in a new era of replayability and discovery. On the other hand, Corridor 7: Alien Invasion featured a slower-paced gameplay style and more linear level design, which did not resonate with players as much as Doom's dynamic approach.

3. Weapons and Enemies:
Doom provided players with a plethora of iconic and powerful weapons, like the shotgun, chaingun, and BFG 9000. This arsenal allowed players to respond to various enemy types and situations effectively. The game was also famous for its diverse and menacing roster of enemies, featuring various demons and monsters, each with unique attacks and behaviors. In comparison, although Corridor 7: Alien Invasion had a decent selection of weapons and enemies, it failed to match Doom's depth and variety in this regard.

4. Atmosphere and Sound Design:
Doom's dark and oppressive atmosphere was created through the combination of its visuals, level design, and intense music and sound effects. The game effectively used lighting and texture work to immerse players in an unsettling and atmospheric experience. The effective use of sound, including memorable music scores by composer Bobby Prince, contributed to the game's dark, adrenaline-pumping aura. Corridor 7: Alien Invasion, while similarly dark in theme, did not manage to create the same level of immersion and atmospheric impact as Doom.

5. Modding and Customization:
Doom had a profound impact on the modding community, as id Software released the game's source code and encouraged players to create custom content. This led to the birth of the WAD file format, which allowed users to create new levels and modifications. The result was an endless stream of additional content and creative ideas that extended Doom's life beyond its initial release and cemented its status as an iconic title. Corridor 7: Alien Invasion lacked such an extensive modding community, which negatively impacted its longevity in comparison to Doom.

In conclusion, Doom surpassed Corridor 7: Alien Invasion in 1993 due to its groundbreaking technology, engaging gameplay, diverse weapon and enemy selection, immersive atmosphere, and its impact on the modding community. It is considered one of the most influential and essential video games in history for these reasons, while Corridor 7: Alien Invasion, although ambitious, failed to achieve a similar level of significance in the gaming world.
