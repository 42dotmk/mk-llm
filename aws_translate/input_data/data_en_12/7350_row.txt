Plot:

In a small town nestled in the countryside, the story revolves around 25-year-old Tony, a mechanical genius and budding inventor. He is well-known in the local community for his skill in fixing old broken machinery and his love for antique items. Tony, however, fears the passage of time and wishes to turn back the clock to relive the glory days of his youth when his parents were still alive.

The movie opens with Tony blowing out candles on his 25th birthday cake, surrounded by friends and family, but his eyes are lost in thought, reminiscing about the past. An old friend, Sarah, notices his distant demeanor and offers to listen, providing comfort and understanding on how he feels about turning 25.

Determined to change the course of his life, Tony decides to break away from the monotony of adulthood and embarks on an ambitious journey to invent a time machine. He puts his heart and soul into the project, often becoming isolated in his workshop for days on end, with only Sarah regularly checking on him. As rumors of Tony's strange invention spread throughout the town, it catches the attention of a mysterious and wealthy investor, Mr. Grayson, who offers financial support and resources for his project.

As the story progresses, Tony and Sarah's relationship deepens, and she finds herself torn between being supportive and worrying about Tony's obsession with turning back time. Tony, fully aware of Sarah's concerns, promises her that he will never forget their time together, no matter how far back he goes.

Finally, after months of laboring, Tony's invention comes to fruition. He successfully creates a machine capable of traveling through time. However, during its test run, unforeseen consequences arise. The machine's energy destabilizes the fabric of time, causing anomalies and ripples throughout history. Faced with the repercussions of tampering with time, Tony panics and accidentally sends himself back to the age of 17.

As a younger-version of himself, Tony desperately attempts to stabilize time and prevent further damage. He realizes the importance of living in the present, understanding that the good memories will stay with him, but that is not where life always exists. Along the way, he encounters his childhood friend, Jonathan, who had died in an accident. Through his interactions with him, Tony slowly begins to understand the impact of trying to change the past and the powerful role of fate.

Seeing his parents alive and happy stirs up mixed emotions for Tony, but he becomes more determined to return to his 25-year-old reality, to the people he loves, especially Sarah. His constant wistfulness for the past has compromised his cherished relationships, and he now understands that he must embrace the present and the future.

Using his advanced knowledge of the time machine, Tony successfully fixes the anomalies and travels back to the exact moment of his 25th birthday party. He is greeted by his friends and family, who have no recollection of the events that had transpired, but only Sarah, who somehow remembers everything. With her warm embrace, Tony resolves to make the most of his life from now on and discards the time machine, focusing on building a life together with Sarah.

Chasing Time is a tale about self-discovery and self-acceptance. Set against the backdrop of inventive science fiction elements, the film explores the notion of living in the moment and learning to appreciate the value of relationships and the passage of time. It serves as a poignant reminder to cherish the present and continue moving forward, no matter how much we may yearn for the past.
