[Question]John started weightlifting when he was 16. When he first started he could Clean & Jerk 80 kg and he could Snatch 50 kg. He manages to double his clean and jerk and increase his snatch by 80%. What is his new combined total lifting capacity?
[Answer]His clean and jerk goes to 80 * 2 = 160 kg. His snatch increases by 50 * .8 = 40 kg. So his snatch is now 50 + 40 = 90 kg. So his total is 160 + 90 = 250 kg. The answer is 250.
Q: Four adults with 32 teeth went to the dentist for a checkup after realizing they were having severe tooth pain. They were found to have different numbers of damaged teeth, and each person had some teeth removed. The first person had 1/4 of all his teeth removed, and the second person had 3/8 of his teeth removed, the third person had half of his teeth removed, while the last person only had 4 teeth removed. What's the total number of teeth removed at the dental clinic?
A: The first person had 1 / 4 of all his teeth removed, a total of 1 / 4 * 32 = 8 teeth. The second person had 3 / 8 of his teeth removed, meaning 3 / 8 * 32 = 12 of his teeth were removed. Together, the first and the second person had 12 + 8 = 20 teeth removed in total. The third person had half of his teeth removed, which were 1 / 2 * 32 = 16 teeth. The first three people had a total of 20 + 16 = 36 teeth removed from their mouth. The last person only had 4 teeth removed, bringing the total number of teeth removed at the dentist clinic to be 36 + 4 = 40 teeth. The answer is 40.
Question: Edith is a receptionist at a local office and is organizing files into cabinets. She had 60 files and finished organizing half of them this morning. She has another 15 files to organize in the afternoon and the rest of the files are missing. How many files are missing?
Answer: Edith has already organized 60 files / 2 = 30 files in the morning. She has files left to organize so she must still have 30 + 15 = 45 files in the office. This means there are 60 total files – 45 organized files = 15 missing files. The answer is 15.
[Question]Marcus spends 20 minutes giving his dog a bath and half as long blow-drying her. Then he takes her for a walk along a 3-mile trail. If Marcus walks at 6 miles per hour, how much time does he spend with his dog total?
[Answer]First find the total amount of time Marcus spends blow - drying his dog: 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes. Then find the time Marcus spends walking: 3 miles / 6 miles / hour = .5 hours. Then convert that time to minutes: .5 hours * 60 minutes / hour = 30 minutes. Then add up the time Marcus spends washing, drying and walking to find the total time: 10 minutes + 20 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes. The answer is 60.
Q: There were 50 candies left in a bowl after Shelly ate 20 candies the previous week. Her friend comes over, bringing twice as much candy as she originally had. Shelly adds this to the bowl and they decide to divide them equally. How much candy did her friend have after eating 10 of her candies?
A: The total number of candies Shelley had before eating some is 50 + 20 = 70 candies. When her friend came over, she brought 2 * 70 = 140 candies. The total number of candies in the bowl is now 140 + 50 = 190 candies. When they divide this equally between them, each gets 190 / 2 = 95 candies. When Shelly’s friend eats 10 of her candies, she still has 95 - 10 = 85 candies. The answer is 85.
