Q: Harris feeds his dog 1 large organic carrot over the course of 1 day. There are 5 carrots in a 1 pound bag and each bag costs $2.00. In one year, how much will Harris spend on carrots?
A: His dog gets 1 carrot a day and there are 365 days in a year, so his dog eats 1 * 365 = 365 carrots. There are 5 carrots per bag and he will need 365 carrots, so that's 365 / 5 = 73 bags of carrots. The bags cost $2.00 and he will need 73 bags so that's $2 * 73 = $146.00 worth of organic carrots. The answer is 146.
Question: Jerry has a bunch of half-empty soda cans on his desk. He needs to drain all of them and put them in the recycling bin. He can carry four cans at once, and it takes him 30 seconds to drain those 4 cans. It takes him ten seconds each way to walk to the sink and recycling bin and then back to his desk. If there are 28 cans on Jerry's desk, how long does it take him to throw all of them away?
Answer: Jerry has to walk to the sink / recycling bin 28 cans / 4 cans per trip = 7 trips. The round trip takes 10 seconds per way * 2 ways = 20 seconds. Counting the time he spent pouring out the cans and the time the round trip took, he spent 20 seconds per trip + 30 seconds per trip = 50 seconds per trip. With 7 round trips, he spent 50 seconds per trip * 7 trips = 350 seconds. The answer is 350.
[Question]The GooGoo brand of clothing manufactures two types of shirts, one with 3 buttons and the other with 5 buttons. A large department store ordered GooGoo to manufacture 200 of each type of shirt. How many buttons will the GooGoo brand use to manufacturer all of the shirts for this order?
[Answer]To make 200 of the first type of shirt, they will need 200 * 3 = 600 buttons. To make 200 of the second type of shirt, they will need 200 * 5 = 1000 buttons. To manufacture 200 each of both types of shirts, they will need to use 600 + 1000 = 1600 buttons. The answer is 1600.
Q: MIlle is making snack packs for her kindergarten class. She's going to divide 64 pretzels, four times as many goldfish, and 32 suckers into baggies for the 16 kids in the class. How many items does each baggie have?
A: First find the total number of goldfish Millie adds: 64 pretzels * 4 goldfish / pretzel = 256 goldfish. Then add the number of each kind of snack to find the total: 256 goldfish + 64 pretzels + 32 suckers = 352 snacks. Then divide the total number of snacks by the number of baggies to find the number of snacks per baggie: 352 snacks / 16 baggies = 22 snacks / baggie. The answer is 22.
Question: Federal guidelines recommend eating at least 2 cups of vegetables per day. From breakfast on Sunday to the end of the day on Thursday, Sarah has eaten 8 cups. How many cups per day does Sarah need to eat of her vegetables in order to meet her daily minimum requirement for the week?
Answer: There are 7 days in a week and 2 cups are recommended per day, bringing the total to 7 days * 2 cups / day = 14 cups for the week. Out of the 14 total cups needed for the week, Sarah has already eaten 8, for a total of 14 cups - 8 cups = 6 cups left to consume for the week. Sunday through Thursday equals 5 days that have passed. If there are 7 days in the week then Sarah has 7 days - 5 days = 2 days left of the week. If she needs to eat 6 more cups in the next 2 days then she will have to eat 6 cups / 2 days = 3 cups per day over the next two days. The answer is 3.
