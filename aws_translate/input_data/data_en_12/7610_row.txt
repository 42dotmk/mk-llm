Title: Michael Van Hise: The Disturbing Case of the Man Denied Bail in Federal Court

Introduction

The recent case of Michael Van Hise has shocked the nation, as the defendant stands accused of attempting to hire a former NYPD officer, Gilberto Valle, to kidnap, rape, and murder a woman. The details of the case have horrified people across America, shining a light on the dark side of human nature and raising questions about online interactions and the line between fantasy and reality. This article delves into the disturbing details of the case and examines the reasons behind the court's decision to deny bail to the accused.

The Accusations against Michael Van Hise

Michael Van Hise has been accused of offering NYPD officer Gilberto Valle $5,000 to kidnap a woman. The intended victim was to be subjected to sexual assault and ultimately murdered by Van Hise. The connection between the two men allegedly came from an online chat on a fetish website, where they discussed their dark desires. In addition to this exposed crime, Van Hise also reportedly engaged in conversations discussing the rape of an infant, further exacerbating the severity of the offenses he is charged with.

The Involvement of Gilberto Valle, the Infamous 'Cannibal Cop'

The involvement of former NYPD officer Gilberto Valle in Van Hise's case ties it to another notorious case that made headlines around the world. Valle, known as the "Cannibal Cop," was convicted in 2013 of conspiracy to kidnap, cook, and eat women. The fact that Van Hise sought the assistance of such a dangerous and infamous individual speaks to the serious intentions behind the accused's actions.

The Defense of Van Hise's Wife

Despite the shocking allegations against him, Michael Van Hise has received support from an unlikely source - his wife, who has publicly defended him as being a "big teddy bear" and claiming her husband is "as hard-core as a baby." There have been some arguments that the interactions between Van Hise and Valle were purely fantasy-based, and the possibility of this being considered a mere thought crime has been the concern for some legal experts.

The Denial of Bail in Federal Court

Given the ghastly nature of the accusations, it comes as no surprise that the court has decided to deny bail to Michael Van Hise. The court likely considered the potential risks to public safety if the accused was released on bail. Furthermore, the association with a known convicted criminal, such as the "Cannibal Cop," also raises concerns about the possible connections to previously undisclosed criminal activities.

The Ongoing Debate about Online Interactions

The case of Michael Van Hise brings about a concerning discussion on the nature of online interactions and the line between fantasy and reality. While the internet allows people to engage in conversations they may never have in real life, it's crucial to recognize when a conversation escalates into criminal territory. The details of this case serve as a stark reminder that fantasies, when combined with violent intentions and the willingness to act on them, can have life-altering consequences for both the offenders and their victims.

Conclusion

The case of Michael Van Hise is an unsettling reminder of the darkness that can lurk within seemingly ordinary individuals. The gravity of the charges, alongside his connections to the infamous 'Cannibal Cop', leaves little wonder why the court denied bail. As the case moves through the judicial system, society must reflect on the consequences of online interactions, and when fantasy reaches criminal levels. The outcome of Michael Van Hise's trial is eagerly awaited, as it may potentially set precedents for similar cases in the future.
