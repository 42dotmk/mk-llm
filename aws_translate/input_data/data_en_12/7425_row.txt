A Stroll Through the Sands of Time:

Malta's rich past is what sets it apart from other idyllic vacation spots. Our readers recommend starting your journey in the fortified capital city of Valletta, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

A must-see is the breathtaking St. John's Co-Cathedral - home to Caravaggio's masterpiece, "The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist."

Also on the must-visit list are the ancient fortified cities of Mdina and Rabat. Known as the "Silent City," Mdina transports you to a bygone era, with its palazzos, convents, and courtyards. Don't miss the stunning views from Bastion Square, or the chance to sample the delectable pastizzi at Crystal Palace in Rabat.

Moreover, delve into the island's prehistoric past by visiting the Hagar Qim temples or the Hal Saflieni Hypogeum, both extraordinary testaments to Malta's Neolithic inhabitants.
