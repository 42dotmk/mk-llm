Question: In my school, the number of students has increased by 20% this year. The number of students this year is 960. How many students were there last year?
Answer: Let X be the number of students last year. The number of students this year is X + X * 20% = 960. Combining like terms, we get X * 1.2 = 960. Dividing both sides by 1.2, we get X = 800 students. The answer is 800.
[Question]Each of the three Morales sisters owns an orange grove that has 110 trees. Each orange tree produces medium-sized oranges. At harvest time, Gabriela's grove produced 600 oranges per tree, while Alba harvested 400 per tree. Each of Maricela's trees produced 500 oranges. With such a huge harvest, the sisters are thinking of making orange juice for sale. If it takes three medium-sized oranges to make 1 cup of juice, and then they sell each cup for $4, how much money will they make?
[Answer]Gabriela's grove produced 600 oranges / tree * 110 trees = 66000 oranges. Alba’s grove produced 400 oranges / tree * 110 trees = 44000 oranges. Maricela's trees produced 500 oranges / tree * 110 trees = 55000 oranges. The Morales sisters therefore harvested a total of 66000 oranges + 44000 oranges + 55000 oranges = 165000 oranges. The oranges will therefore yield 165000 oranges / 3 oranges / cup = 55000 cups of juice. Total sales will be 55000 cups * $4 / cup = $220000. The answer is 220000.
Q: Tracy has a charity book collection store from which she receives book donations from members of her town. Any person who wants to borrow a book is free to do so as long as they return the book after they've finished reading. She has already received 300 book donations. If ten people come and donate five books each in a week, and a total of 140 books are borrowed by other people to read, calculate the total number of books she has remaining in the store?
A: The ten people donated 10 * 5 = 50 books. The total number of books in her store after the new donations is 300 + 50 = 350 books. When some of the books are borrowed, her total collection becomes 350 - 140 = 210 books. The answer is 210.
Question: Anna, Alison, and Jeff collect stamps. Anna had 37 stamps in her collection, Alison had 28 stamps in her collection, and Jeff had 31 stamps in his collection. Alison gave Anna half of her collection in exchange for a novel, and then Anna traded Jeff two bluebird stamps for one mountain stamp. How many stamps did Anna have in the end?
Answer: Alison gave Anna 1 / 2 * 28 = 28 / 2 = 14 stamps. Adding Alison’s stamps to Anna’s collection means Anna has 14 + 37 = 51 stamps. Then Anna traded Jeff 2 stamps, so she had 51 - 2 = 49 stamps. Anna got 1 stamp back in the trade, so she had 49 + 1 = 50 stamps in the end. The answer is 50.
[Question]The number of coronavirus cases in a certain country was 300 infections per day during the first wave. However, the number of cases increased by four times more per day as a new coronavirus variant started infecting people in a second wave. What was the total number of infections during the second wave in 2 weeks?
[Answer]When the number of cases increased by four times more per day during the second wave, there were 4 * 300 = 1200 more infections per day than during the first wave. The total number of infections during the second wave per day was 1200 + 300 = 1500. For two weeks with 14 days, the number of me infections was 14 * 1500 = 21000. The answer is 21000.
