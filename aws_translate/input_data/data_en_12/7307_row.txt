Reasoning and answer: They need 730 inches of rain a year to average 2 inches a day because 365 x 2 = 730. They need 300 more inches because 730 - 430 = 300. They need 3 inches a day because 300 / 100 = 3.
The answer: 3

Between the trolley driver and his first 10 customers, there are 1 + 10 = 11 people are currently on the trolley. On his first stop, 10 people go on and twice as many people got on at the second stop so 10 * 2 = 20 people got on at the second stop. So at the second stop he had 11 people on board, 3 got off and 20 got on so he now has 11 - 3 + 20 = 28 people. At his third stop 18 people got off and 2 got on so in total there are 28 - 18 + 2 = 12 people on the trolley.
The answer: 12
Reverse engineering the question: A trolley driver picked up 10 people on his 1st stop. On the next stop, 3 people got off and twice as many people from the 1st stop got on. On the third stop, 18 people got off and 2 got on. How many people are currently on the trolley?

Reasoning and answer: Let d be the number of drunk drivers and s be the number of speeders. We know that d + s = 45 and s = 7d - 3. Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get d + 7d - 3 = 45. Combining like terms, we get 8d - 3 = 45. Adding 4 to both sides, we get 8d = 48. Dividing both sides by 8, we get d = 6.
The answer: 6

He catches 8 * 12 = 96 crabs a day. So he makes 96 * 5 = $480 per day. That means he makes 7 * 480 = $3360 a day.
The answer: 3360
Reverse engineering the question: Tom catches crabs for a living. He has 8 crab buckets that he checks every day. Each crab bucket gets 12 crabs. He sells each of these crabs for $5 each. How much money does he make per week?

Reasoning and answer: First figure out how much Nancy has to pay after her parents pay their half by dividing the tuition by 2: $22,000 / 2 = $11,000. Then figure out how much Nancy's student loan is by multiplying her scholarship amount by 2: $3,000 * 2 = $6,000. Now subtract the amounts of Nancy's scholarship and loan to find out how much tuition she has to pay by working: $11,000 - $3,000 - $6,000 = $2,000. Now divide the remaining unpaid tuition by the number of hours Nancy works to find out how much she needs to make per hour: $2,000 / 200 hours = $10 / hour.
The answer: 10

Question: Nancy wants to figure out if she can afford to apply to the University of Michigan. The tuition costs $22,000 per semester. Her parents can pay half the cost, and each semester Nancy can get a scholarship for $3,000 and a student loan for twice her scholarship amount. If Nancy can work a total of 200 hours during the semester, how many dollars does she have to make per hour to pay the rest of the tuition?

Reasoning and answer: The total percentage of money that Reese spent in February and March is 20% + 40% = 60%. This means the April expenses and the money left in her account make up 100% - 60% = 40% of her savings. Reese had $2900 + $1500 = $4400 for the April expenses and the money left in her account. So, $4400 is equal to 40% which means every 1% is equal to $4400 / 40 = $110. Therefore, Reese originally had $110 x 100 = $11000 in her savings account.
The answer: 11000
