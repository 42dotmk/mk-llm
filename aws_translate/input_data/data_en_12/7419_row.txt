Q: In a survey about the student's favorite sports, 40% said they like basketball, 10% like chess, 28% like soccer, and the rest said they like badminton. If 250 students were interviewed, how many students identified chess or basketball as their favorite sport?
A: The total percentage of students who said they like chess or basketball is 10% + 40% = 50%. So, 250 x 50 / 100 = 125 students like chess or basketball. The answer is 125.
Question: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur. His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle. Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?
Answer: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400 / 20 = 20 trips using his transport vehicle. Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60 / 60 = 1 hour to travel one - way. Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2 * 1 = 2 hours. Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20 * 2 = 40 hours of driving time. The answer is 40.
[Question]Bill decides to bring donuts to work for a meeting that day. He buys a box of donuts that has 50 in total in them. He eats 2 on the ride in because he's hungry. When he gets to the office, the secretary takes another 4 out of the box when he's not looking. Lastly, right before the meeting Bill sets the box down on his desk and leaves the office to take a phone call. While Bill's away, his coworkers steal half the remaining donuts. Bill comes back and brings the box into his meeting. How many donuts are left in the box?
[Answer]Bill eats 2 donuts out of a box of 50 for 50 - 2 = 48 donuts remaining. The secretary takes 4 more donuts out of the box, leaving 44 donuts remaining. Bills coworkers take half of the remaining donuts, leaving 44 / 2 = 22 donuts remaining. The answer is 22.
Q: There are 50 apples and 40 oranges in the cafeteria. If an apple costs $0.80 and an orange costs $0.50, how much does the cafeteria earn for apples and oranges if there are only 10 apples and 6 oranges left?
A: Counting the remaining 10 apples. There were 50 - 10 = 40 apples sold. Counting the remaining 6 oranges. There were 40 - 6 = 34 oranges sold. The amount of sales for the apples is $0.8 x 40 = $32. The amount of sales for the oranges is $0.5 x 34 = $17. The cafeteria's total earnings are $32 + $17 = $49. The answer is 49.
Question: Three planes are going to the same place but each has a different number of passengers. The first plane has 50, the second had 60, and the third has 40. An empty plane can go 600 MPH, but each passenger makes it go 2 MPH slower. What is their average speed?
Answer: The first plane goes 100 MPH slower than empty because 50 x 2 = 100. The first plane goes 500 MPH because 600 - 100 = 500. The second plane goes 120 MPH slower because 60 x 2 = 120. The second plane goes 480 because 600 - 120 = 480. The third plane goes 80 MPH slower because 40 x 2 = 80. The third plane goes 520 MPH because 600 - 80 = 520. The total speed is 1500 because 500 + 480 + 520 = 1500. Their average speed is 500 because 1500 / 3 = 500. The answer is 500.
