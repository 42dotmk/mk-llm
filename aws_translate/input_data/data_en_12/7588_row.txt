All Negro Comics was an American comic book series created in 1947, which holds great historical significance for being the first known comic book written and drawn exclusively by African American writers and artists. This groundbreaking publication aimed to challenge the racial stereotypes and prejudices that were prevalent in the mainstream comic industry during the mid-20th century. The mastermind behind All Negro Comics was Orrin Cromwell Evans, a visionary journalist and civil rights activist who sought to provide a strong, positive representation of Black characters within comic books.

Orrin Cromwell Evans was a prominent journalist and a pioneer in the African American press. He had extensive experience working for Black-owned newspapers, such as the Philadelphia Tribune and the Pittsburgh Courier. Inspired by the need for representation and the powerful medium of comic books, Evans decided to create All Negro Comics Inc., which would publish comic books by and for African Americans.

Collaborating with a team of talented African American writers and artists, including his brother George J. Evans Jr. (letterer), John Terrell (artist), and Bill Driskell (inker), Evans published the first and only issue of All Negro Comics in June 1947. Due to its historical significance, this singular issue has become a valuable collector's item in the comic book industry.

All Negro Comics featured a diverse range of stories and characters designed to appeal to various readers:

1. "Ace Harlem" - Written and drawn by John Terrell, this was the lead story of the comic book, featuring Ace Harlem, a skilled African American detective who fought crime and solved mysteries in his fictional Harlem neighborhood.

2. "The Little Dew Dillies" - A comedic tale written and drawn by Bill Driskell, this story centered around a group of child-like creatures in a magical forest who demonstrated the importance of friendship, decision-making, and learning from life's lessons.

3. "Hep Chicks on Parade" - This humorous feature, also created by Bill Driskell, portrayed fashionable, witty African American women who were unapologetic about their style and individuality.

4. "Lil' Eggie" - A single-page comic drawn by Dan Lundy, telling the misadventures of a young boy named Eggie and the life lessons he learned along the way.

5. "Sugarfoot" - A story written and illustrated by E.G. Lattimer, focusing on two African American musicians, Sugarfoot and Snake Oil, who used their wits and talents to overcome various challenges.

6. "Lion Man" - Written by Evans himself and drawn by George J. Evans Jr., this story introduced an African superhero named Lion Man, an educated scientist who fought evil forces to protect the African continent and its people.

Despite the innovative spirit behind All Negro Comics, the series faced numerous challenges, including the difficulty of acquiring distribution channels and the rising costs of publishing. The initial print run of 15,000 copies, though successful, could not sustain the project in the long term. Due to these challenges and a possible boycott by some distributors, Evans was unable to secure funding for a second issue, leading to the end of All Negro Comics.

Nevertheless, All Negro Comics left a lasting impression on the comic book industry and opened doors for future generations of African American creators. It marked the beginning of representation and diversity in American comic books, paving the way for prominent Black characters and creators to make their mark in the comic world. This publication remains an important symbol of African American struggle and resilience in the fight for equal representation and opportunities in media and popular culture.
