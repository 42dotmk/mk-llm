potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) with diameters larger than 330 feet (100 meters) that could pose a significant threat to Earth. These PHAs have orbits around the Sun that come within 4.7 million miles (7.5 million kilometers) of Earth's orbit and pose a potential risk of impacting our planet. The estimated number of 47,000 potentially hazardous asteroids mentioned in the question refers to the overall number of near-Earth asteroids, which includes both larger and smaller objects.

The countries most likely to be worst hit by an asteroid impact are those with a large population and high infrastructure density, and those situated in vulnerable geographic locations. Based on these factors, countries such as the United States, China, India, Japan, and countries in Europe are at a higher risk of catastrophic damage and loss of life from an asteroid impact.

The immediate effects of an asteroid impact would depend on the size, composition, and speed of the asteroid, as well as the location of the impact on Earth. An asteroid impact on a city-sized scale could result in:

1. Immediate destruction of buildings and infrastructure: The force of the impact would cause buildings to collapse, roads to be destroyed, and essential services like power, water, and sewage systems to be rendered inoperable. The affected area could extend for many miles beyond the impact site.

2. Shockwave and blast wave: The impact of an asteroid would generate an immense shockwave and blast wave, traveling through the air and ground. These waves could cause further destruction by shattering windows, knocking down walls, and toppling trees, potentially extending damage far beyond the initial impact site.

3. Fireball and subsequent fires: The intense heat generated by the impact would create a massive fireball, igniting fires in the surrounding area. These fires could merge, creating a massive firestorm that consumes everything in its path and releases large amounts of smoke and ash into the atmosphere.

4. Tidal waves or tsunamis: If the asteroid impact occurred in or near a body of water, it could generate enormous waves, flooding coastal areas and causing significant damage to life and property.

Long-term consequences of an asteroid impact could include:

1. Disruption of food supplies: The destruction of agricultural land, fisheries, and transportation infrastructure would disrupt food supplies, leading to food shortages and potential famine.

2. Economic collapse: The massive loss of life, infrastructure, and resources would have dire consequences for the global economy, leading to widespread unemployment, economic recession, and potential collapse.

3. Climate change: The release of vast amounts of dust and debris into the atmosphere could lead to significant climate change, with potential effects such as reduced sunlight, lower temperatures, and disrupted weather patterns.

4. Disease and poor sanitation: The destruction of healthcare and sanitation infrastructure, along with the displacement of large populations, could lead to the spread of disease and poor public health conditions.

To mitigate these potential catastrophic effects, international cooperation and initiatives are essential. Governments and space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), have established programs to track and monitor near-Earth objects and develop technologies and strategies for asteroid impact prevention, such as the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) and the Asteroid Impact & Deflection Assessment (AIDA). Public awareness and preparedness are also crucial, as well as investment in research, development, and infrastructure to minimize human and economic losses.
