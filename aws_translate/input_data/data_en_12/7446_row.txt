[Question]Jose had 400 tabs opened up in his windows browser. After about one hour of browsing, he closed 1/4 of the tabs to allows easy browsing. He read some news from different pages, then closed 2/5 of the remaining tabs. If he closed half of the remaining tabs after further analyzing some pages, how many windows tabs did he have remaining open?
[Answer]When he closed 1 / 4 of the tabs, he closed 1 / 4 * 400 = 100 tabs. The number of windows tabs that remained open is 400 - 100 = 300. After reading some news from different pages, he closed 2 / 5 of the remaining tabs, a total of 2 / 5 * 300 = 120 pages. The number of tabs that remained open is 300 - 120 = 180. If he closed half of the remaining tabs after further analyzing some pages, he closed a total of 1 / 2 * 180 = 90 pages. The total number of tabs that remained opened is 180 - 90 = 90. The answer is 90.
Q: Pat’s computer password is made up of several kinds of alphanumeric and symbol characters for security. He uses a string of eight random lowercase letters, a string half that length of alternating upper case letters and numbers, and one symbol on each end of the password. How many characters in all is Pat‘s computer password?
A: The second string of characters is half as long as the first string, so it is 8 / 2 = 4 characters long. The password has one symbol on each end, so it has 1 * 2 = 2 symbol characters. In all, Pat’s computer password is 8 + 4 + 2 = 14 characters long. The answer is 14.
Question: Coby went on a road trip. He is traveling from Washington to Nevada but he needs to stop in Idaho which is 640 miles away from Washington and 550 miles away from Nevada to pick up some friends. If Coby is traveling at a speed of 80 miles per hour going to Idaho and at a speed of 50 miles per hour from Idaho to Nevada, how many hours did it take for him to arrive at the destination?
Answer: The estimated time of arrival from Washington to Idaho is 640 / 80 = 8 hours. So, the estimated time of arrival from Idaho to Nevada is 550 / 50 = 11 hours. Therefore, It took him 11 + 8 = 19 hours to arrive at the destination. The answer is 19.
[Question]A case of water contains 24 bottles. A children's camp comprising of 4 groups purchased 13 cases for a 3-day camp. The first group has 14 children, the second group has 16 children, the third group has 12 children, and the fourth group has half of the number of the first three groups combined. If each child consumes 3 bottles a day, how many more bottles of water does the camp organizer still need to buy?
[Answer]The first three groups have a total of 14 + 16 + 12 = 42 children. The fourth group has 42 / 2 = 21 children. All together, the camp has 42 + 21 = 63 children. In one day, the children consume 3 x 63 = 189 bottles of water. In 3 days, the children will need 189 x 3 = 567 bottles of water. The camp organizer has already purchased 13 x 24 = 312 bottles of water. The camp organizer must buy another 567 - 312 = 255 bottles of water. The answer is 255.
