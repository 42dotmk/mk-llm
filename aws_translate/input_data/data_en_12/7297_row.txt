By Ted Thornhill and Reuters The trial in China of a British corporate investigator and his American wife and business partner arrested a year ago after they did work for GlaxoSmithKline PLC will be closed to the public, two family friends with knowledge of the matter said. The detention of Peter Humphrey and Yu Yingzeng has sent shockwaves through the foreign business community. For years, the community has relied on investigative firms such as the couple's Shanghai-based company ChinaWhys to better understand the Chinese business environment. In April 2013, GSK employed ChinaWhys to investigate an ex-employee suspected of sending anonymous emails, including the circulation of an intimate video of former GSK China head Mark Reilly with his girlfriend, as well as emails containing allegations of widespread bribery at the British drugmaker.
