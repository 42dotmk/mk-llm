Question: Julia's internet speed is 20 MBps (megabytes per second). How many songs she can download in half an hour if the size per song is 5MB?
Answer: 1 hour has 60 minutes, therefore 1 / 2 hour has 1 / 2 * 60 = 30 minutes. 1 minute has 60 seconds, therefore 30 minutes has 30 * 60 = 1800 seconds. If Julia's internet speed is 20MBps and each song has a size of 5MB, then it would take 5 / 20 = 1 / 4 seconds to download one song. If it takes 1 / 4 seconds to download 1 song, then in 1800 seconds, Julia could download 1800 / (1 / 4) = 1800 * 4 = 7200 songs. The answer is 7200.
[Question]Amy biked 12 miles yesterday. If she biked 3 miles less than twice as far as yesterday, how many miles did she bike in total in the two days?
[Answer]Twice the distance Amy biked yesterday is 12 * 2 = 24 miles. If Amy biked 3 miles less than twice as far as yesterday, she biked 24 - 3 = 21 miles today. The total distance she biked in the two days is 21 + 12 = 33 miles. The answer is 33.
Q: Wild Bill can shoot a pistol while riding his horse at full speed. His horse runs at 20 feet per second, and a bullet fired from his gun flies at a speed of 400 feet per second. But if he fires a gun while riding his horse, and the gun is aimed in the same direction that the horse is running, how much faster, in feet per second, is the bullet flying than if he fires the bullet in the opposite direction of what the horse was running?
A: If he fires a bullet in the same direction as the direction that the horse is running, the total speed of the bullet is the sum of the speed the bullet was propelled out of the gun plus the speed of the horse, for a combined speed of 400 + 20 = 420 feet per second. If he fires a bullet in the opposite direction as the direction in which the horse is running, then the total speed of the bullet is the speed the bullet was propelled out of the gun minus the speed of the horse, for a resulting speed of 400 - 20 = 380 feet per second. Thus, when firing the gun in the same direction as the horse is running, the bullet moves at 420 - 380 = 40 feet per second faster than when he fires the bullet in the opposite direction as what the horse is running. The answer is 40.
Question: Michael and Thomas are selling their lego collections. They agree to split any money they earn. They sell them based on how many circles are on top. Each circle costs 1 cent. They earned $5 each after selling 100 single pieces, 45 double pieces, 50 triple pieces and a number of quadruple pieces. How many quadruple pieces did they sell?
Answer: They made $10 because 2 x 5 = 10. They made $1 off single pieces because 100 x .01 = 1. They made $.9 off double pieces because 45 x .02 = .9. They made $1.5 off triple pieces because 50 x .03 = 1.5. They earned $3.4 off the first three types because 1 + .9 + 1.5 = 3.4. They earned $6.6 off the quadruple pieces because 10 - 3.4 = 6.6. They sold 165 quadruple pieces because 6.6 / .04 = 165. The answer is 165.
[Question]John watches a TV show and they announce they are going to do 1 more season. Each season is 22 episodes except for the last season which is 4 episodes longer. There were 9 seasons before the announcement. If each episode is .5 hours how long will it take to watch them all after the last season finishes?
[Answer]There are currently 9 * 22 = 198 episodes out. The new season will have 22 + 4 = 26 episodes. So the total number of episodes is 198 + 26 = 224 episodes. So it will take 224 * .5 = 112 hours to watch them all. The answer is 112.
