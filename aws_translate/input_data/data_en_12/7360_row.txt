These two questions are inquiring about different information.

+no.

Now, I will respond to each question separately.

1. How does a Facebook app like Love or Friendship calculator works?

A Facebook app like Love or Friendship calculator typically uses a combination of algorithms, user inputs, and data mining techniques to generate compatibility scores or results. Here's a general overview of how the process works:

a. User authorization and data collection: The user usually needs to authorize the app to access their Facebook data. The app then collects personal information from the user's profile, such as age, gender, location, relationship status, mutual friends, likes, and posts.

b. User input: Depending on the app, the user may be asked to input information about themselves, the person they are interested in, and their preferences in a partner or friend. This may include personality traits, physical appearance, hobbies, interests, and other factors that could affect compatibility.

c. Algorithm and calculation: The app applies its algorithm, which is a set of predefined rules or formulae designed to analyze the collected data and user inputs. The algorithm processes the data to determine which factors are most important in defining compatibility and assigns different weights to each factor. It may involve deriving meaningful relationships between data points, analyzing patterns, calculating similarity or distance metrics, and applying machine learning techniques.

d. Result presentation: After processing the data, the app calculates a compatibility score or result that quantifies the level of compatibility between the users or their compatibility with the ideal match. The app may present the score as a percentage, a graphical representation, or a simple statement like "You are a great match" or "You are just friends."

Please note that these apps are largely for entertainment purposes, and their results should not be taken too seriously. The algorithms behind these apps are not scientifically accurate and cannot truly predict the success of personal relationships.

2. How does it feel like to always be an option to others? In terms of love life, friendship, work.

Feeling like an option rather than a priority can lead to various emotional responses. I will outline some of the possible emotions and thoughts one might experience in different aspects of life.

a. Love life: In a romantic relationship, feeling like an option might cause a person to feel undervalued, insecure, and unloved. They may question their partner's commitment and their own worthiness of love. It can lead to emotional stress, self-doubt, and a decline in self-esteem.

b. Friendship: In friendship, repeatedly feeling like an option can result in feelings of loneliness, hurt, and resentment. One might feel taken for granted, unappreciated, and used by their friends. This may lead to questions of whether the friendship truly serves its purpose and if it has any real value.

c. Work: In a professional setting, feeling like an option may result in a lack of motivation, decreased job satisfaction, and low self-confidence. One might feel that their efforts are not recognized, their opinions are not valued, and their work is not genuinely appreciated. Over time, this could harm not only one's career but also their mental well-being.

To overcome these negative emotions and situations, it is essential for individuals to assert their boundaries and communicate effectively with their partners, friends, and colleagues about their feelings and needs. Developing self-confidence and knowing one's worth is also crucial for maintaining healthy relationships in all aspects of life.
