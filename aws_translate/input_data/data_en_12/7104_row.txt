Question: John's car gets 30 mpg. He drives 20 miles to work each way 5 days a week. He also drives another 40 miles a week for leisure travel. How many gallons of gas does he use a week?
Answer: He drives 20 * 2 = 40 miles per day for work. So he drives 40 * 5 = 200 miles for work. So he drives a total of 200 + 40 = 240 miles per week. That means he uses 240 / 30 = 8 gallons of gas a week. The answer is 8.
[Question]A swimming pool is being emptied through a drain at the bottom of the pool and filled by a hose at the top. The drain can empty the pool in 4 hours and the hose can fill the pool in 6 hours. The pool holds 120 liters of water. If the pool starts filled with water, how much water will be left after 3 hours?
[Answer]It takes the drain 4 hours to empty the pool, so it drains at a rate of 120 liters / 4 hours = 30 liters / hour. After 3 hours, the drain will have removed 3 * 30 = 90 liters of water from the pool. It takes the hose 6 hours to fill the pool, so it fills at a rate of 120 liters / 6 hours = 20 liters / hour. After 3 hours, the hose will have added 3 * 20 = 60 liters of water to the pool. After 3 hours, there will be 120 liters + 60 liters – 90 liters = 90 liters of water left in the pool. The answer is 90.
Q: Shane wants to take as many photos as possible this year. He takes 146 photos in the first 2 months of the year. In January, he takes 2 photos every day. The rest of the photos were taken in February. If in February he took an equal number of photos each week, how many photos did Shane take each week in February?
A: Shane takes a total of 2 photos / day * 31 days = 62 photos in January. This means he must have taken 146 total photos – 62 January photos = 84 photos in February. As he took an equal number each week, he must have taken 84 photos / 4 weeks = 21 photos each week. The answer is 21.
Question: If the price of a bag of cherries is $5 when the price of a bag of olives is $7, how much would Jordyn pay for buying 50 bags of each fruit and a 10% discount?
Answer: At a 10 percent discount, Jordyn will pay 10 / 100% * $5 = $.50 less for a bag of cherries. To buy one of the cherries at a 10% discount Jordyn will pay $5 - $0.50 = $4.50. The cost of buying 50 bags of cherries at the 10% discount is 50 * 4.50 = $225. Also, at a 10% discount, Jordyn will pay 10 / 100 * $7 = $0.70 less for a bag of olives. The price of a bag of olives at a 10% discount is $7 - $0.70 = $6.3. To buy 50 bags of olives Jordyn will pay $6.3 * 50 = $315. The total cost of buying 50 bags of each fruit at a 10% discount is $315 + $225 = $540. The answer is 540.
[Question]Gentry assembled a new 24 foot round pool in her backyard. To fill the pool with water, she used four hoses. Two of the hoses each deliver water at a rate of 2 gallons per minute. The other two hoses each deliver water at a rate of 3 gallons per minute. With a volume of 15,000 gallons, how many hours will it take to fill the pool?
[Answer]Each of the two hoses delivers water at a rate of 2 gallons per minute, for a combined total of 2 * 2 = 4 gallons of water per minute. The other two hoses each deliver water at a rate of 3 gallons per minute, for a combined total of 2 * 3 = 6 gallons of water per minute. Thus, all four hoses deliver a combined total of 4 + 6 = 10 gallons of water per minute. With a volume of 15,000 gallons, it would take 15,000 / 10 = 1500 minutes to fill the pool. Converting to hours, it will take 1500 / 60 = 25 hours to fill the pool. The answer is 25.
