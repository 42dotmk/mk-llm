Question: Nancy takes 3 antacids per day when she eats Indian food, 2 antacids per day when she eats Mexican food, and 1 antacid per day otherwise. If Nancy eats Indian three times a week and Mexican twice a week, how many antacids does she take per month?
Answer: First find the total number of antacids Nancy takes after eating Indian food per week: 3 antacids / day * 3 days / week = 9 antacids / week. Then find the total number of antacids Nancy takes after eating Mexican food per week: 2 antacids / day * 2 days / week = 4 antacids / week. Then find the number of days she doesn't eat Indian food or Mexican food: 7 days / week - 3 days / week - 2 days / week = 2 days / week. Then find the total number of antacids Nancy takes per week: 9 antacids / week + 4 antacids / week + 2 antacids / week = 15 antacids / week. Then multiply her weekly antacid consumption by the number of weeks per month to find her monthly consumption: 15 antacids / week * 4 week / month = 60 antacids / month. The answer is 60.
[Question]Hannah wants to save $80 for five weeks. In the first week, she saved $4 and she plans to save twice as much as her savings as the previous week. How much will she save in the fifth week to reach her goal?
[Answer]In the second week, Hannah will save $4 x 2 = $8. In the third week, she will save $8 x 2 = $16. In the fourth week, she will save $16 x 2 = $32. Her total savings for a month will be $4 + $8 + $16 + $32 = $60. Hannah needs to save $80 - $60 = $20 in the fifth week. The answer is 20.
Q: Sam the butcher made sausage by grinding up 10 pounds of spicy meat mix, loading it into a tube casing, and creating a string of 40 sausage links. Then, she hung up the string of sausage links in her cooler. Later that evening, Brandy, Sam’s Golden Retriever, broke into the cooler and ate 12 links of sausage. After Brandy’s feast, how many ounces of sausage meat were contained in the remaining links?
A: There are 16 ounces in one pound, and thus in 10 pounds of meat mix there are 10 * 16 = 160 ounces of sausage meat. Thus, the 40 sausage links contained 160 ounces of meat, or 160 / 40 = 4 ounces per link. If Brandy ate 12 links, then 40 - 12 = 28 links remained. Thus, 28 remaining links, at 4 ounces per link, contained 28 * 4 = 112 ounces of meat. The answer is 112.
Question: In the first round of bowling, Patrick knocked down a total of 70 pins and Richard knocked down 15 more pins than Patrick. In the second round, Patrick knocked down twice as many pins as Richard in the first round and Richard knocked down 3 less than Patrick. How many more pins in total did Richard knock down than Patrick?
Answer: In the first round, Richard knocked down 70 + 15 = 85 pins. In the second round, Patrick knocked down 85 x 2 = 170 pins. In the second round, Richard knocked down 170 - 3 = 167 pins. In total, Patrick knocked down 70 + 170 = 240 pins. In total, Richard knocked down 85 + 167 = 252 pins. Richard knocked down 252 - 240 = 12 pins more than Patrick. The answer is 12.
[Question]Sandy bought 1 million Safe Moon tokens. She has 4 siblings. She wants to keep half of them to herself and divide the remaining tokens among her siblings. After splitting it up, how many more tokens will she have than any of her siblings?
[Answer]She will keep 1000000 / 2 = 500000 Safe Moon tokens for herself. For the remaining siblings, they will each receive 500000 / 4 = 125000 tokens. This means that Sandy will have 500000 - 125000 = 375000 tokens more than any of her siblings. The answer is 375000.
