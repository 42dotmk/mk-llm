Question: Jacob has been tasked with a project to write up an urban plan proposal that will be used to construct a new city. He uses Pittsburg city as a reference which has 2000 stores, 500 hospitals, 200 schools, and 20 police stations. If the new city should have half the number of stores, twice as many hospitals, 50 fewer schools, and 5 more police stations, what is the total number of buildings required for this project?
Answer: The number of stores required for the new city is 2000 / 2 = 1000 stores. The number of hospitals required for the new city is 2 * 500 = 1000 hospitals. The number of schools required for the new city is 200 - 50 = 150 schools. The number of police stations required for the new city is 20 + 5 = 25 police stations. The total number of buildings required for this new city project 1000 + 1000 + 150 + 25 = 2175 buildings. The answer is 2175.
[Question]Three builders build a single floor of a house in 30 days. If each builder is paid $100 for a single day’s work, how much would it cost to hire 6 builders to build 5 houses with 6 floors each?
[Answer]6 builders can build a single floor 6 builders / 3 builders = 2 times as fast as 3 builders. Thus 6 builders would build a single floor in 30 days / 2 = 15 days. There are 5 hours x 6 floors / house = 30 floors in total in 5 houses with 6 floors each. Therefore 6 builders would complete the project in 15 days / floor x 30 floors = 450 days. It would cost 450 days x $100 / day / builder * 6 builders = $270000 to complete the project. The answer is 270000.
Q: There are 3 bicycles, 4 tricycles and 7 unicycles in the garage at Zoe's house. Each bicycle has 2 wheels, each tricycle has 3 wheels and each unicycle has 1 wheel. How many wheels are there in all?
A: The number of bicycle wheels is 2 × 3 = 6. The number of tricycle wheels is 3 × 4 = 12. The number of unicycle wheels is 1 × 7 = 7. The total number of wheels is 6 + 12 + 7 = 25. The answer is 25.
Question: Maisy has been offered a new job and now has the option of continuing to work at her current job or take the new job. Her current job is 8 hours a week with a wage of $10 per hour. The new job is offering 4 hours a week with a wage of $15 per hour with an additional bonus of $35 per week if she exceeds her quota. Maisy is confident that she will exceed her quota and decides to include this when calculating her wage at the new job. How much more money, in dollars, will Maisy earn at her new job?
Answer: At her current job, Maisy earns 8 hours * $10 per hour = $80. At her new job, she would earn 4 hours * $15 per hour = $60. Including her bonus, her new job would pay $60 wage + $35 bonus = $95. So at her new job, she would earn an extra 95 – 80 = $15. The answer is 15.
[Question]Alex was having a cookout Friday night and planned to serve burgers to his guests. He planned to cook 3 burgers for each guest and had invited 10 friends over. 1 of his friends didn't eat meat and said they would bring their own food. Another one of his friends didn't eat bread and would not need the buns. The burger buns came 8 to a pack. How many packs of buns did Alex need to buy?
[Answer]He invited 10 friends but he didn't need to cook for 1 of his friends so that left 10 - 1 = 9 friends to cook for. He was cooking 3 burgers per 9 guests so 3 * 9 = 27 burgers. He needed 27 burger buns but 1 guest wouldn't eat the buns so now he needs 27 - 3 = 24. He will need to buy 24 buns and they come 8 to a pack so he needs 24 / 8 = 3 packs of buns. The answer is 3.
