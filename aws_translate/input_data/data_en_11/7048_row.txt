Question 2: Branded apparels on wholesale price?

Answer: Branded apparels on wholesale price refer to purchasing large quantities of clothes from popular brands at lower prices compared to retail outlets. These items are generally purchased with the intention of reselling, either online or in a physical store. To find branded apparels at wholesale prices, you can follow these steps:

1. Research: Identify the brands you're interested in selling, and understand their pricing, quality, and target market. Conduct market research to find out the demands in your area or online marketplace. 

2. Contact Brand Distributors: Reach out to official brand distributors and inquire about wholesale opportunities. Many brands have strict policies in place to control distribution, so it's essential to follow the correct channels.

3. Attend Trade Shows and Events: Trade shows are an excellent way to network with brand representatives, distributors, and other businesses in the industry. They offer the opportunity to negotiate pricing and establish business relationships with potential partners.

4. Online Wholesale Directories and Platforms: Utilize online wholesale directories to search for apparel suppliers. Some popular websites include Alibaba, DHgate, and Global Sources. Always verify the authenticity of suppliers before making any transactions.

5. Liquidation Sales and Closeout Deals: Major retailers and brands often liquidate their inventory or sell off excess goods at discounted prices. Keep an eye on these opportunities for branded apparels at low costs.

6. Calculate Shipping and Custom Duties: Before placing an order or purchasing wholesale clothing, ensure that you have calculated shipping costs and any customs duties that may apply to import the merchandise.

Remember to maintain a strong relationship with suppliers and negotiate pricing based on the volume of your orders. This will help you secure branded apparels at competitive wholesale prices.
