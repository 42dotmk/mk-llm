The first step in this developmental process is the conception of a human life, which forms the foundation for the entire journey. Conception occurs when a sperm cell from the male successfully fertilizes an egg cell from the female, typically through sexual intercourse or assisted reproductive technology. This event marks the beginning of a new human being, and sets the stage for the various stages and transformations that the individual will go through during their lifetime.

At the moment of conception, a single-celled zygote is formed, which contains the genetic information from both parents. Over the next several days, this zygote undergoes rapid cell division and turns into a multicellular embryo. The embryo then continues to grow and develop, eventually forming a fetus. This entire process takes place within the mother's womb, where the developing baby receives nutrients, oxygen, and protection from the mother's body.

Throughout the nine months of pregnancy, the fetus matures and prepares for life outside the womb. Organ systems, muscles, and bones develop, as well as essential features like the brain, heart, and lungs. Towards the end of pregnancy, the fetus reaches a level of development where it is capable of sustaining itself independently of the mother's body.

The culmination of this pregnancy journey is the birth of the baby. Delivering the baby usually occurs through a natural process called childbirth - which can involve vaginal delivery or a cesarean section. Once the baby is born, it takes its first breath, and life outside the womb officially begins.

Now, as a newborn baby, it transitions through the various stages of life that were mentioned in your question. These stages are significantly influenced by the baby's genes, environment, and societal norms:

1. Babies become infants: The baby grows and develops into an infant, acquiring essential skills such as crawling, sitting up, and holding objects. Feeding, sleeping, and cognitive development are crucial during this phase.

2. Infants become children: As they grow, infants transition into early childhood. In this stage, they further develop their motor skills and begin to learn language, social skills, and gain a sense of independence.

3. Children learn skills: During childhood, play, exploration, and interaction with others shape their learning processes. They acquire various abilities such as problem-solving, communication, and creative thinking.

4. Children become teenagers: Adolescence is marked by physical, emotional, and social changes. Puberty brings about body transformations, while teenagers navigate new relationships and increasingly complex societal expectations.

5. Teenagers undergo puberty: Hormonal changes in puberty result in sexual maturation, growth spurts, and emotional development during this stage.

6. Teenagers become adults: Reaching adulthood signifies the assumption of greater responsibility, a growing sense of self, and often the beginning of a career or the pursuit of higher education.

7. Adults have children: Many adults decide to have children, thus continuing the cycle of human life.

8. Adults become elderly: As the aging process continues, adults enter their senior years, which can involve retirement, new hobbies, and adjusting to a more leisurely lifestyle.

9. Elderly humans die: Eventually, the body succumbs to the natural aging process, leading to the end of life.

In summary, the first step in the process of human development is conception, which sets the stage for a continuous journey of growth, learning, and transformation that spans the entire course of an individual's life.
