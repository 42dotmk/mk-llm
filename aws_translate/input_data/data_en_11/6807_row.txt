I choose the story where Christine used the computer.

---

Despite the unfortunate incident with the bowling ball, Christine managed to salvage the computer's hard drive, which contained all her important files and documents. She sighed in relief, thankful that her previous practice of backing up her data had paid off. Knowing the importance of the data stored on the computer, Christine set to work. Her eyes scanned the screen, her fingers tapping away at the keyboard as she went about organizing her tasks for the day.

Mary, on the other hand, was riddled with guilt for accidentally dropping the bowling ball. As Christine's roommate, she knew all too well how important the computer was to her friend. She had seen Christine spend countless hours working on her projects, researching, and running her online business. It pained her to be the cause of an accident that could have destroyed something so valuable, but she vowed to make amends.

Christine was part of a small team working on a groundbreaking software that would help businesses automate mundane tasks, making the lives of professionals significantly easier. As a venture-backed startup in the tough world of technology, they needed to work fast while ensuring the highest quality and security for their software. Even a single lost day of work could potentially jeopardize their standing in this competitive market.

Taking note of Mary's attempts at making amends, Christine decided to accept her roommate's help. Mary admitted that she was technologically challenged, but she did possess excellent interpersonal and organizational skills that could prove beneficial to Christine's work. Eager to demonstrate her dedication, Mary promptly researched tips and tricks for assisting Christine, studying everything from project management tools to communication strategies to keep the work progressing smoothly.

As the weeks went by, Mary came to grasp the ins and outs of Christine's software project, swiftly becoming an indispensable part of the team. She assumed the role of a project manager, holding meetings with other team members, setting milestones, and tracking the project's progress. The well-oiled machine that they had become moved forward with renewed strength. Christine was pleasantly surprised to discover the added benefits Mary brought to her work; not only did her efficiency improve, but she was also able to focus on more creative aspects with Mary handling the logistical side of things. The bond between these two friends grew stronger, forged not just through affection but a sense of mutual understanding, respect, and collaboration.

As the deadline approached, the team's software had reached a level beyond what they had initially aimed for. It was an impressive feat they owed not only to the brilliant minds that conceptualized it, but also to the nerve of steel, hard work, and sheer determination of each member of the project, including Mary. Amidst the chaos and anxiety, Christine couldn't help but feel lucky to have someone like Mary by her side. What started as an unfortunate accident had turned into a beautiful partnership.

In due course, the software was launched, and their team quickly gained recognition in the tech industry, generating an enthusiastic buzz. The response to their efforts was overwhelming, with investors and businesses alike clamoring to be part of this success story. Throughout it all, Christine and Mary continued to work together in harmony. They stood as a testament to what can be accomplished when resilience, empathy, and dedication are combined, not just in technology but in the world as a whole.
