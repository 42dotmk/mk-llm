Q: There are 360 balls in the ball pit. If a quarter of the balls in the ball pit are red and a fifth of the remaining balls are blue. How many of the balls are neither red nor blue?
A: A quarter of the balls are red and therefore there are 360 x (1 / 4) = 90 red balls. When you remove the red balls from the ball pit there are 360 - 90 = 270 remaining balls. A fifth of the remaining balls are blue, and therefore there are 270 x (1 / 5) = 54 blue balls. The total of red and blue balls equals 90 + 54 = 144 balls. When you remove the red and blue balls from the total there are 360 - 144 = 216 balls that are neither red nor blue. The answer is 216.
Question: A state fair charges $5 for a ticket. Two-thirds of the people who buy a ticket will buy deep-fried fair food for $8, one quarter will go on a ride for $4, and one eighth will spend $15 on a souvenir. The fair made $2520 from tickets. How many dollars did they make in all?
Answer: The fair made $2520 from tickets, so they had 2520 / 5 = 504 people attend the fair. Two - thirds of those people will buy food, so 504 * 2 / 3 = 336 people will buy food. The fair will make 336 * 8 = $2688 from food. A quarter of the people will go on a ride, so 504 / 4 = 126 people will go on a ride. The fair will make 126 * 4 = $504 from rides. An eighth of the people will buy a souvenir, so 504 / 8 = 63 people will buy souvenirs. The fair will make 63 * 15 = $945 from souvenirs. In all, the fair will make 2520 + 2688 + 504 + 945 = $6657. The answer is 6657.
[Question]Andrew's father buys a package of 100 masks. Andrew lives with his 2 parents and 2 siblings. All members of Andrew's family change masks every 4 days. How many days will it take to finish the pack of masks?
[Answer]Andrew's family consists of 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 people. Each of Andrew's family members uses 100 masks / 5 = 20 masks. With everyone wearing a mask every 4 days, the masks will last 20 masks * 4 days / mask = 80 days. The answer is 80.
Q: A road has four lanes, and in each lane, the number of cars is twice as many as the number of trucks in all the lanes. If there are 60 trucks in each lane, calculate the total number of vehicles in all the lanes?
A: If the road has four lanes and 60 trucks in each lane, the total number of trucks in all the lanes is 60 * 4 = 240. Since in each lane the number of cars is twice as many as the number of trucks in all the lanes, there are 2 * 240 = 480 cars in each lane. The total number of cars in all the lanes is 480 * 4 = 1920. In all the lanes, the total number of vehicles is 240 trucks + 1920 cars = 2160. The answer is 2160.
Question: In a single day, it rained for many hours. From 2pm to 4pm, it rained at a rate of 4 inches per hour. From 4pm to 7pm, it rained at a rate of 3 inches per hour. And from 7pm to 9pm, it rained at a rate of 0.5 inches per hour. If the rain gauge started out the day already containing 2 inches of rainwater, how many inches of water will the gauge contain at 9pm?
Answer: From 2pm to 4pm is 4 - 2 = 2 hours. Thus, from 2 - 4pm, raining at 4 inches per hour, it added 8 inches to the rain gauge. From 4pm to 7pm is 7 - 4 = 3 hours. Thus, from 4 - 7pm, raining at a rate of 3 inches per hour, it added 3 * 3 = 9 inches to the rain gauge. From 7pm to 9pm is 9 - 7 = 2 hours. Thus, from 7 - 9pm, raining at a rate of 0.5 inches per hour, it added 2 * 0.5 = 1 inch to the gauge. If the gauge originally contained 2 inches of water, by 9pm the gauge contained 2 + 8 + 9 + 1 = 20 inches of water. The answer is 20.
