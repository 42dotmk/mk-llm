The type of law that defines "states" and their role in an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is international maritime law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). UNCLOS is a comprehensive international treaty that governs various aspects of maritime affairs, including the rights and responsibilities of states with respect to their use of the world's oceans. The Convention was adopted in 1982 and has been widely recognized as a key component of the international legal framework governing ocean affairs.

In UNCLOS, "states" are defined as sovereign countries that are recognized by the international community as having the rights and responsibilities associated with statehood. States are the primary subjects of international law, and they possess unique rights and responsibilities for their territories, maritime zones, and the international areas of the oceans. Specifically, under UNCLOS, states have the responsibility to preserve and protect the marine environment, undertake scientific research, conserve living resources, and promote the peaceful use of oceans, among other duties.

An Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is a maritime zone prescribed by UNCLOS, extending up to 200 nautical miles from a state's baseline, which is usually the low-water line along its coast. Within its EEZ, a coastal state has special rights regarding the exploration, exploitation, conservation, and management of natural resources, both living and non-living, in the water column and on or under the seabed. It is important to note that the EEZ does not encompass the territorial sea, which extends up to 12 nautical miles from the baseline, where a state exercises full sovereignty.

The role of states in an Exclusive Economic Zone is primarily governed by Articles 55 to 75 of UNCLOS. Within their EEZ, states have the sovereign rights to explore, exploit, conserve, and manage the natural resources, both living and non-living. This includes the seabed, subsoil, and superjacent waters, as well as the control of other activities such as marine scientific research and the protection and preservation of the marine environment.

Moreover, states have specific responsibilities to cooperate with other states and regional or international organizations to ensure the sustainable management of fish stocks and to protect and preserve the marine environment. They must also promote the objective of the optimum utilization of living resources in the EEZ and prevent over-exploitation. In this context, coastal states are required to establish total allowable catches and implement conservation measures, taking into account the best scientific evidence available.

It is important to note that the rights and responsibilities of states in their EEZs are subject to some limitations established by UNCLOS. For example, other states enjoy the right of freedom of navigation and overflight, as well as the right to lay submarine cables and pipelines, subject to certain conditions. Additionally, Article 58 recognizes the rights and duties of other states in the EEZ, provided that they are exercised "in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Convention."

In conclusion, international maritime law, encapsulated in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, defines "states" and their role in Exclusive Economic Zones. It provides a comprehensive legal framework that governs the rights, responsibilities, and limitations of states in the management of resources, environmental protection, and other activities in their EEZs, as well as the rights and duties of other states in this maritime zone.
