Q: Tricia is a third of Amilia’s age and Amilia is a quarter of Yorick’s age. Yorick is twice Eugene’s age and Khloe is a third of Eugene’s age. Rupert is 10 years older than Khloe but 2 years younger than Vincent who is 22 years old. How old, in years, is Tricia?
A: Rupert is younger than Vincent by 2 years, so he is 22 years old – 2 years = 20 years old. Khloe is 10 years younger than Rupert so she is 20 years old – 10 years = 10 years old. Eugene is 3 times older than Khloe so he is 10 years old * 3 = 30 years old. Yorick is twice Eugene’s age so he is 30 years old * 2 = 60 years old. Amilia is a quarter of Yorick’s age so she is 60 years old / 4 = 15 years old. Tricia is a third of Amilia’s age so she is 15 years old / 3 = 5 years old. The answer is 5.
Question: Harrison Elementary School is overcrowded with 1590 students, so 40% of the students are going to move to a new school. There are 3 grade levels, and each grade level needs one 20-person advanced class and the rest of the students divided evenly into 6 additional classes. How many students will there be in each normal class at the new school?
Answer: First find how many students go to the new school: 1590 students * .4 = 636 students. Then divide that number by 3 to find how many students are at each grade level: 636 students / 3 grades = 212 students / grade. Then subtract the 20 students in the gifted class: 212 students - 20 students = 192 students. Then divide that number by 6 to find the number of students in each other class: 192 students / 6 classes = 32 students / class. The answer is 32.
[Question]Gina's snake eats one mouse every 4 weeks. How many mice will it eat in a decade?
[Answer]First find the number of mice the snake eats each year: 52 weeks / year / 4 weeks / mouse = 13 mice / year. Then multiply the number of mice the snake eats per year by the number of years per decade to find the number of mice it eats per decade: 13 mice / year * 10 years / decade = 130 mice / decade. The answer is 130.
Q: There's a sale at your favorite "Any item $10" retailer. If you buy 1 shirt you pay $10. If you buy 2, you get the second one at a 50% discount. If you buy 3, you get the third one at a 60% discount. How much money did you save if you bought 3 shirts?
A: The first shirt has no (0%) discount off the regular price ($10), therefore your discount is = 0% * $10 = $0. The second shirt has a 50% discount off the regular price ($10), therefore your discount is = 50% * $10 = $5. The third shirt has a 60% discount of the regular price ($10), therefore your discount is = 60% * $10 = $6. Therefore in total, you save $0 on the first shirt, $5 on the second one and $6 on the third one = 0 + 5 + 6 = $11. The answer is 11.
Question: To buy a book, you pay $20 for each of the first 5 books at the supermarket, and for each additional book you buy over $20, you receive a discount of $2. If Beatrice bought 20 books, how much did she pay at the supermarket?
Answer: For the first five books, the total cost is $20 * 5 = $100. For every additional book over $5, you pay $2 less, totaling to $20 - $2 = $18. Beatrice bought 20 books, so the number of books at which she received the $2 discount is 20 - 5 = 15 books. For the 15 books, Beatrice paid 15 * $18 = $270. In total, Beatrice paid $100 + $270 = $370 for the 20 books. The answer is 370.
