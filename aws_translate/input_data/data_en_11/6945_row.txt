Question: Ivan buys 48 apples to make 24 full-size pies. He ends up not using as many as he thought because he decides to make mini pies instead of full-size ones, which only use 1/2 an apple each. If Ivan bakes 24 mini pies, how many apples does he have leftover?
Answer: Ivan wants to bake 24 pies which use 1 / 2 an apple each, 24 pies x 1 / 2 apple each = 12 apples. Ivan uses 12 of his 48 apples, 48 - 12 = 36 apples. Ivan has 36 apples leftover. The answer is 36.
[Question]Carlo has a music recital next week. He practiced twice as long on Monday as on Tuesday. On Tuesday, he practiced 10 minutes less than on Wednesday. On Wednesday, he practiced 5 minutes more than on Thursday. On Thursday, he practiced for 50 minutes. If he needs to practice for a total of 5 hours that week, how long should Carlo practice on Friday?
[Answer]On Wednesday, Carlo practiced for 50 + 5 = 55 minutes. On Tuesday, he practiced for 55 - 10 = 45 minutes. On Monday, he practiced for 45 x 2 = 90 minutes. So, Carlo practiced for a total of 90 + 45 + 55 + 50 = 240 minutes from Monday to Thursday. He needs to practice for a total of 60 x 5 = 300 minutes. Therefore, he should practice for 300 - 240 = 60 minutes on Friday. The answer is 60.
Q: An archer needs to practice. He intends to shoot 200 shots 4 days a week. He is able to recover 20% of his arrows. The arrows he uses cost $5.5 per arrow. His team agrees to pay for 70% of the cost of his arrows. How much does he spend for arrows a week?
A: He shoots 200 * 4 = 800 shots per week. He can recover 800 * .2 = 160 of those arrows. So he uses 800 - 160 = 640 arrows a week. The cost for those arrows would come out to 640 * 5.5 = $3520 per week. His team pays for 3520 * .7 = $2464 of that. So he has to pay 3520 - 2464 = $1056 per week for arrows. The answer is 1056.
Question: The number of Oreos and cookies in a box is in the ratio 4:9. Zane bought each Oreo at $2 and each cookie at $3. How much more money did Zane spend on buying the cookies than buying the Oreos if the total number of items in the box is 65?
Answer: The total ratio representing the number of cookies and Oreos that Zack bought is 4 + 9 = 13. The fraction representing the number of Oreos Zane bought is 4 / 13, and since the total number of items in the box is 65, Zane bought 4 / 13 * 65 = 20 Oreos. If Zane bought 20 Oreos at $2 each, the total cost of buying Oreos is $2 * 20 = $40. Since the total number of items in the box is 65, and there are 20 Oreos in the box, the number of cookies in the box is 65 - 20 = 45. The cost of buying the cookies at $3 each is 45 * $3 = $135. If the Oreos cost $40 to buy, Zane used $135 - $40 = $95 more to buy Cookies than Oreos. The answer is 95.
[Question]A group of friends walked into Jujuâ€™s Juice Bar ordered a glass of fruit juice each. They spent a total of $94. Some of them ordered mango juice, which sells for $5 a glass, while others asked for pineapple juice, at $6 a glass. If $54 was spent on pineapple juice, how many people were in the group?
[Answer]The amount spent on mango juice is 94 - 54 = 40 dollars. Dividing the 40 dollars by the cost of a glass of mango juice gives us 40 / 5 = 8 people. Since a glass of pineapple juice goes for $6, the number that ordered is 54 / 6 = 9 people. Adding both numbers gives a total of 8 + 9 = 17 people. The answer is 17.
