Benjamin was playing in the mud. 

Children often enjoy the simple pleasures of life that adults often overlook or simply disregard due to the complications they often bring. One of these simple pleasures is running amok in the great outdoors after a rain shower, when the ground is ripe and wet, and little puddles of water form on every depression on the terrain. Benjamin, just like any other child his age, had recently discovered this muddy haven and the adventures it had to offer. 

Every other day, when the sky was pouring, and most parents would keep their children indoors out of fear they'd catch a cold, Benjamin's house was different. His parents, who believed in the joy and learning that nature exploration could bring, allowed him to go out and experience the world, even in its messiest forms. Therefore, on a Saturday morning, when it had been raining cats and dogs the night before, Benjamin woke up eager and enthusiastic, looking forward to splashing through the accumulated showers and playing in the mud puddles.

Donned in his favorite pair of boots, Benjamin made his way outside. The fresh smell of rain and earth filling his lungs, he started to run and jump around, splashing in puddles and rolling in the mud. His laughter echoing through the quiet Saturday morning, as he sculpted the mud into whatever his creative mind could conjure up.

By the afternoon, however, his clothes were soiled with mud stains. His shirt, once a vibrant red, was now a dull brown, his shorts had patterns that made him look like a miniature soldier in camouflage, and his boots painted with splatters of mud.

And as much as he enjoyed being in the mud, the cleanup afterwards was a task his mother staunchly refused to do stating the muddy clothes were a result of his adventure and he should take responsibility for them. This is where Benjamin relied on his older brother, Joseph, to help him out. Seeing his younger brother, wide-eyed and hoping he'd help, Joseph couldn't resist but assist him with his muddy dilemma.

Joseph needed to boil some water to clean Benjamin's soiled clothes because detergent and cold water just wouldn't do the trick. Boiling hot water was needed to break down the grime and muddy streaks that had encrusted his younger brother's clothes. Joseph filled up a large pot with water and set it to boil on the stove. While they waited for the water to heat up, they separated Benjamin's clothes into small piles based on color. Once the water began bubbling, he carefully submerged Benjaminâ€™s clothes into the pot, taking care not to scorch himself with the hot water. He added a generous amount of soap to ensure a deep clean and stirred the clothes gently with a wooden stick.

As Joseph cleaned the clothes, Benjamin sat by his side. Seeing his older brother doing his part made Benjamin realize that play and fun were enjoyable, but they also came with responsibilities all their own. This muddy adventure, thus, was not just a day of fun for Benjamin but was also a day of learning about responsibility and consequences of actions. His brother had managed to make the chore fun, teaching and guiding him, strengthening their bond, through something as simple as cleaning his soiled clothes. The day ended not with the setting sun or clean clothes hanging to dry, but two brothers smiling and laughing together, a bond strengthened, and a lesson well-learnt.

So, Joseph had to boil some water to clean Benjamin's soiled clothes, not only because Benjamin was playing in the mud, but also because this simple act had greater lessons to teach about responsibility, consequences, and the bond of brotherhood.
