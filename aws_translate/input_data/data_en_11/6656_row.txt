The implementation of structural reforms, which I believe is the most politically challenging part of the Lisbon Treaty, must be our primary political objective.

The Lisbon Treaty, which came into force on December 1, 2009, aims to enhance the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the European Union (EU) and to strengthen its global role. The treaty consists of numerous amendments that seek to reform the EU's institutional structure, as well as to improve its decision-making processes. However, the success of these reforms is largely dependent on their proper implementation by EU member states, which, as mentioned above, poses significant political challenges.

One of the key structural reforms introduced by the Lisbon Treaty is the strengthening of the role of the European Parliament (EP) in the legislative process. This is achieved by extending the co-decision procedure, now known as the ordinary legislative procedure, to a wider range of policy areas. It enables the EP to have an equal say with the Council of the European Union on the adoption of EU legislation. As a result, the democratic legitimacy of the EU decision-making process has been enhanced, given the direct election of EP members by European citizens.

Another important structural reform is the new voting system in the Council of the European Union, known as the double majority voting system. This system requires a majority of both the member states and the EU population for a decision to be approved. It was designed to ensure that decisions made within the Council are more representative of the EU's diverse population while also preventing individual member states from blocking decisions that are supported by a majority of other members.

Furthermore, the Lisbon Treaty also introduced changes to the European Commission, the EU's executive body. It reduced the number of European Commissioners by making their appointment based on a rotation system among member states. This change aimed to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the Commission's work, as well as to encourage cooperation among member states.

Despite these structural reforms, there are still numerous political challenges that need to be addressed. One of the most pertinent issues is the EU's democratic deficit, which refers to a perceived disconnect between EU institutions and European citizens. Although the Lisbon Treaty has strengthened the role of the EP, many citizens still feel a lack of influence on EU decision-making. This issue can be addressed by improving communication between EU institutions and citizens, as well as by encouraging greater citizen participation in the political process.

Another important challenge is the difficulty of forging consensus among the 27 EU member states on key policy issues. This task is becoming increasingly complex as the EU continues to face various internal and external challenges, such as migration, economic inequality, and climate change. Addressing these challenges and implementing the structural reforms called for by the Lisbon Treaty will require strong political leadership and a commitment to dialogue and cooperation among member states.

In conclusion, the implementation of structural reforms as part of the Lisbon Treaty is a crucial step towards achieving a more effective, democratic, and globally influential European Union. While there are undoubtedly political challenges to overcome, with strong leadership and genuine commitment from member states, these reforms have the potential to significantly improve the functioning of the EU and the quality of life for its citizens.
