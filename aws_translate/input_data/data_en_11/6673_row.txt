there were many problems with a world map, however, for the rapid increase in information coming from exploration of the earth meant that maps rapidly became outdated.

The transformation of world maps through time can be attributed to the continuous exploration and discovery of new territories, which rendered older maps obsolete. This process of cartographic evolution was a result of various factors, including the advancements in navigation and surveying technologies, the increase in global trade and travel, and the thirst for knowledge regarding the unknown territories.

In the early stages of map making, the data collected was often limited and, at times, faulty. This was primarily due to the lack of reliable tools and methods for navigation, measurement, and representation of the earth's surface. Mariners and explorers of the time relied heavily on lunar and stellar observations, rudimentary compasses, and the accounts of other travelers.

As a result, early maps were relatively inaccurate, often depicting exaggerated landmasses, misplaced locations, and an overabundance of speculative details. In some instances, these early maps even displayed a distorted view of the world, such as the notorious misconceptions that the earth was flat or that it was made up of multiple concentric spheres.

However, with the dawn of the Age of Exploration in the 15th century, the demand for accurate and updated maps grew rapidly. New territories, such as the Americas and parts of Asia, were being discovered, and existing knowledge of the world needed to be expanded and refined. This period saw a flurry of advancements in navigation and surveying techniques, which played a significant role in the improvement of cartography.

Instruments like the astrolabe, quadrant, and later the sextant were developed to aid in celestial navigation, while trigonometry and plane table surveying techniques were introduced as a means of creating more accurate land surveys. Furthermore, the invention of the printing press allowed for the wider dissemination of maps and travel accounts, contributing to a better understanding and documentation of the earth's surface.

During this era of exploration, prominent cartographers, like Gerardus Mercator, Abraham Ortelius, and Martin Waldseem√ºller, among others, emerged to create some of the most influential maps in history. Unfortunately, despite their significant contributions to the field, these maps still contained elements of distortion and inaccuracies due to the challenges posed by the vast and complex nature of the earth's surface.

As time went on, the scientific measurement and mapping methods continued to improve, and cartographers were able to create increasingly accurate maps. The development of nautical charts, geodetic surveying techniques, and even satellite imaging have allowed for more precise representation of the earth's geography. Yet, it should be noted that even with these advancements, no map can be perfect, as the three-dimensional nature of the earth's surface will always present challenges when attempting to represent it on a two-dimensional plane.

In conclusion, the rapid increase in information coming from the exploration of the earth has historically posed a challenge for the creation and updating of world maps. Early maps were plagued by limited data and incorrect assumptions, but with the advent of new technologies and methodologies, cartography experienced significant progress. As mapping techniques continue to evolve, cartographers strive to overcome the inherent challenges of representing our ever-changing world on a map.
