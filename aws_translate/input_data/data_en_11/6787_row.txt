Let a be the amount of time Maryann spends doing accounting and c be the amount of time she spends calling clients: We know that a + c = 560 and a = 7c. Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get 7c + c = 560. Combining like terms, we get 8c = 560. Dividing both sides by 8, we get c = 70.
The answer: 70
Reverse engineering the question: Maryann spends seven times as long doing accounting as calling clients. If she worked 560 minutes today, how many minutes did she spend calling clients?

Reasoning and answer: It will take 3 * 5 = 15 minutes to brush his cats. All together, it will take 45 + 60 + 30 + 15 = 150 minutes to clean his apartment. In three hours, there are 60 * 3 = 180 minutes. Thus, he will have 180 - 150 = 30 minutes of free time remaining.
The answer: 30

Question: Gunther needs to clean his apartment. It takes him 45 minutes to vacuum the carpets, 60 minutes to dust the furniture, 30 minutes to mop the floors in his kitchen, and 5 minutes to brush each cat, and he has three cats. If he has 3 hours of free time available, and he uses this time to clean his apartment, how many minutes of free time will he have left after he cleans the apartment?

American Summits donated 45 x 2 = 90 bottled waters. Hormel donated 45 x 3 = 135 spams. Boudin Bakery donated 135 x 1 / 3 = 45 sourdoughs. Del Monte Foods donated 90 - 30 = 60 canned fruits. Therefore, a total of 45 + 90 + 135 + 45 + 60 = 375 different food.
The answer: 375
Reverse engineering the question: Five food companies sponsored a local food bank. Foster Farms donated 45 dressed chickens; American Summits donated twice the number of bottled water than the number of dressed chicken donated by Foster Farms; Hormel donated three times the number of dressed chickens that Foster Farms donated; Boudin Butchers donated one-third of the number of dressed chickens that Hormel donated; Del Monte Foods donated 30 fewer bottles of water than American Summits. How many food items did the companies donate in total?

Reasoning and answer: Since the hypotenuse of a triangle is found by the square root of the base squared plus the height squared. The square of the base of the first triangle is 4 * 4 = 16 square inches. The square of the height of the first triangle is 3 * 3 = 9 square inches. The sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16 + 9 = 25. The square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is âˆš25 = 5 inches. Since the perimeter of a triangle is found by adding the sides of the triangle, the base and height of the triangle sum up to 3 + 4 = 7 inches. If you add the hypotenuse of the triangle the perimeter of the triangle becomes 7 + 5 = 12 inches.
The answer: 12

Question: Elliott drew a right-angle triangle on his book. It had a base of 4 inches, a height of 3 inches and a certain length of the hypotenuse. What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?

There are 80 - 13 = 67 cars in the parking lot after 13 went out. 13 + 5 = 18 cars went in the parking lot at lunchtime. So, there are 67 + 18 = 85 cars in the parking lot now.
The answer: 85
Reverse engineering the question: There were 80 cars in a parking lot. At lunchtime, 13 cars left the parking lot but 5 more cars went in than left. How many cars are in the parking lot now?

If Emani has $150, Howard has $150 - $30 = $120. In total, they have $120 + $150 = $270. When they share this money equally, each gets $270 / 2 people = $135 / person.
The answer: 135
