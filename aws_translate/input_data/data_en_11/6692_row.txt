Q: Question: In what state did McAtee play professional hockey in the NHL? Passage 1:Channel 11, as KFJZ-TV, first signed on the air at 2:30 p.m. on September 11, 1955, after a launch ceremony culminating in Fort Worth oilman Sid Richardson flipping the ceremonial switch to activate the transmitter. It was the first independent station to sign on in Texas, the fourth television station to sign on in the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex (after NBC affiliate WBAP-TV (channel 5, now KXAS-TV), which signed on the air on September 29, 1948; ABC affiliate KBTV (channel 8, now WFAA), which debuted on September 17, 1949; and CBS affiliate KRLD-TV (channel 4, now Fox owned-and-operated station KDFW), which debuted on December 3, 1949), and the first to debut in the market since the FCC's 1952 lifting of a four-year freeze on new applications for television station licenses. Originally, Channel 11 maintained a 9½-hour per day programming schedule, starting with its sign-on at 2:30 p.m. and concluding at its midnight sign-off. The station originally operated from facilities at 4801 West Freeway (in the present-day location of Interstate 30) in Fort Worth.
 Passage 2:Norman Joseph McAtee (June 28, 1921 – August 25, 2010) was a professional ice hockey player who played 13 games in the National Hockey League with the Boston Bruins. Born in Stratford, Ontario, he and his brother Jud played together in junior ice hockey with the Oshawa Generals during the years when the Generals dominated the Ontario Hockey League, winning championships with them in 1938–39. 1939–40 and 1940–41. At the end of the 1941 season, Norm joined his brother by signing as a free agent with the Detroit Red Wings in the NHL. However, beginning in 1942 and lasting throughout World War II, Norm became a flying officer in the Royal Canadian Air Force. After his discharge in 1945, he teamed with his brother in the Red Wings farm system before the two of them were traded to the Chicago Blackhawks for Doug McCaig in December 1945. Just over a month later, Chicago traded him to Boston for Bill Jennings, and Norm joined the Bruins for 13 games, recording one assist. After that, he finished his career in the minor leagues, ending as player-coach with the Troy Bruins in Troy, Ohio from 1951 to 1954.
 Passage 3:The copper ore deposits are those of a typical copper porphyry and associated alteration-mineralization. These altered zones include chalcopyrite, pyrite, bornite and molybdenite as hypogene minerals and chalcocite as a supergene mineral. The ore body surrounds the Braden Pipe in a continuous ring with a width of 2000 feet. The pipe is a geologic structure in the shape of an inverted cone, having a surface diameter of 4000 feet, and consisting of post-pipe breccia called the Braden Formation. The boundary of the pipe is marked by this post-pipe breccia and a pre-pipe breccia forming a belt up to 200 feet wide. "The Braden Pipe was a center of strong mineralization and structural weakness before the pipe was formed." Copper mineralization and pipe formation occurred in the Pliocene. Ore was originally mined from the Fortuna orebody at the southwest quadrant starting in 1906. Since 1922, the larger Teniente orebody has also been mined on the east side. "The best grade of ore is found in altered andesite or in andesitic flow breccia adjacent to the pre-pipe breccia."
