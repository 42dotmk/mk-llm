No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. The first question deals with feelings of self-worth and relationships, while the second question is about career choice and personal interests. I'll answer them separately for clarity.

1. What is the best way to stop feeling wrong about being a single girl who is successful but yearns for a good relationship?

It is important to understand that there is nothing wrong with being a single and successful woman who wants a fulfilling relationship. Society may sometimes pressure people to conform to certain expectations regarding relationships and success, but you are allowed to define happiness and satisfaction for yourself. Here are some suggestions for embracing your current status and overcoming any feelings of inadequacy:

a. Recognize your accomplishments: Acknowledge your professional achievements and personal growth. This will help boost your self-esteem and remind you that you have worked hard to reach where you are today.

b. Develop a supportive social circle: Surround yourself with friends and loved ones who understand and support your values and aspirations. They can be your anchors during times of self-doubt and remind you of your worth.

c. Enjoy your independence: Being single offers opportunities to explore hobbies, passions, and interests on your own terms. Engage in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment, and develop a deeper relationship with yourself in the process.

d. Embrace the journey: Yearning for a good relationship is natural, but remember not to view it as the ultimate end goal. Focus on your emotional well-being and personal fulfilment, irrespective of your relationship status. Trust that the right person will come along when the time is right.

e. Seek professional help if necessary: If feelings of inadequacy persist, consider speaking to a therapist or counselor. They can offer guidance and support in dealing with any emotional obstacles you might be facing.

2. Do you think it's advisable to do a chartered A/C if you have nothing else to do (knowing you won't find it interesting at all)?

It's essential to remember that career choices significantly impact your overall well-being and satisfaction in life. Choosing a profession solely because you have nothing else to do is not advisable, especially if you have no interest in it. Here are some things to keep in mind while weighing your options:

a. Identify your interests and strengths: Reflect on the subjects and tasks that have truly captured your interest in the past and align them with your natural skills. This will help you find a field that you are truly passionate about.

b. Research different industries and career paths: Explore various fields and professions, and try to find a career that suits both your interests and your values. Networking, mentorships, internships, or informational interviews can provide invaluable insights.

c. Invest in education and skills development: Pursuing further education, vocational training, or professional certifications in your field of interest will help you gain the necessary knowledge and expertise for your desired profession.

d. Be open to change and growth: Be prepared to adapt to new opportunities and challenges in your professional journey. Every experience contributes to your personal and professional development.

In conclusion, it is crucial to value your personal and professional happiness, and you deserve to feel good about your achievements and your desires. As you navigate these decisions, always prioritize your well-being, personal growth, and long-term satisfaction.
