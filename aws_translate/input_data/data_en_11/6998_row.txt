Reasoning and answer: There are two walls that are 12' X 10' and two walls that are 16' by 10'. First find the size in square feet of one 12' x 10' wall by multiplying the height and length: 12 ft * 10 ft = 120 sq ft. Multiply that quantity by 2 since there are two 12' x 10' walls: 120 sq ft * 2 = 240 sq ft. Then find the size in square feet of one 16' x 10' wall by multiplying the height and length: 16 ft * 10 ft = 160 sq ft. Multiply that quantity by 2 since there are two 16' x 10' walls: 160 sq ft * 2 = 320 sq ft. Now add the square footage of both sets of walls to find the total square footage Martha needs to paint: 240 sq ft + 320 sq ft = 560 sq ft. Now multiply that amount by 3 because Martha needs to add 3 coats: 560 sq ft / coat * 3 coats = 1680 sq ft. Finally, divide the total square footage by Martha's painting rate to find how many hours she needs to finish: 1680 sq ft / 40 sq ft / hour = 42 hours.
The answer: 42

Question: Martha needs to paint all four walls in her 12 foot by 16 foot kitchen, which has 10 foot high ceilings. Each wall needs one coat of primer and two coats of paint. If Martha can paint 40 square feet per hour, how many hours will it take her to paint the kitchen?

Andrew’s guest bedroom took 8 - 2 = 6 wooden planks. His hallways took 2 * 4 = 8 planks. In two bedrooms, he ruined 3 planks each, so the bedrooms took an extra 3 * 2 = 6 planks. In all, he used 8 + 20 + 11 + 6 + 8 + 6 = 59 planks for his whole house. Andrew had 6 leftover planks, so he bought 59 + 6 = 65 wooden planks to start with.
The answer: 65
Reverse engineering the question: Andrew installed hardwood flooring in his house. His bedroom took eight wooden planks, his living room took twenty planks, and his kitchen took eleven planks. The guest bedroom took two fewer planks than Andrew’s bedroom, and each of his two hallways took four planks. He accidentally ruined three planks in each bedroom by dragging furniture over them and had to replace them. He ended up with six leftover planks at the end. How many wooden planks did Andrew buy to start with?

Reasoning and answer: Brenda is 22 + 15 = 37 points ahead after her play. Then she is 37 - 32 = 5 points ahead.

He had 8 / 2 = 4 left after giving some puppies away. He then keeps one so he sells 4 - 1 = 3 puppies. That means he made 3 * 600 = $1800. So his profit was 1800 - 300 = $1500.
The answer: 1500
Reverse engineering the question: John's dog has a litter of 8 puppies. He gives away half of them. He keeps one of the remaining puppies. He then takes the remaining puppies and sells them each for $600. He had to give the owner of the stud $300. How much money does he profit?

Reasoning and answer: John wants to buy 15 packets of chips, which will cost him 15 * 2 = $30. So John would have 45 - 30 = $15 left for the corn chips. John could buy for the rest of the money 15 / 1.5 = 10 packets of corn chips.
The answer: 10
