Title: Before Eternity

Genre: Romantic Fantasy Drama

Plot:

Act 1:

The story begins in the rainy town of Forks, Washington. Bella, an introverted and curious teenager, moves from the sunny state of Arizona to Forks, where she lives with her father, Charlie. Bella starts attending the local high school where she attracts a lot of attention, both due to her newness and her captivating beauty. There, she meets and forms a connection with the mysterious, handsome, and aloof Edward Cullen.

Edward, being a vampire, tries to keep his distance from Bella to ensure her safety and hide his true identity. However, Bella's determination and her innate magnetism make it impossible for Edward to stay away. Bella soon discovers what Edward truly is, but despite the potential danger, her feelings for him only grow stronger.

Act 2:

As their relationship develops, Bella discovers that Edward's entire vampire family abstains from human blood, surviving by consuming animal blood instead. After spending more time together, Bella expresses her desire to become a vampire so she can be with Edward forever. Edward, however, firmly refuses.

While dealing with her desires and ambition to become a vampire, Bella starts to realize that she hasn't fully experienced her human life. After discussing the matter with Edward, he makes a deal with her: he will turn her into a vampire, but only after they get married and only if she agrees to live her life more fully as a human before their marriage.

Bella agrees to Edward's conditions and embarks on a journey of self-discovery. With Edward by her side, she starts making a "human experience" bucket list that includes activities like rock climbing, attending prom, traveling the world, and pursuing higher studies. Edward, who has experienced many adventurous human experiences throughout his immortal life, shares his vast knowledge with Bella, helping her understand the importance of cherishing these moments.

Act 3:

As Bella embraces her human experiences, she starts to better appreciate the complexity of life and human emotions. She begins to understand that the journey to becoming a vampire is not just about losing her human mortality but also leaving behind a valuable portion of her humanity.

Over time, Bella forms stronger bonds with her family, friends, and Edward's vampire family. As her wedding day approaches, Bella becomes increasingly conflicted. Should she give up her human life and all its memories, or should she remain mortal and accept the potential consequences of growing old and eventually parting ways with Edward?

In the climax, Bella decides to follow through with marrying Edward, but both she and Edward grow more hesitant about their decision of turning her into a vampire. Ultimately, they decide to postpone her transformation and make the most of their love and each day together.

Epilogue:

Embracing their present experiences, Edward and Bella continue to enrich their lives by making new memories, discovering more about the human world, and strengthening their love. While the hurdle of mortality still looms over their relationship, Edward and Bella find happiness in cherishing the time they can share, proving that living in the present moment is the most beautiful journey of all.

"Before Eternity" transcends typical romance by blending supernatural elements with a deep exploration of the human experience. It evokes themes of love, mortality, personal growth, and the importance of cherishing life's fleeting moments whilst navigating the complex emotions and ethical concerns that emerge from a unique bond between human and vampire.
