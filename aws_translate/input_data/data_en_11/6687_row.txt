Question: Chrisâ€™s internet bill is $45 per month for 100 GB and $0.25 for every 1 GB over. His bill for this month is $65. How many GB over was Chris charged for on this bill?
Answer: Let G stand for the number of GB billed, so the total bill is $0.25G + $45 flat rate charge = $65 total bill. Now we will solve for G. $0.25G + $45 flat rate - $45 = $65 - $45. This simplifies to $0.25G = $20. $0.25G / $0.25 = $20 / $0.25. G = 80 GB were charged on this bill. The answer is 80.
[Question]Five shirts together cost $85. Of the 5 shirts, there are 3 shirts that cost $15 each. If the remaining shirts are each equal in value, what is the cost, in dollars, of one of the remaining shirts?
[Answer]The first 3 shirts cost 15 * 3 = 45 dollars in total. There are 5 - 3 = 2 shirts remaining. The remaining 2 shirts cost 85 - 45 = 40 dollars in total. One of the remaining shirts costs 40 / 2 = 20 dollars. The answer is 20.
Q: Whenever Katie and her family eat donuts, they need some coffee to dunk them in. She notices that for each donut they need 2 ounces of coffee. Every pot of coffee she makes contains 12 ounces and costs $3 to make. If her family finishes 3 dozen donuts, how much do they spend on coffee?
A: He family eats 36 donuts because 3 x 12 = 36. They need 72 ounces of coffee for these because 2 x 36 = 72. This is equal to six pots of coffee because 72 / 12 = 6. This will cost $18 to make because 6 x 3 = 18. The answer is 18.
Question: Linda was going to pass out homemade cookies to each of her 24 classmates on the last day of school. She wanted to give each student 10 cookies and wanted to make chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal raisin cookies. Each cookie recipe made exactly 4 dozen cookies. She was able to make 2 batches of chocolate chip cookies before running out of chocolate chips. She made 1 batch of oatmeal raisin cookies. How many more batches of cookies does Linda need to bake?
Answer: She has 24 classmates and wants to give each 10 cookies, so she needs to bake 24 * 10 = 240 cookies. Each batch makes 4 dozen cookies so that means each batch has 4 * 12 = 48 cookies. She baked 2 batches of chocolate chip and one batch of oatmeal raisin so 2 + 1 = 3 batches. We know that each batch has 48 cookies so 3 * 48 = 144 cookies have been baked. She needs to have 240 cookies and has baked 144 so 240 - 144 = 96 cookies are needed. Again, each batch makes 48 cookies and we need 96 more cookies so 96 / 48 = 2 more batches are needed. The answer is 2.
[Question]After receiving the $2000 stimulus check, Mr. Eithan decided to share the amount with his family. He gave 2/5 of the amount to his wife, 2/5 of the remaining amount to his first son, 40% of the remaining amount to his second son, and kept the remaining in their family savings account. Calculate the total amount he kept in the family's savings account.
[Answer]The total amount of money Mr. Eithan gave to his wife is 2 / 5 * 2000 = $800. After giving his wife $800, he remained with $2000 - $800 = $1200. He gave his first son 2 / 5 of the remaining amount which is 2 / 5 * $1200 = $480. The total amount remaining after he gave his first 2 / 5 of the amount is $1200 - $480 = $720. He then gave his second son 40 / 100 * 720 = $288 of the money. After giving his second son $288, the amount of money remaining that he saved in the family's saving account is $720 - $288 = $432. The answer is 432.
