The Government of India Act
In 1919, a committee chaired by the Marquess of Crewe determined there existed the need to separate the agency work of the India Office from its other political and administrative roles, and recommended the transfer of all such work to "a High Commissioner for India or some similar Indian Governmental Representative in London." It was also felt popular opinion in India would view this as a step towards full Dominion status for India. The Government of India Act that same year upheld the recommendations of the committee, making provision for "the appointment of a High Commissioner by His Majesty by Order in Council, which might delegate to the official any of the contractual powers of the Secretary of State (for India) in Council, and prescribe the conditions under which he should act on behalf of the Government of India or any Provincial Government."

Passage: The three main playable characters in Grand Theft Auto V are Michael De Santa, a retired former bank robber who lives with his dysfunctional family on the proceeds of his former life; Franklin Clinton, a gang member who makes a living as a repo man for an unscrupulous Armenian car dealership; and Trevor Philips, Michael's former partner in crime, who lives alone in a trailer in the desert, where his reckless and psychotic behaviours are fuelled by drug addiction. The three acquaintances are drawn into Los Santos' criminal underworld "in the pursuit of the almighty American dollar". According to Houser, each of the protagonists is unlike any primary character that has appeared in a Grand Theft Auto title to date: Michael represents a protagonist who "won" in life, and is now trying to adjust to a normal one after his story has come to an end; Trevor is a supporting character recast as a central protagonist; and Franklin is someone who has had no real exposure to a life of crime until the events of the game, and his attempts to avoid such a life end up thrusting him into the middle of it.
