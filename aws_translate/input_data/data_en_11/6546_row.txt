The sentence provided does not directly answer the question "What event led Eisenhower to want to improve highways in the US?" The sentence does, however, mention Eisenhower's recognition of the improved ability to move logistics throughout the country and his belief that an Interstate Highway System would benefit both military operations and economic growth. To give a detailed and long answer, we need to delve into the historical context and events surrounding Eisenhower's push for the Interstate Highway System.

The actual event that led President Eisenhower to want to improve highways in the United States can be traced back to two key experiences in his life. The first experience was his participation in the U.S Army's 1919 Transcontinental Motor Convoy, and the second was his exposure to the efficient German Autobahn during World War II.

1. 1919 Transcontinental Motor Convoy:

In the summer of 1919, a young Dwight D. Eisenhower, then a Lt. Colonel, took part in the U.S. Army's Transcontinental Motor Convoy. This convoy was an ambitious military exercise to test the viability of transporting troops, vehicles, and equipment across the United States. The journey began in Washington, D.C. and ended in San Francisco, California, covering approximately 3,251 miles. The mission intended to assess the state of American roads, their suitability for military purposes, and the challenges that might arise during a large-scale, cross-country military operation.

Throughout the journey, the convoy encountered numerous problems due to the poor condition of American roads at that time. They faced impassable stretches of dirt roads, broken bridges, and treacherous terrain, which caused multiple delays and vehicle breakdowns. This experience made a lasting impression on Eisenhower, highlighting the importance of a well-built and maintained highway system for both military and civilian purposes.

2. The German Autobahn during World War II:

Fast-forward to World War II, where Eisenhower served as the Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe. Here, he observed the strategic advantages of the German Autobahn. The Autobahn, a high-quality and extensive network of highways that crisscrossed Germany, allowed for efficient and rapid transportation of troops, vehicles, and supplies. The German's superior infrastructure provided a stark contrast to the inadequate road system Eisenhower had experienced in the United States.

These two key experiences provided the impetus for Eisenhower's push to improve highways in the United States. Once he became President in 1953, he made it one of his administration's priorities to address the nation's infrastructure shortcomings. These efforts culminated in the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, which authorized the construction of the United States Interstate Highway System, a 41,000-mile network of highways aimed at improving military mobility and fostering economic growth. The Act allocated substantial funding, laid out the framework for the highway system, and established a program to oversee its implementation.

In conclusion, the sentence provided offers a glimpse into Eisenhower's thought process surrounding the creation of the Interstate Highway System, but it does not directly answer the question about the events that led to his interest in improving American highways. The actual answer lies in the combination of his experience with the 1919 Transcontinental Motor Convoy and his exposure to the German Autobahn during World War II, both of which revealed the critical need for a better highway system in the United States.
