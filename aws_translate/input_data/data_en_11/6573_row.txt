Question: A mosquito sucks 20 drops of blood every time it feeds on someone. If there are 5000 drops per liter and you have to lose 3 liters of blood to die, how many mosquitoes would have to feed on you to kill you?
Answer: First find the total number of liters a mosquito sucks in one feeding: 20 drops / 5000 drops / liter = .004 L / feeding. Then divide the lethal amount of blood by the amount of blood one mosquito can drain: 3 L / .004 L / feeding = 750 feedings. The answer is 750.
[Question]Rita is reading a five-chapter book with 95 pages. Each chapter has three pages more than the previous one. How many pages does the first chapter have?
[Answer]Let P be the number of pages in the first chapter. The second chapter has P + 3 pages. The third chapter has P + 3 + 3 = P + 6 pages. The fourth chapter has P + 6 + 3 = P + 9 pages. The fifth chapter has P + 9 + 3 = P + 12 pages. The whole book has P + 3 + P + 6 + P + 9 + P + 12 = 5P + 30 = 95 pages. Thus, without the 30 extra pages from additional chapters, 5P = 95 - 30 = 65 pages. Therefore, the first chapter had P = 65 / 5 = 13 pages. The answer is 13.
Q: In seven years, Talia will be 20 years old. Talia's mom is currently three times as old as Talia is today. In three years, Talia's father will be the same age as Talia's mom is today. Currently, how many years old is Talia's father?
A: In seven years, Talia will be 20 years old, and therefore Talia is currently 20 - 7 = 13 years old. Talia's mom is currently three times as old as Talia is today, or 3 * 13 = 39 years old. If in three years, Talia's father will be the same age as Talia's mom is today, then Talia's father is currently 39 - 3 = 36 years old. The answer is 36.
Question: Carla's brush is 12 inches long. If Carmen's brush is 50% longer than Carla's brush, how long is Carmen's brush in centimeters? (There are 2.5 centimeters per inch.)
Answer: First find the length of Carmen's brush in inches: 150% * 12 inches = 18 inches. Then convert the length from inches to centimeters: 18 inches * 2.5 centimeters / inch = 45 centimeters. The answer is 45.
[Question]Bill is buying healthcare on an exchange. The normal monthly price of the plan he wants is $500. The government will pay for part of this cost depending on Bill's income: 90% if he makes less than $10,000, 50% if he makes between $10,001 and $40,000, and 20% if he makes more than $50,000. Bill earns $25/hour and works 30 hours per week, four weeks per month. How much will Bill spend for health insurance in a year?
[Answer]First find how much money Bill makes every week by multiplying his hourly rate by the number of hours he works each week: $25 / hour * 30 hours / week = $750 / week. Then multiply that number by the number of weeks per month to find his monthly earnings: $750 / week * 4 weeks / month = $3,000 / month. Then multiply his monthly earnings by the number of months in a year to find his annual income: $3,000 / month * 12 months / year = $36,000 / year. This income means Bill gets a 50% monthly healthcare subsidy from the government. Multiply the cost of the premium by 50% to find the monthly cost Bill pays: $500 / month * .5 = $250 / month. Finally, multiply Bill's monthly cost by the number of months in a year to find his annual cost: $250 / month * 12 months / year = $3,000 / year. The answer is 3000.
