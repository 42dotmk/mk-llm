Rachel could act as though they cared about something they did not whereas Mary could not, primarily because of their contrasting personality traits and their differing levels of emotional intelligence.

To begin with, we need to address the given statements:

i. Rachel was very honest. This statement appears to be contradictory to the initial claim as Rachel is able to act insincerely regarding her care for something. This could indicate that Rachel's honesty is selective, meaning she has the ability to portray an honest appearance in certain situations while still being able to act differently from her true feelings. For her, honesty is not an intrinsic value but instead, a situational tool used to achieve specific goals.

ii. Mary was very honest. Contrary to Rachel, Mary has an inherent attribute of honesty, which means she cannot feign concern over a topic she does not genuinely care about. Her honesty prevents her from pretending to be interested in something, even if it would be beneficial for her to do so.

Furthermore, there are additional factors that contribute to these differences between Rachel and Mary. It is important to examine aspects such as emotional intelligence, self-awareness, their differing values, and social skills. 

Emotional intelligence refers to an individual's capacity to recognize, interpret, manage, and utilize emotions in oneself and others. With a higher emotional intelligence, Rachel can easier identify her own emotions and the emotions of those around her, enabling her to act in a way that may not be entirely sincere but will benefit her in various interpersonal situations. Rachel has the ability to manipulate the expressions of emotions in order to achieve desired outcomes.

On the other hand, Mary, who may possess a lower emotional intelligence, struggles to fake emotions that she does not genuinely experience. Her innate honesty shapes her interactions with others and prevents her from being able to artificially engage in a manner that does not align with her true feelings.

Moving on, self-awareness is another factor that could influence this difference between the two. Rachel's self-awareness may allow her to be conscious of her actions' impact on others, giving her the ability to act in certain ways, such as feigning interest or concern, when she deems it socially appropriate or advantageous. Meanwhile, Mary may lack this level of self-awareness, which makes her behaviour more transparent and genuine.

Lastly, social skills play an essential role in this situation. Rachel may have developed advanced social skills that enable her to interact with others according to the expectations of her environment. This could involve code-switching, where she adjusts her behaviour to align with the social context in which she finds herself. Mary, conversely, might have underdeveloped social skills that result in her interacting with others solely based on her authentic internal emotional responses.

In summary, Rachel's ability to act as though they cared about something they did not whereas Mary could not is attributable to their divergent personalities, emotional intelligence levels, varying degrees of self-awareness, and social skill development. Because of these factors, Rachel can effectively adapt her behaviour to the expectations and demands of her environment, even when it requires her to behave contrary to her actual feelings. In contrast, Mary's innate honesty, coupled with her potentially lower emotional intelligence and self-awareness, make her incapable of acting insincerely when she does not truly care about something.
