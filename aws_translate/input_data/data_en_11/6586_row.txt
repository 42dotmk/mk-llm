[Question]If olivine has 5 more precious stones than agate and diamond has 11 more precious stones than olivine, how many precious stones do they have together if agate has 30 precious stones?
[Answer]Since Agate has 30 precious stones and Olivine has 5 more precious stones, then Olivine has 30 + 5 = 35 precious stones. The total number of stones Olivine and Agate has is 35 + 30 = 65. Diamond has 11 more precious stones than Olivine, who has 35 stones, meaning Diamond has 35 + 11 = 46 precious stones. In total, they all have 65 + 46 = 111 precious stones. The answer is 111.
Q: Emma is 7 years old. If her sister is 9 years older than her, how old will Emma be when her sister is 56?
A: Emma’s sister is 7 + 9 = 16 years old. In this many years, Emma’s sister will be 56 years old: 56 - 16 = 40 years. When her sister is 56 years old, Emma will be 7 + 40 = 47 years. The answer is 47.
Question: Keanu was surfing towards the shore at a speed of 20 miles per hour. A shark was swimming alongside him, riding the same wave, when it doubled its speed and moved away from Keanu. There was a pilot fish swimming alongside Keanu and the shark, and when the shark increased its speed, the pilot fish also increased its speed and moved away from Keanu, but only increasing its speed by half as much as the shark had increased its speed by. What speed, in miles per hour, was the pilot fish swimming when it moved away from Keanu?
Answer: The shark went from 20 miles per hour to a speed of 2 * 20 = 40 miles per hour. The shark increased its speed by 40 - 20 = 20 miles per hour. Half of the shark's increase in speed is 20 / 2 = 10 miles per hour. Thus the pilot fish had increased its speed to 20 + 10 = 30 miles per hour. The answer is 30.
[Question]Janet hires six employees. Four of them are warehouse workers who make $15/hour, and the other two are managers who make $20/hour. Janet has to pay 10% of her workers' salaries in FICA taxes. If everyone works 25 days a month and 8 hours a day, how much does Janet owe total for their wages and taxes for one month?
[Answer]First figure out how many hours each worker works per month by multiplying the number of days they work by the number of hours a day they work: 25 days * 8 hours / day = 200 hours. Then calculate how much one warehouse worker makes per month by multiplying their hourly rate by the number of hours they work: 200 hours * $15 / hour = $3000. Then multiply that number by 4 to find out how much all the warehouse workers make: $3000 / worker * 4 workers = $12,000. Now multiply the hours each manager works (also 200) by their hourly wage to find out how much one manager makes per month: 200 hours * $20 / hour = $4,000. Now multiply one manager's wages by the number of managers (2) to find their total wage amount: $4,000 / manager * 2 managers = $8,000. Now add the wages for the managers and the workers to find the total cost of the wages: $8,000 + $12,000 = $20,000. Now multiply the total wage bill by 10% to find how much the FICA taxes are: $20,000 * .1 = $2,000. Now add the total wage bill to the total tax amount to find the grand total: $2,000 + $20,000 = $22,000. The answer is 22000.
Q: Emma got $2000 from the bank. She bought $400 of furniture and gave 3/4 of the rest to her friend Anna. How much is left with Emma?
A: Emma had $2000 - $400 = $1600 left after buying furniture. Emma gave Anna 3 / 4 * $1600 = $1200. So, Emma is left with $1600 - $1200 = $400. The answer is 400.
