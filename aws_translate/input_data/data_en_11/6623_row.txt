1). No, these questions do not have the same meaning.

The first question is focused on the biological aspect of the nocturnal flowers and seeks to understand the internal mechanisms that cause them to bloom at night. It is specifically interested in the physiological and genetic factors that enable these plants to exhibit this distinct behavior.

Answer to the first question:

Nocturnal flowers open their blooms at night due to a set of internal mechanisms and genetic factors. These factors consist primarily of circadian rhythms, phytohormones, and the genes responsible for the nocturnal behavior of plants.

Circadian rhythms are biological processes that follow a 24-hour cycle, allowing organisms to adapt to the daily cycles of light and darkness. Plant circadian rhythms control various aspects of growth, including the opening and closing of flowers. In nocturnal flowers, their circadian rhythms are regulated in such a way that they promote blooming during the nighttime hours.

Phytohormones (plant hormones) play a significant role in the blooming of flowers. These hormones, such as auxins, gibberellins, and abscisic acid, help regulate the processes that ultimately lead to flowers opening and closing. In nocturnal flowers, the balance and interactions between these hormones are modulated to promote nighttime blooming.

Lastly, the genetic factors responsible for the nocturnal behavior of flowers lie in specific genes that control their daily rhythms. These specific genes and their expressions, under the influence of external factors such as light quality and temperature, coordinate the plant's circadian rhythms and promote nighttime blooming.

The second question is centered on the social, cultural, and economic aspects of the Roma people in Europe. It aims to understand both external and internal factors that have contributed to their consistently high rates of poverty compared to the 'natives.'

Answer to the second question:

The Roma people in Europe have consistently experienced high rates of poverty due to a complex interplay of external and internal factors. These factors can be broadly categorized into social, cultural, economic, and political aspects.

External factors:

1. Discrimination and prejudice: The Roma people have faced long-standing discrimination and prejudice throughout history. This marginalization has limited their access to education, healthcare, housing, and employment opportunities, perpetuating the cycle of poverty.

2. Integration challenges: Due to their nomadic lifestyle, language barriers, and cultural differences, the Roma people often face difficulties integrating into mainstream society. This contributes to the isolation and discrimination that they experience, which further exacerbates their economic status.

Internal factors:

1. Traditional lifestyle and values: Some Roma communities adhere to a traditional lifestyle that may not prioritize formal education or steady employment. This can create challenges when attempting to integrate into a modern, competitive economy.

2. Access to resources and support: In some cases, Roma communities may have limited access to resources and support systems within their own community or from external sources. This disadvantage can hinder social and economic mobility, perpetuating poverty within the Roma population.

Though these questions are both examining causes of different phenomena, they are not exploring the same meaning or topic. One question is related to the science of nocturnal plant biology, while the other investigates societal issues concerning the Roma people in Europe.
