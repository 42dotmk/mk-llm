Kansas, surrounded by the familiar sights and sounds of the small town where I grew up. I longed for the comfort of my family, the laughter of my friends, and the homecooked meals that my maw used to make. Wichita had been an exciting adventure, but now, all I could think about was how much I missed the simple pleasures of my former life. I wondered if the distance I had created through my pursuit of these city experiences had not only taken me far away from my roots, but also who I really was.

As I walked through the city streets, the bustling commotion of people, cars, and flashing lights felt overwhelming. I craved the crisp, clean air of the Kansas plains and the rustic charm of the rolling wheat fields. In the back of my mind, I could hear my maw warning me that this detour might change the course of my existence forever. The incessant consumption of hamburgers had become symbolic of the deeper void I was trying to fill - one of longing for connection, belonging, and the embrace of those who knew me best and loved me without judgment.

When I moved to Wichita, I thought I was chasing my dreams and escaping the limitations of my small-town existence. I had imagined a life of opportunity, growth, and excitement. Instead, I found myself tethered to a lifestyle that felt empty and shallow. My days were filled with meaningless interactions, my nights spent seeking solace in the greasy satisfaction of one hamburger after another.

As I reflected on the past few months, I found it increasingly difficult to deny the truth: my life in Wichita was a far cry from what I had envisioned. I couldn't help but think that my maw's worries may have held some wisdom. With each hamburger I devoured, I could feel myself slipping further into a world that I neither recognized nor enjoyed. As the pull of my Kansas home grew stronger each day, I wondered if it was time to find my way backâ€”before it was too late.

I decided it was time to take control of my life again and rediscover the person I was before Wichita had taken hold of me. I started by cutting back on the hamburgers, reintroducing healthier foods, and gradually restoring balance to my diet. I also began reaching out to old friends and family members, ensuring that I stayed connected to the warmth and love that I had left behind in pursuit of my "big city" dreams.

With each day that passed, I found myself growing more confident in my decision to return to my roots. I believed that I could find contentment in the simple joys of life, with the people who loved and understood me. Although the journey wouldn't be an easy one, I felt that it was a necessary step toward rediscovering happiness and a life filled with purpose.

So, I packed my bags, said my goodbyes to Wichita, and returned to Kansas, knowing that while this chapter of my life was coming to a close, another awaited me with open arms. As I reconnected with my maw, family, and friends, I found myself quickly wrapped up in the warmth of their love, and a deep sense of belonging that had eluded me in the city. It wasn't long before I realized that I had made the right choice - to come back home, where the simple life and genuine connections with others were worth more than any flashy, urban lifestyle could ever offer.

And while the temptation of a hamburger may still linger from time to time, I soon learned that there was a certain satisfaction that comes from a wholesome, homecooked meal - one that no city experience could ever hope to replace. Because at the end of the day, family and connection, and remaining true to one's self, are what truly make life meaningful and fulfilling.
