Question: At camp Wonka, there are 96 campers. Two-thirds of the campers are boys, and the remaining one-third are girls. 50% of the boys want to toast marshmallows and 75% of the girls want to toast marshmallows. If each camper gets one marshmallow to toast, how many marshmallows do they need?
Answer: The girls make up one - third of the campers, so there are 96 / 3 = 32 girls. The boys make up two - thirds of the campers, so there are 32 + 32 = 64 boys. There are 32 x 75% = 24 girls who want to toast marshmallows. There are 64 x 50% = 32 boys who want to toast marshmallows. They need 24 + 32 = 56 marshmallows. The answer is 56.
[Question]A small airplane can seat 10 people in first class, 30 in business class, and 50 in economy class seating. If economy class is half full, and business class and first class have the same number of people together as economy class, how many seats are unoccupied in business class if only three people on the flight have first class seats?
[Answer]There are 50 / 2 = 25 people in economy class. There are 25 people in business first and business class, so there are 25 - 3 = 22 in business class. Thus, there are 30 - 22 = 8 unoccupied seats in business class. The answer is 8.
Q: James sells a $500,000 house for 20% over market value. He splits the revenue with his 3 brothers. How much does each person get after taxes take away 10%?
A: He sells the house for 1 + .2 = 1.2 times its value. So he sells the house for 500,000 * 1.2 = 600,000. He splits the money 1 + 3 = 4 ways. So each person gets 600,000 / 4 = $150,000 before taxes. Taxes take away 150,000 * .1 = $15,000. So each person gets 150,000 - 15,000 = $135,000. The answer is 135000.
Question: To raise funds for her local soup kitchen, Didi enlisted the help of her family, friends, and neighbors. They donated 10 same-size cakes that she sliced into 8 slices per cake and started selling a slice for $1. A local business owner was so impressed by Didi's efforts that she offered to donate 50 cents for each slice Didi sold. A second business owner also offered to donate a quarter for each slice sold. If Didi sold all the slices, how much money did she raise?
Answer: All the cakes yielded 10 * 8 = 80 slices. Since Didi was selling each slice for $1, it means she sold everything for 80 * 1 = 80 dollars. The first business owner donated 50 / 100 * 80 = 40 dollars. The second business owner donated 25 / 100 * 80 = 20 dollars. Adding both amounts gives 80 + 40 + 20 = 140 dollars. The answer is 140.
[Question]Christine and Janice are having a contest to see who can throw a ball the highest. They each get three throws. On her first throw, Christine throws it 20 feet high. Janice's throw is 4 feet lower than Christine's. On their second throw, Christine throws it ten feet higher than her first throw and Janice throws it twice as high as her first throw. On the final throw, Christine throws it 4 feet higher than her 2nd throw while Janice throws it 17 feet higher than Christine's first throw. What is the height of the highest throw?
[Answer]We know Christine's second throw was 30 feet high because 20 + 10 = 30. We know Christine's third throw was 34 feet because 30 + 4 = 34. Janice's first throw was 16 feet because 20 - 4 = 16. Janice's second throw was 32 feet because 16 * 2 = 32. Janice's final throw was 37 feet high because 20 + 17 = 37. The six throws were 20 feet, 30 feet, 34 feet, 16 feet, 32 feet, and 37 feet, and of these numbers, 37 feet was the highest. The answer is 37.
