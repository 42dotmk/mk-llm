They're three of the world's biggest superstars -- but few would have expected to see them together taking in a football match in Paris. Beyonce and her husband Jay-Z were the stars of the show in the French capital on Tuesday night after turning out to watch Paris Saint-Germain's stunning 3-2 win over Barcelona in the Champions League. While Lionel Messi and Neymar were busy scoring goals for Barca, in a losing cause, it was the celebrities in the stand which were capturing the attention of the photographers by the field. Most tourists visit the Eiffel Tower or take a stroll down the Champs Elysees, but Beyonce and her husband looked quite at home in the company of Beckham.
