Q: Hannah sold 40 pieces of cookies for $0.8 each and 30 cupcakes for $2 each. She used the money to buy 2 sets of measuring spoons for $6.5 each. How much money does she have left?
A: Hannah's earnings from the cookies is 40 x $0.8 = $32. Her earnings from the cupcakes is 30 x $2 = $60. Her total earnings for the cupcakes and cookies is $32 + $60 = $92. The cost of 2 sets of measuring spoons is 2 x $6.5 = $13. So, Hannah has $92 - $13 = $79. The answer is 79.
Question: During the holidays, Lance works as a merchandiser. He works 35 hours a week, spread equally over 5 workdays. If Lance earns $9 an hour, how much does he make on each workday?
Answer: Lance works 35 / 5 = 7 hours a day. So he makes $9 x 7 = $63 on each workday. The answer is 63.
[Question]James paves a new parking lot. It is 400 feet by 500 feet. Only 80% of that is useable for parking. It takes 10 square feet to park a car. How many cars can be parked?
[Answer]The parking lot is 400 * 500 = 200,000. There are 200,000 * .8 = 160,000 square feet of parking space. That means he can park 16,0000 / 10 = 16000 cars. The answer is 16000.
Q: Max works for a delivery company as a courier. During one working day, he can deliver a maximum of 35 packages. One week, Max delivered the maximum number of packages, only twice. On two other days, Max unloaded a total of 50 packages, and on one day he unloaded only one-seventh of the maximum possible daily performance. On the last two days, the sum of the packages transported was only fourth-fifth of the maximum daily performance. How many more packages could Max deliver during that week, if he would work at maximum performance?
A: Max can deliver a maximum of 35 * 7 = 245 packages in one week. For two days Max has carried the maximum number of packages, which in total means 2 * 35 = 70 packages. One day Max has carried only 1 / 7 of the maximum capacity, that is 1 / 7 * 35 = 5 packages. On two other days, Max delivered only 4 / 5 * 35 = 28 packages. That means, Max could deliver 245 - 28 - 5 - 70 - 50 = 92 more packages. The answer is 92.
Question: The Rotary Club is holding its annual fundraising Omelet Breakfast, with tickets sold in advance. The tickets come in different price levels, for young children, older children, adults, and seniors. This year they sold 53 small children tickets, 35 older children tickets, 75 adult tickets, and 37 senior tickets. To figure out how many eggs they need to buy, the club estimates that small children can eat a half omelet, older children can eat a whole omelet, adults will eat two omelets, and seniors will eat one and a half omelets. Just to be on the safe side, they get enough eggs to make 25 extra omelets. If they use 2 eggs for each omelet, how many eggs will they need to buy?
Answer: They'll need to make an estimated 0.5 * 53 = 26.5 omelets for small children. They'll need to make an estimated 1 * 35 = 35 omelets for older children. They'll need to make an estimated 2 * 75 = 150 omelets for the adults. And they'll need to make an estimated 1.5 * 37 = 55.5 omelets for the seniors. Along with the 25 extra omelets they'll make as a buffer, they will need enough eggs for 26.5 + 35 + 150 + 55.5 + 25 = 292 omelets. So they will need 2 * 292 = 584 eggs. The answer is 584.
