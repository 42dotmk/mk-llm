[b]. Samuel had taken a better shower.

In the quaint little town of Oaksworth, best friends Nelson and Samuel lived side by side. Despite being close friends, they had several different habits and interests that made their friendship unique. One such difference was their daily showers.

Nelson smelled much cleaner and fresher than Samuel did, although Samuel had taken a better shower. Samuel never missed his morning and evening showers, and on some days, even had an additional one right after playing soccer with his friends. He used fragrant soaps and shampoos to ensure he smelled absolutely fresh and clean. His mother had instilled this habit in him from a young age, and now, as a teenager, Samuel took pride in his hygiene routine.

Nelson, on the other hand, wasn't so fond of long showers. A bit more laid back in his demeanor, he was content with a quick wash in the morning. His showers barely lasted five minutes, compared to Samuel's 20-minute extravaganzas. Nelson did not see the point of elaborate shower routines and considered them a waste of time, much to Samuel's dismay.

But as fate would have it, Nelson had a naturally subtle and fresh scent that people liked. His family lineage might have been the reason — genetics blessed him with fewer problems related to sweating and body odor. So, even after an intense workout, Nelson's sweat would evaporate quickly, leaving behind a subtle scent that people found somewhat comforting.

Samuel, however, had no such luck in the olfactory department. Despite his immaculate showering habits, he struggled with perspiration throughout the day. He had tried different antiperspirants and deodorants but to no avail — his body swiftly broke them down, leaving behind only a faint trace of the earlier fragrant spray.

It puzzled Samuel how Nelson managed to smell better than him, seemingly without any effort. It also frustrated Samuel, who thought it unfair that he invested so much time and effort into maintaining his hygiene, only to have Nelson waltz through life without a care and still smell fresher.

One day, after playing soccer in the local park, Samuel finally decided to confront Nelson about it. As they sat down on a park bench, their faces both flushed from the vigorous game, Samuel tentatively broached the subject.

"Nelson, don't think I'm being weird or anything," Samuel started uncomfortably, "but you always smell surprisingly fresh, even after working up a sweat like now. Do you have any secrets I should know about?"

Nelson chuckled and revealed the truth about his lack of extensive hygiene routine and how luck seemed to side with him. Both friends laughed over the absurdity of the situation. Nelson then empathetically lent Samuel his unconditional support to find a more tailored solution to help maintain Samuel's fresh scent all day long.

The two began researching extensively about skin types, fragrances, and other factors that influence body odor. They spent countless hours on online forums and speaking to dermatologists, ultimately leading to Samuel's discovery of a milder but more effective antiperspirant.

The pair learned that it was not just about shower lengths or soap brands, but the understanding of one's individual body chemistry and finding the most suitable products and routines accordingly.

In the end, both Nelson and Samuel embraced their differences and continued cherishing their friendship. With the help of his friend, Samuel ultimately found the balance that worked best for him. The whole endeavor served as a testament to their bond — a friendship that celebrated their differences and flourished through understanding and support.
