[Question]Stephanie is checking her household budget, and needs to calculate how much she has left to pay for her bills. Her electricity bill costs $60, and this is paid in full. Her gas bill was $40, and she has already paid three-quarters of this. She makes another payment of $5 towards her gas bill while checking her budget. Her water bill is $40, which she has paid half of, and her internet bill is $25, which she has made 4 payments of $5 towards. Overall, how many dollars does Stephanie still need to pay to finish paying her bills?
[Answer]Stephanie has paid three - quarters of her gas bill, which is 40 * 0.75 = $30. She then made another payment, which means she has paid 30 + 5 = $35 of her gas bill. She has paid half of her water bill, which is 40 * 0.5 = $20. She has made 4 payments towards her internet bill, which is a total of 4 * 5 = $20. Overall, her bills were 60 + 40 + 40 + 25 = $165. Overall, she has made payments of 60 + 35 + 20 + 20 = $135. Therefore, she still has to pay 165 – 135 = $30. The answer is 30.
Q: Two-fifths of the seats in an auditorium that holds 500 people are currently taken. It was found that 1/10 of the seats are broken. How many seats are still available?
A: 500 / 2 / 5 = 200 seats are already taken. 500 / 1 / 10 = 50 seats are broken. So 200 + 50 = 250 seats are either taken or broken. Therefore, 500 - 250 = 250 seats are still available. The answer is 250.
Question: A laboratory needs flasks, test tubes, and safety gear to carry out its experiments. They were given a $325 budget for the month. They bought $150 worth of flasks, spent two-thirds of that amount on test tubes, and used half of the test tube cost on safety gear. How many dollars of their budget remained?
Answer: The laboratory spent 2 / 3 * 150 = 300 / 3 = $100 on test tubes. They spent a further 100 / 2 = $50 on safety gear. In all, they spent 150 + 100 + 50 = $300. Thus, 325 - 300 = $25 of the laboratory’s budget remained. The answer is 25.
[Question]Three times the sum of marbles that Atticus, Jensen, and Cruz have is equal to 60. If Atticus has half as many marbles as Jensen, and Atticus has 4 marbles, how many marbles does Cruz have?
[Answer]Three times the sum of marbles that Atticus, Jensen, and Cruz have is equal to 60, meaning together they have 60 / 3 = 20 marbles. If Atticus has half as many marbles as Jensen, and Atticus has four marbles, Jensen has 2 * 4 = 8 marbles. Together, Atticus and Jensen have 8 + 4 = 12 marbles. Since the sum of marbles that Atticus, Jensen, and Cruz have is equal to 20, and Atticus and Jensen have 12 marbles, Cruz has 20 - 12 = 8 marbles. The answer is 8.
Q: Viggo spent $80 on a shirt. He paid the shirt using $20 and $10 bills. If she gave the clerk one more $20 bill than $10 bills, how many $10 bills did he give?
A: Let x be the number of $10 bills. So, there are (x + 1) $20 bills. Adding the $10 and $20 bills should sum up to $80 so the equation is 10x + 20(x + 1) = 80. Then, distribute 20 to x + 1 so it becomes 10x + 20x + 20 = 80. Combining the like terms on the left side gives 30x + 20 = 80. Then transfer 20 to the right side of the equation, so it becomes 30x = 60. To solve for x, we have 60 / 30 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 $10 bills. The answer is 2.
Question: Annie is trying to figure out whether it's safe to drive her truck. For every 3 degrees the temperature drops below 32 degrees, Annie's chances of skidding on ice increase 5%. If she goes into a skid, she has a 40% of regaining control. Otherwise, she'll have a serious accident. If the temperature is 8 degrees, what is the percentage chance of Annie getting into a serious accident if she drives?
