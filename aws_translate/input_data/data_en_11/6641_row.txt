Once you've thoroughly evaluated your own strengths, follow these comprehensive steps that outline how to become an organizational development consultant:

1. **Education:** Firstly, hold a bachelor’s degree, often in business, psychology, or human resources. Some consultants also obtain a master’s degree in organizational development, business administration (MBA), or a similar field to increase their marketability and expertise. Certifications from endorsed professional bodies, such as the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), may also be a good idea.

2. **Gain Experience:** Most organizational development consultants have several years of work experience, usually in human resources, management, or corporate training. This experience provides an understanding of how businesses work and develop over time. Seek internships or entry-level positions in similar areas to gain this necessary experience.

3. **Develop Key Skills:** Organizational development consultants need excellent analytical skills to diagnose organizational problems and determine appropriate solutions. They also need good interpersonal and communication skills to work with personnel at all levels of an organization. Leadership skills are also vital in directing client organizations to the desired outcome.

4. **Understand Business Strategy:** It's essential that you refine your understanding of business strategy, change management, and the various methodologies and tools used in organizational development such as the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence or Lean Six Sigma, etc. This capability will help you create effective development strategies that are in line with your client's business objectives.

5. **Secure a Position:** You can start by looking for a job at a consulting firm to gain practical exposure and learn intricacies from experienced consultants. Here, you will have the opportunity to work on multiple projects across various industries, providing you with a broad remit of experience.

6. **Freelance Consulting:** After gaining robust experience, you may choose to become a freelance consultant, focusing on the areas you specialize in. This path gives you more control over the projects you accept and offers potentially higher earnings. However, it’s important to note that freelancing comes with its challenges, such as finding clients and handling more administrative tasks.

7. **Continuous Learning:** The business environment is constantly changing, and methods that worked previously might not work now. Therefore, staying updated on the latest trends, tools, and methodologies is crucial. Attend workshops, seminars, and pursue additional certifications to stay relevant in the field.

8. **Networking:** Build a strong network in the industry to keep a constant flow of opportunities. Attend industry events, join professional organizations, and collaborate with other professionals in the field. Clients often come through referrals, so it's crucial to connect with as many people as you can.

9. **Specialize:** As you gain experience, you may choose to specialize in a certain field or industry. A specialized consultant often has deeper insights into specific performance issues affecting an industry or operational area and can offer more tailored solutions.

Remember that becoming an organizational development consultant is a journey that will involve continuous learning and adaptation to new business environments and challenges. You'll need resourcefulness, resilience, and determination to navigate the various complexities involved in helping businesses improve and thrive.
