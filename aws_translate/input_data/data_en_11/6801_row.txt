Neil didn't think that Derrick should pay for the damage to their car, because Neil was at fault.

That cloudy Saturday afternoon, Neil and Derrick had been returning from a local basketball match. As always, they were both fully absorbed in discussing the game's highlights, dissecting each play and celebrating their team's victory. 

Neil was the driver, and Derrick the designated copilot. Due to their intense conversation, Neil didn't notice the sharp turn until it was too late. In an attempt to prevent their car from dipping into the adjacent ditch, he instinctively jerked the steering wheel too hard, causing him to lose control of the vehicle. The car drifted off the road, scraping against the thick, unforgiving branches of the dense hedgerows that lined the route.

They were both mostly unharmed but shaken by the incident. They had been fortunate that there was nobody else on the road at the time, but the impact of the car with the hedgerow had left significant damage, the scratches and dents on the car's bodywork attesting to the vehemence of the crash.

After assessing the extent of the damage, Derrick had suggested that they split the cost of the repairs. But Neil couldn't bear the thought of burdening his friend with additional expenses, especially since it was he who'd been behind the wheel. He tried to argue his case, insisting on taking full responsibility for the accident and bearing the brunt of the costs.

"I was the one driving, Derrick. Really, I should be the one to pay. If I had paid closer attention to the road, we wouldn't be caught in this situation," Neil explained, feeling his cheeks burn with embarrassment. 

Derrick, however, refused to give in. "Man, come on! We were both at fault here," he argued, clapping Neil on the back in a rare, vulnerable display of camaraderie. "You wouldn't be so distracted if I hadn't been yammering on about the game the whole way. It's only fair that I help out with the expenses."

The two friends stood by the side of the road for a good while, each stubborn in their stance and neither one willing to let the other shoulder the blame entirely. Their voices rose and fell, ricocheting between frustration and dogged determination, as their breaths formed misty clouds in the cold air around them.

Realizing that standing by their mangled vehicle wouldn't resolve the matter, Neil suggested they call a tow truck and head back to their shared apartment. But the conversation would continue intermittently for the next couple of days, each time the subject of the damaged car came up.

Determined to hold himself accountable, Neil took it upon himself to do the research, seeking out the best local workshop to have the car repaired, and spend time comparing quotes in order to settle on the most affordable and reputable option.

One evening later that week, Derrick approached Neil after dinner, seeming more solemn than usual. "Look, bud," he said softly, "I know you want to do right by me, but the car was ours to begin with. We're a team, Neil, and we share everything â€“ good and bad. So, why don't we just flip a coin and let fate decide who pays for it? That way, it's out of our hands."

Neil looked at his friend, contemplating his words, then finally conceded with a nod. "Alright, Derrick. Let's do it your way. Heads, I pay; tails, you pay," he said, drawing a deep breath.

Derrick produced a worn, silver coin from his pocket and flipped it. As it spun through the air, Neil knew that whatever the result, their friendship would remain strong; after all, they were a team, and that meant sticking together through triumph and adversity alike.
