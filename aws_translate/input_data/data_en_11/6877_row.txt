Question: A plant supplier was able to sell 20 pieces of orchids for $50 each and 15 pieces potted Chinese money plant for $25. The money he earned was then used to pay his two workers $40 each and to buy new pots worth $150. How much money was left from the plant supplier's earnings?
Answer: The plant supplier earned $50 x 20 = $1000 for the orchids. He earned $25 x 15 = $375 for the potted Chinese money plants. So, his total earnings was $1000 + $375 = $1375. Then he paid $40 x 2 = $80 to his workers. He used a total of $80 + $150 = $230 for the worker's pay and new pots. Hence, he was left with $1375 - $230 = $1145 from his earnings. The answer is 1145.
[Question]Sam works at the Widget Factory, assembling Widgets. He can assemble 1 widget every 10 minutes. Jack from the loading dock can help assemble widgets when he doesn't have anything else to do. When he helps, they put together 2 complete widgets every 15 minutes. Recently the factory hired Tony to help assemble widgets. Being new to the job, he doesn't work as fast as Sam or Jack. Yesterday Sam worked for 6 hours before he had to leave work early for a dentist appointment. Jack was able to help out for 4 hours before he had to go back to the loading dock to unload a new shipment of widget materials. Tony worked the entire 8-hour shift. At the end of the day, they had completed 68 widgets. How long does it take Tony to assemble a Widget, in minutes?
[Answer]Sam completes a widget every 10 minutes. When Jack helps they finish 2 in 15 minutes. Sam has finished 1 widget and has begun working on another one, and Jack finishes the second one at 15 minutes. So it takes Jack 15 minutes to complete a widget. Sam worked for 6 hours yesterday, so he was able to complete 6 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 10 minutes per widget = 36 widgets. Jack worked for 4 hours, so he was able to complete 4 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 15 minutes per widget = 16 widgets. Sam, Jack, and Tony were able to complete 68 widgets together. So of those, Tony personally completed 68 widgets - 36 widgets - 16 widgets = 16 widgets. It took Tony 8 hours to complete those 16 widgets, so he takes 8 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 16 widgets = 30 minutes per widget. The answer is 30.
Q: Max has 8 children and each of his children has the same number of children as he does except for 2 who have 5 children each. How many grandchildren does he have?
A: Out of his 8 children, 2 have only 5 children so the rest who have 8 ( the same number as him) are 8 - 2 = 6. 6 of Max's children have 8 children each for a total of 6 * 8 = 48 grandchildren. 2 of Max's children have 5 children each for a total of 5 * 2 = 10 grandchildren. In total he has 48 + 10 = 58 grandchildren. The answer is 58.
Question: Bart buys $10 of notepads for $1.25 each. They have 60 pages each. How many pages did he buy?

[Question]In a big box, there are marbles in 4 colors. Inside, there are 20 red marbles. There are three times more green marbles than red. Yellow marbles make up 20% of the green marbles. How many marbles are of a different color if the total of all marbles in the box is three times more than the number of green marbles?
[Answer]There are 3 * 20 = 60 green marbles. There are 60 * 20 / 100 = 12 yellow marbles. In total there are 3 * 60 = 180 marbles. That leaves 180 - 20 - 60 - 12 = 88 marbles of another color in the box. The answer is 88.
