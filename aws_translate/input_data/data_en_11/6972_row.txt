The sentence you provided states, "This model has been refined since the discovery of genes that can encode multiple proteins by alternative splicing and coding sequences split in short sections across the genome whose mRNAs are concatenated by trans-splicing." This sentence provides information related to the concepts of alternative splicing, coding sequences, and trans-splicing, but does not offer a clear or comprehensive answer to the question "How are alternative splicing and coding sequences distributed?" 

To address the question, let's first explain alternative splicing and coding sequences.

Alternative splicing is a process by which a single gene can produce multiple protein isoforms through the selective inclusion or exclusion of exons in the mRNA transcript. Exons are the coding regions of a gene that contain the information for protein synthesis. During mRNA maturation, introns (non-coding regions) are removed, and exons are assembled in various combinations to create different mature mRNA transcripts. The alternative splicing process allows a single gene to generate diverse proteins, which adds complexity to the proteome without requiring an increase in the number of genes.

Coding sequences, on the other hand, pertain to the sections of a gene that directly encode the information required to synthesize proteins. These sequences contain the triplet codon patterns that specify the amino acids needed to construct a protein. They are integral parts of the gene structure and play a crucial role in translating the genetic information into functional proteins.

Now, to answer the question of how alternative splicing and coding sequences are distributed, we must consider the arrangement of coding sequences within the genome and how this influences the potential for alternative splicing. Coding sequences are typically located within exons, and the positioning of exons--particularly their relative distances and the presence of regulatory elements that control the splicing process--are essential factors in determining the potential for alternative splicing.

In many cases, exons can be distributed throughout a gene, interspersed with introns. In some instances, exons can be quite small, and their distribution can impact the variety and regulation of alternative splicing events. The process of alternative splicing is influenced by cis-regulatory elements present within the exons and introns as well. These regulatory elements interact with trans-acting proteins, such as splicing factors, which collectively determine the outcome of alternative splicing events.

Apart from alternative splicing, the aforementioned sentence also touches on trans-splicing, a less common form of RNA processing. Trans-splicing involves the joining of exons from two different primary RNA transcripts, generating a mature mRNA molecule. This process alters the distribution of coding sequences by physically linking exons from distinct transcripts together. Though this phenomenon has been observed in various organisms, it is less prevalent and less well understood as compared to alternative splicing.

In summary, alternative splicing and coding sequences are distributed throughout the genome in a complex interplay between the arrangement of exons, introns, and regulatory elements. This distribution influences the potential for alternative splicing events to occur, ultimately impacting the diversity and complexity of the proteome. The provided sentence does touch upon some aspects of alternative splicing and coding sequences; however, it does not provide sufficient detail or clarity to completely answer the question at hand.
