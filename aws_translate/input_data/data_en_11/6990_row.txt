In a move that aligns with recent events that sparked debate and controversy, President Donald Trump announced via a tweet on Wednesday that he would disband his Manufacturing Council and Strategic and Policy Forum. The conventional reasoning he provided suggested that he preferred not to put pressure on the businesspeople involved. However, the Business Media outlet Bloomberg situates the disbanding differently, as it reveals that the Strategic and Policy Forum had made the choice to disband earlier on the same day. This decision came in the aftermath of public controversy surrounding comments President Trump made on Charlottesville, neo-Nazis, and white supremacists.

The Strategic and Policy Forum was a business advisory council that included influential figures such as the heads of prominent corporations like JPMorgan Chase, Blackstone, Walmart, BlackRock, and IBM. This brain trust of some of the world's leading businesses was intended to advise the president on strategic and policy matters, given their significant expertise and experience.

Concurrently, President Trump's Manufacturing Council has seen several of its members withdraw since the beginning of the week prior to the dissolution. Adding to the list of departing members, the CEO of Campbell's Soup, Denise Morrison, left the council on Wednesday. This comes as a significant development considering Morrison's standing as the last person to resign from the Manufacturing Council before President Trump disbanded the group.

As reported by NBC Philadelphia, Morrison's exit was marked by a strong statement indicating her dissatisfaction with President's Trump's response to the Charlottesville incident. "Racism and murder are unequivocally reprehensible and are not morally equivalent to anything else that happened in Charlottesville. I believe the President should have been—and still needs to be—unambiguous on that point," Morrison was quoted as saying. 

It was also mentioned by New York Times journalist, Landon Thomas Jr., that the majority of CEOs on the Strategic and Policy Forum were prepared to resign if the forum wasn't broken up, with nine of the twelve CEOs in agreement during a conference call prior to Trump's tweeted announcement. CNN reports that advocacy groups, sensing the tension, had already delivered a staggering 400,000 signatures to the CEOs of Blackstone and JPMorgan Chase, imploring them to leave the Strategic and Policy Forum.

Once President Trump officially disbanded the forum, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan, circulated a memo amongst his employees in which he categorically disagreed with President Trump's stance on the Charlottesville incident, a stance that many have found disturbingly ambivalent. To quote from Dimon's memo, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, “Racism, intolerance, and violence are always wrong,” there is “no room for equivocation here.”

The Daily Beast interprets the disbanding of these councils as considerably damaging for President Trump's image, given his previous claims of being a friend and champion of business. The article suggests that the resultant fissure between the incumbent administration and the business world could potentially impact forthcoming tax reform efforts negatively. 

However, the disbanding of the councils seemed to have little to no adverse effect on the stock market. Barron's reported a gain of 30 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the midst of President Trump's announcement. This clearly indicates a degree of resilience within the market, at least in the short term, in the face of developments that could otherwise stir significant investor uncertainty.
