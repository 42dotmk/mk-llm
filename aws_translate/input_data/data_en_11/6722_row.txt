Set against the backdrop of a nation divided by the Civil War, the plot delves into the heart-wrenching personal and political challenges that this remarkable couple faced together, as they helped to shape the future of the United States.

Act 1:

The film opens in Chicago, Illinois, 1839. A young and ambitious lawyer, Abraham Lincoln, arrives at a lavish party hosted by the prestigious Edwards family. Here, he is introduced to their enchanting cousin, Mary Todd, a highly educated and outspoken young woman hailing from a well-to-do Kentucky family. As the night unfolds, Lincoln becomes increasingly enamored by Mary's wit, intelligence, and passion for politics, as they engage in spirited discussions about the future of the young nation.

Meanwhile, doubts and disapproval begin to arise from Mary's family, who see Lincoln as a tall and gangly figure from a humble background, lacking the finesse and wealth necessary for a suitable match. Despite these challenges, Lincoln and Mary's bond only grows stronger as their love blossoms amid secret rendezvous and stolen glances.

Act 2:

As their courtship continues, Lincoln and Mary face increasing opposition, both from her family and from society at large. Lincoln's political foes seek to exploit their relationship, painting him as a man ruled by the whims of his eccentric and headstrong "southern belle." However, their love survives these external pressures, and they ultimately marry in a modest, private ceremony in 1842.

Following Lincoln's ascent to the Illinois state legislature and later to the U.S. Congress, Mary moves to Washington D.C., where she navigates the cutthroat world of high society and politics, often offering valuable insights and guidance to her husband's political career. The couple faces numerous personal hardships, including the tragic loss of their children and Mary's struggles with mental illness. Despite these challenges, Lincoln remains a devoted and loving husband, supporting Mary through her darkest days.

Act 3:

Amid the build-up to the 1860 presidential election, Lincoln and Mary find themselves at the forefront of a nation on the brink of war. As Lincoln takes his place as the 16th President of the United States, Mary assumes her role as First Lady, using her political acumen and charming demeanor to bolster support for her husband's controversial positions on slavery and the preservation of the Union. 

As the Civil War rages on, the movie reaches its emotional climax. Mary, now hardened by her experiences and overwhelmed by the grave responsibilities of her position, watches as her husband navigates one of the most tumultuous periods in American history. In his fight for unity, the love between Lincoln and Mary remains a source of strength for the President and a beacon of hope for an entire nation.

In a heart-wrenching final scene, viewers bear witness to the fateful night of April 14, 1865, when Mary and Lincoln attend a performance at Ford's Theatre â€“ a night that would tragically end in the assassination of President Lincoln. As Mary grieves the loss of her beloved husband, the film concludes with a poignant montage of their lives together, reminding the audience that it was their love and resilience that bound them together, shaping the course of American history and paving the way for a more united nation.
