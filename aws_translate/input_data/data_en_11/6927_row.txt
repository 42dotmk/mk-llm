Introduction: 

In an exciting bit of news for football fans, League One side Peterborough United has announced the re-signing of forward Paul Taylor for the 2021-2022 season. The 33-year-old forward, who has been on a year-long hiatus from professional football, has signed a one-year contract that marks his return to the sport. Taylor is no stranger to The Posh, having previously played for the club from 2011 to 2012.

Background on Paul Taylor's Career:

Born on 4th November 1987 in Liverpool, Paul Taylor began his football career playing for Vauxhall Motors before being signed by Chester City in the summer of 2008. Despite facing some challenges initially, the young striker found his groove and displayed his potential as a forward. In August 2011, he signed with Peterborough United, where he scored 12 goals in 48 appearances. His stint at the club attracted the attention of Ipswich Town, who signed him on a permanent deal in August 2012.

Taylor struggled to find his footing with Ipswich Town, only managing 27 appearances and one goal during his two-year spell with the club. He also experienced loan spells at Rotherham United, Crawley Town, and Gillingham before moving on to play for clubs like Bradford City, Doncaster Rovers, and Tranmere Rovers.

During his initial time at Peterborough United, Taylor made a significant impact with his goal scoring capability and creativity up front. Unfortunately, inconsistencies and missed opportunities led to Taylor's career experiencing a slow decline over the years. In 2020, Taylor decided to take a break from professional football for personal reasons.

Regardless of these concerns, Peterborough United management is hopeful that Taylor's return will provide ample depth upfront to complement the likes of top goal-scorer Jonson Clarke-Harris. With an ambitious goal of securing promotion to the Championship, the club is determined to make the 2021-2022 League One season one to remember.
