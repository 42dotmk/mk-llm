Question: Johnny spent 3 hours working on a job that paid $7 per hour, 2 hours working on a job that paid $10 an hour, and 4 hours working on a job that paid $12 an hour. Assuming he repeats this process 5 days in a row, how much does Johnny make?
Answer: First, we need to determine how much Johnny makes in one day. To start, we perform 3 * 7 = 21 dollars for the first job. Second, we perform 2 * 10 = 20 dollars for the second job. Third, we perform 4 * 12 = 48 dollars for the third job. Altogether, Johnny makes 21 + 20 + 48 = 89 dollars in a day. We multiply this amount by the 5 days, performing 5 * 89 = 445 dollars over 5 days. The answer is 445.
[Question]Jesse is desperately trying to finish a book for a school book report due on Monday so he can play this weekend. Friday afternoon, he read the first 5 chapters, which were 10, 15, 27, 12, and 19 pages, respectively, before taking a break. To his dismay, he found that he was only 1/3 of the way through the book. How many pages does he still have to read?
[Answer]So far, Jesse has read 10 + 15 + 27 + 12 + 19 = 83 pages. That's 1 / 3 of the book, so the remainder of the book is twice as many pages, or 2 * 83 = 166 pages. The answer is 166.
Q: For a class fundraiser, 30 students were asked to bring in 12 brownies each. 20 students were asked to bring in 24 cookies each and 15 students were asked to bring in 12 donuts each. If they sell everything for $2.00 each, how much money will they raise?
A: 30 students were asked to bring in 12 brownies so they will bring in 30 * 12 = 360 brownies. 20 students were asked to bring in 24 cookies each so that’s 20 * 24 = 480 cookies. 15 students were asked to bring in 12 donuts each so that’s 15 * 12 = 180 donuts. Together, they have 360 + 480 + 180 = 1,020 treats. If they sell all the treats for $2.00 each then they will make 1020 * 2 = $2,040.00. The answer is 2040.
Question: A professional company is hiring for a new position. They have two qualified applicants. The first applicant will accept a salary of $42000 and make the company $93000 in the first year, but needs 3 months of additional training that costs $1200 a month. The second applicant does not need training and will make the company $92000 in the first year, but is requesting a salary of $45000 and a hiring bonus of 1% of his salary. Less the amount it will cost to pay for each candidate, how many more dollars will one candidate make the company than the other in the first year?
Answer: The first candidate’s training will cost 1200 * 3 = $3600. That candidate will make the company 93000 - 42000 - 3600 = $47400 in the first year. The second candidate’s bonus will cost 45000 * 1 / 100 = $450. That candidate will make the company 92000 - 45000 - 450 = $46550 in the first year. Thus, the first candidate will make the company 47400 - 46550 = $850 more in the first year. The answer is 850.
