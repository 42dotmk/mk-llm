[Question]If Lyn donates $240 to a private organization each year where 1/3 of it goes to the community pantry project, 1/2 goes to the local crisis fund, 1/4 of the remaining goes to livelihood project funds, and the rest is for contingency funds. How much goes to contingency fund?
[Answer]The community pantry project gets 240 x 1 / 3 = $80. The local crisis fund has 240 x 1 / 2 = $120. The total funds allocated for the two funds is $80 + $120 = $200. So, $240 - $200 = $40 are left for the other 2 funds. The livelihood project gets $40 x 1 / 4 = $10. This means that the contingency fund is $40 - $10 = $30. The answer is 30.
Q: Jefferson has 56 bananas, while Walter, his friend, has 1/4 times fewer bananas. If they decide to combine their bananas and share them equally between themselves, how many bananas does Walter get?
A: Walter has 1 / 4 * 56 bananas = 14 fewer bananas. If Jefferson has 56 bananas, then Walter has 56 bananas - 14 bananas = 42 bananas. When they combine their bananas, they have a total of 42 bananas + 56 bananas = 98 bananas. After dividing the bananas equally, Walter gets 98 bananas / 2 = 49 bananas. The answer is 49.
Question: The card shop has two boxes of cards. The first box contains cards that cost $1.25 each. The second box contains cards that cost $1.75 each. A boy then comes in and buys 6 cards from each box. What was the total cost, in dollars, of the cards he bought?
Answer: The cost of one card from each box in total is 1.25 + 1.75 = 3 dollars. The total cost of cards the boy bought is 3 * 6 = 18 dollars. The answer is 18.
[Question]Jackson is buying school supplies for his third grade class, which has 30 students. Each student needs 5 pens, 3 notebooks, 1 binder and 2 highlighters. Pens cost $0.50, notebooks cost $1.25, binders cost $4.25, and highlighters cost $0.75. If Jackson gets a $100 teacher discount, how much does he spend on school supplies?
[Answer]First calculate the cost of the pens for one student by multiplying the number of pens by the cost per pen: 5 pens * $0.50 / pen = $2.50. Then calculate the cost of the notebooks for one student by multiplying the number of notebooks by the cost per notebook: 3 notebooks * $1.25 / notebook = $3.75. Then calculate the cost of the highlighters for one student by multiplying the number of highlighters by the cost per highlighters: 2 highlighters * $0.75 / highlighter = $1.50. Now add the cost of all the different supplies to find the total cost for one student: $2.50 + $3.75 + $1.50 + $4.25 = $12.00. Now multiply the cost per student by the number of students to find the total cost before the discount: 30 students * $12.00 / student = $360.00. Now subtract the teacher discount to find the final cost: $360.00 - $100.00 = $260.00. The answer is 260.
Q: Zilla spent 7% of her monthly earnings on rent, half of it on her other monthly expenses, and put the rest in her savings. If she spent $133 on her rent, how much does she deposit into her savings account in a month?
A: Since $133 is equal to 7% of her earnings, then 1% is equal to $133 / 7 = $19. The total monthly earning of Zilla is represented by 100%, so $19 x 100 = $1900 is her monthly earnings. So, $1900 / 2 = $950 is spent on her other monthly expenses. The total amount spent on the rent and other monthly expenses is $133 + $950 = $1083. Hence, she saves $1900 - $1083 = $817 per month. The answer is 817.
