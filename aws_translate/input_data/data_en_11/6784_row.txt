 Blackpool Police tweeted: "Could we BE any more overwhelmed with the response to our CCTV appeal after a theft at a restaurant in Blackpool? 
  
 "Most importantly, we're now satisfied we've identified the man in the still & our enquiries are very much continuing."

 Referring to the suspected thief's likeness to Schwimmer, the post ended: "Huge thanks for sharing it with your Friends." 
  
 On Wednesday, the Friends actor posted a video "proving" he was not behind the alleged theft by filming a hilarious spoof video of himself leaving a New York shop carrying a crate of cans, mimicking the suspected Blackpool thief. 
  
 Officers, I swear it wasn't me. 
  
 As you can see, I was in New York. 
  
 To the hardworking Blackpool Police, good luck with the investigation.#itwasntme pic.twitter.com/EDFF9dZoYR ‚Äî schwim (@DavidSchwimmer) October 24, 2018 
  
 He wrote on Twitter: "Officers, I swear it wasn't me. As you can see, I was in New York. To the hardworking Blackpool Police, good luck with the investigation." 
  
 The gif has been viewed at least six and a half million times, while the post has been retweeted more than 160,000 times and liked more than 536,000 times. 
  
 Lancashire Constabulary posted their original appeal for help identifying the suspect earlier this week, alongside a CCTV image of a man leaving a Blackpool eatery carrying what appeared to be a crate of cans on 20 September. 
  
 The force was subsequently inundated with replies from people saying he looked like Ross Geller, the character Schwimmer played in Friends. 
  
 The since-deleted post was shared more than 40,000 times - and attracted tens of thousands of likes from fans of the long-running US sitcom and setting in motion a week of Friendly social media banter.
