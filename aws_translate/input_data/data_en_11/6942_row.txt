Title: A Race Against Time

Plot Summary:
When estranged family, Michael, Tina, Jamie, and Billy suddenly receive news of a multi-million dollar inheritance, they are thrown together in a high-stakes cross-country car race to claim their fortune. As they are pursued by a dangerous crime lord who has his eyes set on the same inheritance, the estranged siblings are forced to put their differences aside, building a connection beyond wealth and power while overcoming their own personal demons.

Act 1:
Michael, a former car racer, leads an unfulfilling life as a car mechanic in a small desert town. He's estranged from his siblings, Tina - a successful businesswoman, Billy - a grad school dropout now working as a bartender, and Jamie - a passionate environmental activist, due to a family feud and toxic family history.

One day, they receive a mysterious letter from their long-lost grandfather, a wealthy businessman who'd been assumed dead for years. He bequeaths them with his multi-million dollar fortune but the twist is that they must participate in a cross-country car race to claim it. The rules state that they must embark on the journey together within 24 hours of receiving the letter and face multiple challenges and checkpoints along the way.

Act 2:
Michael, Tina, Jamie, and Billy begrudgingly agree to participate in the race, united by their desire for wealth and new beginnings. They gather at their childhood home, where they find their weapon for the journey, a beautifully restored classic car in the garage.

As they set out on their journey, they realize they're not the only ones interested in the inheritance. A dangerous crime lord, Victor Marcone, aware of their mission, wants the fortune for himself and sends his henchmen to intercept the siblings and claim the money. The henchmen chase the siblings in high-speed car battles, and the siblings must use their combined skills to stay ahead of the game.

Along the way, Michael, Tina, Jamie, and Billy find themselves in various towns, where they confront memories of their childhood and the reasons behind their estrangement. Overcoming their differences, the siblings grow closer together, working as a team to tackle and overcome the challenges laid out by their grandfather.

Act 3:
As the siblings reach their final checkpoint, they learn that Marcone has kidnapped their mother and held her captive to ensure the siblings hand over the inheritance. Michael, with his racing skills, decides to put everything on the line in a final car chase against Marcone.

The siblings band together, devising a plan to save their mother and claim the inheritance. Using their grandfather's challenges as a blueprint for their strategy, they manage to outsmart Marcone and his henchmen.

In the final showdown against Marcone, Michael outmaneuvers him in a high-intensity car race, sending the crime lord spiraling over a cliff, marking his defeat.

Conclusion:
Having successfully claimed the inheritance and saved their mother, the siblings recognize that they've gained something even more valuable than the fortune - the rediscovery of family and unity. They realize that the race was their grandfather's way of bringing them back together.

Michael decides to use his share of the inheritance to start a racing school for underprivileged kids, giving back to the community that built him. Tina, Jamie, and Billy also use their fortunes for good, fulfilling their lifelong dreams and making the world a better place.

The film ends with the siblings embarking on a leisurely road trip together, finally reunited and unburdened by their past as they cherish their bond as a family.
