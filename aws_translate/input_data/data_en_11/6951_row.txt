Q: Jonas is a book collector. He has so many books he is converting his third bedroom into a library. This room has 400 square feet of space. He plans to put several bookshelves in the room and each bookshelf takes up 80 square feet of space. If he reserves 160 square feet of space to use for a desk and some walking space, how many shelves can he put in the room?
A: If he reserves 160 sq. ft. of space for a desk and some walking space, then he will have 400 - 160 = 240 sq. ft. of space remaining. If each bookshelf takes up 80 sq. ft. of space, then 240 sq ft can contain 240 / 80 = 3 bookshelves. The answer is 3.
Question: On a 16 GB (gigabyte) capacity USB drive, 50% is already busy. Calculate the number of gigabytes still available.
Answer: We calculate 50% of 16 GB:. 50 / 100 * 16 GB = 0.5 * 16 GB = 8 GB. That leaves 16 GB - 8 GB = 8 GB available on this key. The answer is 8.
[Question]As a freelancer, Baylor is paid for every finished work of a client he does on a freelance marketplace. Currently, he has $4000 on his dashboard from previous work done. He is currently working for three clients, with the first client paying him half the amount of money he currently has on his dashboard once the job is done. The second client will pay him 2/5 times more money than the first client once Baylor finishes his work. The third client will pay him twice the amount of money the first and second clients pay him together once he finishes the job. How much money will Baylor have in his dashboard after all the clients pay him for his work?
[Answer]The first client will pay Baylor 1 / 2 * $4000 = $2000. The second client will pay Baylor 2 / 5 times more money than the first client, a total of 2 / 5 * $2000 = $800. The total amount of money the second client will pay Baylor once the job is done is $2000 + $800 = $2800. The total amount of money the first and the second client will pay Baylor after their work is finished is $2800 + $2000 = $4800. The third client will pay him twice the amount of money the first and second clients pay him together, a total of 2 * $4800 = $9600. Together, the three clients will pay Baylor $9600 + $4800 = $14400 once he finishes their jobs. In his dashboard, Baylor will have $14400 + $4000 = $18400. The answer is 18400.
Q: At football tryouts, the coach wanted to see who could throw the ball the farthest. Parker threw the ball 16 yards. Grant threw the ball 25 percent farther than Parker and Kyle threw the ball 2 times farther than Grant. Compared to Parker, how much farther did Kyle throw the ball?
A: Grant threw the ball 25% farther than Parker. If Parker threw the ball 16 yards, then Grant threw it 16 * .25 = 4 farther. In total, Grant threw the ball 16 + 4 = 20 yards. Kyle threw 2 times farther than Grant so Kyle threw the ball 2 * 20 = 40 yards. If Kyle threw the ball for 40 yards and Parker threw for 16 then Kyle threw the ball 40 - 16 = 24 yards farther. The answer is 24.
Question: There were 18 students assigned in a minibus for a field trip. Eight of these students were boys. On the day of the field trip, the number of girls and boys was the same since some of the girls were not able to join the trip. How many girls were not able to join the field trip?
Answer: 8 boys + 8 girls = 16 students joined the field trip. Thus, 18 - 16 = 2 girls were not able to join the field trip. The answer is 2.
