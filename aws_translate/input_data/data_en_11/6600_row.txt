We are introduced to Lou's older step-brother, Mike, who had parted ways with the family many years ago. Mike is now successfully running an art gallery in a different city. Lou receives news about Mike's return to the city for a special art exhibition, and he is eager to reconnect with his estranged step-brother.

Meanwhile, the city's most dangerous crime boss, Vincent, has been keeping a close eye on Lou following his attempts to dismember his empire. To keep Lou in check, Vincent decides to infiltrate the art exhibition, posing as a legitimate businessman and philanthropist looking to contribute to the local art scene.

They discuss their past and the different paths they've taken, with Mike expressing his wish to one day leave the art world and focus on something meaningful. However, as they reconnect, Vincent starts to take an interest in Mike's art gallery. Mike unknowingly accepts Vincent's business proposal, unaware of his true criminal identity.

Unbeknownst to Lou and Mike, Vincent plans to use the art gallery as a front for money laundering and other illegal activities. Lou, however, begins to grow suspicious as he sees Vincent's influence taking shape in the gallery.

Vincent soon discovers that Mike and Lou are step-brothers and decides to blackmail Mike into helping him destroy Lou's reputation. He threatens to reveal Mike's darkest secret, one that could ruin his life.

In a desperate attempt to save both his step-brother and his own career, Lou devises a risky plan to bring down Vincent. Mike ultimately decides to stand with Lou and help him bring justice, even if it means putting their own lives at risk.

The climax of the movie unfolds in a dramatic and tense action sequence, where Lou and Mike, aided by their trusted allies in the police force, raid Vincent's criminal headquarters and expose his illegal operations.
