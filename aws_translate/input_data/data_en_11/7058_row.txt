A: Elsa spent 58 * 2 = 116. Elizabeth spent 116 * 4 = 464. Emma, Elsa, and Elizabeth spent 58 + 116 + 464 = 638 in total. The answer is 638.
Question: Anna is reading a 31-chapter textbook, but she skips all the chapters that are divisible by 3. If it takes her 20 minutes to read each chapter, how many hours does she spend reading total?
Answer: First divide 32 by 3, ignoring the remainder, to find how many chapters in the book are divisible by 3: 31 / 3 = 10.33..., which means 10 chapters are divisible by 3. Then subtract that number from the total number of chapters to find how many chapters she reads: 31 chapters - 10 chapters = 21 chapters. Then multiply the number chapters by the time to read each chapter to find the total time she spends reading: 21 chapters * 20 minutes / chapter = 420 minutes. Then divide that time by the number of minutes per movie to find the total time spent reading in hours: 420 minutes / 60 minutes / hour = 7 hours. The answer is 7.
[Question]Antoine owns a strawberry farm that supplies strawberries to his local bakeries. The first bakery needs 2 sacks, the second bakery needs 4 sacks, and the third bakery needs 12 sacks of strawberries per week. How many sacks of strawberries does he need to supply all the bakeries in 4 weeks?
[Answer]The first bakery needs 2 x 4 = 8 sacks of strawberries per month. The second bakery needs 4 x 4 = 16 sacks of strawberries per month. The third bakery needs 12 x 4 = 48 sacks of strawberries per month. Therefore, Antoine needs 48 + 16 + 8 = 72 sacks of strawberries to supply all the bakeries for a month. The answer is 72.
Q: Mary is going on a business trip. It takes 10 minutes for her Uber to get to her house and 5 times longer to get to the airport. It takes 15 minutes to check her bag and three times as long to get through security. Then she has to wait for 20 minutes for her flight to start boarding and twice as long before the plane is ready to take off. How many hours will this process take total?
A: First find the time to drive to the airport: 10 minutes * 5 = 50 minutes. Then find the time it takes to get through security: 15 minutes * 3 = 45 minutes. Then find the time Mary spends waiting for the plane to take off: 20 minutes * 2 = 40 minutes. Then add the time to each step to find the total time: 10 minutes + 50 minutes + 15 minutes + 45 minutes + 20 minutes + 40 minutes = 180 minutes. Then divide that amount by the number of minutes per hour to cover the total time to hours: 180 minutes / 60 minutes / hour = 3 hours. The answer is 3.
Question: In a factory, there are 300 employees. 200 of them earn $12 per hour. Of the rest, 40 of them earn $14 per hour. All others earn $17 per hour. What is the cost to employ all these people for one 8-hour long shift?
Answer: The cost of the 200 employees is 200 employees * $12 / employee / hour = $2400 per hour. The cost of the 40 employees is 40 employees * $14 / employee / hour = $560 per hour. The rest means 300 employees - 200 employees - 40 employees = 60 employees. These 60 employees' employment costs are at 60 employees * $17 / employee / hour = $1020 per hour. So in total all employees earn $2400 / hour + $560 / hour + $1020 / hour = $3980 / hour. During an 8 - hour shift, this cost would be at 8 hours * $3980 / hour = $31840. The answer is 31840.
