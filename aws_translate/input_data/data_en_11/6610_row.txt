How much more money did Ms. Elizabeth make from her investments than Mr. Banks?
[Answer]Since Mr. Banks had 8 investment streams and each brought in a revenue of $500, he earned 500 * 8 = $4000 from all of his investments. Ms Elizabeth also received $900 * 5 = $4500 in revenue from her 5 income streams,. The total amount of money that Ms. Elizabeth made more than Mr. Banks is $4500 - $4000 = $500. The answer is 500.
Q: After trick-or-treating, Brent dumped his candy on the table. He had received 5 Kit-Kat bars, three times that amount in Hershey kisses, 8 boxes of Nerds, and 11 lollipops. He also had 10 Baby Ruths and half that amount in Reese Peanut butter cups. After giving his little sister 5 lollipops, how many pieces of candy did Brent have left?
A: He had 5 Kit - Kats and had 3 times that amount in Kisses so he had 5 * 3 = 15 Hershey kisses. He had 10 Baby Ruths and half that amount in Reese Peanut butter cups so he had 10 / 2 = 5 Reese Peanut Butter cups. He had 11 lollipops and gave 5 to his sister so he now had 11 - 5 = 6 lollipops. When you add up all of the candy, he had 5 Kit - Kats, 15 Hershey kisses, 10 Baby Ruths, 5 Reese cups, 8 Nerds and 6 lollipops so 5 + 15 + 10 + 5 + 8 + 6 = 49 pieces of candy. The answer is 49.
Question: There are 2000 pinecones on the ground. 20% are eaten by reindeer. Twice as many are eaten by squirrels as reindeer. 25% of the remainder are collected to make fires. How many pinecones are left?
Answer: First find the number of pinecones eaten by reindeer: 20% * 2000 pinecones = 400 pine cones. Then find the total number of pinecones eaten by squirrels: 400 pine cones * 2 = 800 pine cones. Then subtract those two amounts to find the number of pinecones left: 2000 pinecones - 400 pine cones - 800 pine cones = 800 pinecones. Divide that number by 4 to find the number that are collected for fires: 800 pinecones / 4 = 200 pine cones. Then subtract that number from the 800 pinecones to find the total left on the ground: 800 pine cones - 200 pinecones = 600 pine cones. The answer is 600.
[Question]Jared wants to watch a series with four episodes. The first three episodes are 58 minutes, 62 minutes, and 65 minutes long respectively. If the four episodes last 4 hours, how long is the fourth episode?
[Answer]The first three episodes are 58 + 62 + 65 = 185 minutes long. In minutes, the four episodes last 4 x 60 = 240 minutes. Then, the fourth episode is 240 - 185 = 55 minutes long. The answer is 55.
Q: Alice was able to sell $2500 worth of gadgets. For this month, she expects to receive her monthly basic salary of $240 and a 2% commission from these sales. How much is she going to save this month if she usually saves 10% of her total earnings?
A: Alice will get $2500 x 2 / 100 = $50 from her commission. This month, she will receive a total of $240 + $50 = $290. Therefore, Alice will save $290 x 10 / 100 = $29 for this month. The answer is 29.
