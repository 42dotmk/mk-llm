scalpel provides better precision and control, minimizing tissue damage and ensuring a smoother healing process for the patient.

In surgical procedures, the choice of instruments is crucial to ensure the success of the intervention and reduce the risk of complications. Although razors might seem like a viable option, as they are often used in shaving or other cutting tasks, they lack the specific characteristics that make scalpels more suitable for surgical incisions.

Firstly, scalpels are designed with precision in mind. They are characterized by their sharp, thin, and pointed blades, specifically engineered to create clean and accurate cuts with minimal tissue damage. This sharpness allows surgeons to exert less force when cutting, reducing the risk of unwanted tissue damage. 

On the other hand, razors are typically broader, and while they are sharp, they are not as finely honed as scalpels. This lack of precision can result in unnecessary tissue trauma, which can lead to increased bleeding, inflammation, and slower healing times. Moreover, razors are more likely to pull on the tissue rather than slicing through it, which can be painful for the patient and may result in an uneven or jagged incision.

Secondly, the design of the scalpel handle allows for better control and maneuverability during surgery. Handles are typically metal or plastic and are shaped to comfortably fit in the hand of the surgeon. They're often ribbed or textured, which provides a secure grip, ensuring that the blade doesn't slip out of the surgeon's hand. This level of control is crucial during delicate procedures, where even the slightest error can lead to serious complications or unwanted side effects.

In contrast, razor handles are often designed for a completely different purpose - shaving. As such, they may not offer the same level of grip security and control required for surgical contexts. Furthermore, razors are generally designed for single-handed use, whereas many surgical procedures require the use of both hands on the instrument for increased precision and stability.

Another critical factor influencing the choice of scalpel over razor is sterility. In surgical environments, maintaining a sterile field is essential to prevent infection. Scalpels are specifically designed for use in these environments, with single-use, disposable blades that can be easily mounted onto reusable handles. The blades are typically packaged in a sterile manner, making them suitable for use in an operating room.

Razors, however, are not expressly designed for maintaining surgical sterility. While disposable razors could be theoretically used in a surgical setting, they're not packaged with the same level of sterility as scalpels. Furthermore, their construction may not allow them to be adequately cleaned and sterilized between procedures, posing a high risk of cross-contamination and infection.

Lastly, surgeons undergo extensive training to master the use of scalpels and other surgical tools. This expertise allows them to skillfully execute various techniques that ensure accurate, efficient, and safe incisions. Replacing a scalpel with a razor could compromise patient safety, as the surgeon may not be familiar with its performance and limitations.

In conclusion, the scalpel was used to cut the incision instead of the razor because of its superior precision, better control, sterile design, and compatibility with established surgical techniques. This choice ultimately supports the patient's well-being by minimizing tissue damage and ensuring a smoother, safer, and quicker healing process.
