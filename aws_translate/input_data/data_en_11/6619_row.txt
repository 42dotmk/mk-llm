The planned formulated by Raivis Zeltits, a Latvian historian and political activist, aimed to form a federation of Central and Eastern European countries after World War I. This initiative was called Intermarium, also known as Międzymorze, translating to "Between-Seas." The Intermarium concept was initially introduced by political and military leader Józef Piłsudski, the first Marshal of Poland, who sought to revive the old Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, create a buffer between the newly restored Poland, and reduce the influence of competing powers in the region — specifically Germany and the Soviet Union.

The Intermarium plan envisioned a geopolitical alliance consisting of several Central and Eastern European countries, including (but not limited to) Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Yugoslavia. This federation aimed to unite these nations under a single political, economic, and military alliance committed to each other's mutual defense and the maintenance of regional stability.

The primary goals of the Intermarium plan were:

1. Security: To ensure the protection and sovereignty of Central and Eastern European countries from potential aggression or influence from larger powers, particularly Germany and the Soviet Union.

2. Economic Cooperation: To promote economic collaboration among the member nations, allowing for the exchange of resources, technology, and expertise while supporting collective growth and development.

3. Cultural Exchange: To strengthen regional ties by fostering cultural and educational exchanges within the federation, encouraging a sense of shared identity and common heritage.

4. Democratic Governance: To facilitate the consolidation of democratic institutions and values across the Intermarium region, effectively ensuring that the member states could rely on a stable political landscape.

5. Geopolitical Balance: To maintain a balance of power in Europe as a whole and counter the expansionist ambitions of any aggressive or imperialist actors.

Despite the potential benefits of the Intermarium alliance, various challenges emerged that prevented its successful implementation. Some of these obstacles were:

1. Nationalism: Many countries in the region recently achieved independence after World War I, and their focus was primarily on establishing a national identity and sovereignty. The idea of combining into a larger federation was perceived by some as a threat to these nascent states' independence.

2. Territorial Disputes: Central and Eastern European countries held unresolved border disputes, which caused conflicts and mistrust among them, making it difficult for these nations to unite.

3. Political Rivalry: Piłsudski's death in 1935, and the subsequent shift in Poland’s political landscape, resulted in a weaker Polish state that was unable to lead the Intermarium initiative.

4. External Influence: Germany and the Soviet Union both saw the Intermarium plan as a potential threat to their influence and interests. As a result, they applied diplomatic pressure to discourage Central and Eastern European countries from joining the proposed federation.

Ultimately, the Intermarium plan was never realized due to these challenges. Nevertheless, the idea persisted throughout the 20th century and influenced later regional cooperation initiatives, such as the Visegrád Group and the European Union's Eastern Partnership. Today, the concept of Intermarium continues to be discussed and debated as a historical precedent for present-day regional cooperation in Central and Eastern Europe.
