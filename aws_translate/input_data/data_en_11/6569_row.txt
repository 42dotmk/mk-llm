everything good for Liverpool. Took his goal well but couldn't help prevent Chelsea's comebacks. Showed promise and potential. 7

Dejan Lovren: Returned to the lineup after being left out against Real Madrid, but his inconsistent form continued. Struggled to contain the likes of Diego Costa and was partly at fault for Chelsea's second goal. 5

Martin Skrtel: A mixed bag in defense, had some crucial tackles and clearances but failed to effectively handle Chelsea's attackers. Needs to improve communication with the defensive line. 6

Alberto Moreno: Showed great pace going forward and supported the Liverpool attack adequately, but his defensive work left a lot to be desired. Needs to find a balance between attack and defense. 6

Steven Gerrard: The captain tried his best to lead and inspire his team, but was outplayed by Chelsea's midfield. Created some chances, but his influence on the game was limited. Faded as the match went on. 6

Jordan Henderson: Worked tirelessly in midfield, winning balls and distributing well at times, but his final product was lacking in key situations. 6

Philippe Coutinho: Showed flashes of brilliance and creativity in attack but was unable to consistently break down Chelsea's defense. Frustrating night. 6

Raheem Sterling: A constant threat for Liverpool with his pace and dribbling, but his final decision-making in the final third was often poor. A learning experience. 7

Mario Balotelli: Started the match with energy and desire, but struggled to make a significant impact. Failed to test Thibaut Courtois and was taken off early in the second half. 5

Substitutes:
Rickie Lambert: Came on for Balotelli and tried to make an impact, but the game had already tilted in Chelsea's favor. 5

CHELSEA
Thibaut Courtois: Another solid performance from the Belgian goalkeeper, making crucial saves when needed. Commanded his area well. 7

Branislav Ivanovic: A typical Ivanovic performance â€“ strong both in defense and attack. Made vital blocks and showed a great understanding with Gary Cahill. 7

Gary Cahill: Scored a crucial equalizer and was a rock at the back. A key player for Chelsea in their title challenge. 8

John Terry: An experienced performance from the Chelsea captain, dealing with Liverpool's attacking threats well. Made important clearances and interceptions. 7

Cesar Azpilicueta: Solid defensively for the most part, keeping Liverpool's wingers at bay. Offered occasional support in attack. 6

Nemanja Matic: The pick of Chelsea's players. Dominated the midfield battle with his physical presence and intelligent play. A crucial cog in Mourinho's machine. 8

Cesc Fabregas: Continues to impress in Chelsea's midfield, linking well with the attackers. Played a part in both goals and controlled the tempo of the game. 8

Willian: Tireless work rate and contributed both in attack and defense. Kept Liverpool's midfield on their toes. 7

Oscar: A quiet game by his standards but still contributed to the team's performance. Substituted in the second half. 6

Eden Hazard: A constant menace for Liverpool with his dribbling and pace. Created chances, but was unlucky not to get on the scoresheet himself. 7

Diego Costa: Scored the winning goal, showcasing his predatory instincts. A constant threat to Liverpool's defense with his movement and physicality. 8

Substitutes:
Ramires: Came on for Oscar and added more steel to Chelsea's midfield. Helped close out the game. 6

Kurt Zouma: Late substitute, wasn't given much time to impact the match. N/A

Andre Schurrle: Came on late to help see out the game. Didn't have much of an impact at either end. N/A
