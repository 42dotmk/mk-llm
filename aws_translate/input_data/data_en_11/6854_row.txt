Q: Zion made a triangular-shaped house of cards with the base having a measurement of 40 centimeters and a height of 20 centimeters. If two of his friends also built similar shaped houses, what's the total area of the triangular houses that Zion and his friends made (the area of a triangle is 1/2 * width * height)?
A: Since the area of a triangle is given by 1 / 2 base * height, the area of the triangular - shaped house of cards that Zion made is 1 / 2 * 40 * 20 = 400 square centimeters. If two of his friend also built similar shaped houses, the total area of their triangular - shaped house of cards is 400 + 400 = 800 square centimeters. Together with Zion, they all built triangular - shaped houses of cards with a combined area of 800 + 400 = 1200 square centimeters. The answer is 1200.
Question: There are 12 crates that each contain 150 oranges. There are 16 boxes that each hold 30 nectarines. How many pieces of fruit are in the crates and the boxes in total?
Answer: Oranges = 12 * 150 = 1800. Nectarines = 16 * 30 = 480. 1800 + 480 = 2280. There are 2280 pieces of fruit in total. The answer is 2280.
[Question]Janice adds 2 tablespoons of koolaid power and 16 tablespoons of water to a jug. She leaves it out long enough for 4 tablespoons of water to evaporate. Then she quadruples the amount of water in the jug. What percentage of the liquid in the jug is koolaid powder?
[Answer]First find how many tablespoons of water are left after the evaporation: 16 tbs - 4 tbs = 12 tbs. Then multiply this number by 4 to find how much water is in the jug after Janice refills it: 12 tbs * 4 = 48 tbs. Now add the 2 tablespoons of koolaid powder to find the total volume of the liquid in the jug: 48 tbs + 2 tbs = 50 tbs. Now divide the volume of the koolaid powder by the total volume and multiply by 100% to find the percentage of the liquid that's koolaid: 2 tbs / 50 tbs * 100% = 4%. The answer is 4.
Q: Mason opens the hood of his car and discovers that squirrels have been using his engine compartment to store nuts. If 2 busy squirrels have been stockpiling 30 nuts/day and one sleepy squirrel has been stockpiling 20 nuts/day, all for 40 days, how many nuts are in Mason's car?
A: First find the number of nuts the two busy squirrels gather per day: 2 squirrels * 30 nuts / day / squirrel = 60 nuts / day. Then add the number the sleepy squirrel gathers each day: 60 nuts / day + 20 nuts / day = 80 nuts / day. Then multiply the number of nuts gathered daily by the number of days to find the total number of nuts gathered: 80 nuts / day * 40 days = 3200 nuts. The answer is 3200.
Question: Seth and his brother want to see their favorite band in concert. The tickets are $50.00 each. There is a 15% processing fee for the tickets. They are also charged $10.00 for parking and an additional $5.00 per person entrance fee. How much will it cost to go to the concert?
Answer: The tickets are $50.00 each and they need 2 tickets so that's 50 * 2 = $100.00. There is a 15% processing fee for the tickets so that's 100 * .15 = $15.00. The tickets are $100.00 and the processing fee is $15.00 for a total of 100 + 15 = $115.00. There is a $5.00 per person entrance fee and there are 2 people so that's 5 * 2 = $10.00. The tickets are $115.00, parking is $10.00 and the entrance fee is $10.0 for a total of 115 + 10 + 10 = $135.00. The answer is 135.
