Question: In a day, Sam hunts 6 animals. Rob hunts half as many animals as Sam. Mark hunts 1/3 of the total of what Rob and Sam hunt. If Peter hunts 3 times as many animals as Mark does, how many animals do they all hunt in a day?
Answer: Rob hunts 1 / 2 * 6 animals / day = 3 animals / day. Rob and Sam hunt 3 animals / day + 6 animals / day = 9 animals / day. Mark hunts 1 / 3 * 9 animals / day = 3 animals in a day. Peter hunts 3 * 3 animals / day = 9 animals in a day. The total they all hunt in a day is 6 animals / day + 3 animals / day + 3 animals / day + 9 animals / day = 21 animals. The answer is 21.
[Question]Kimberley, Ela, and Houston all are sent to collect firewood by their grammy. Kimberley collects ten pounds of firewood, and Houston collects 12 pounds of firewood. If the three of them managed to collect a total of 35 pounds of firewood, how many pounds were collected by Ela?
[Answer]Kimberley and Houston collected 10 + 12 = 22 pounds of firewood. You can find how much Ela collected by subtracting that amount from the total amount collected: 35 - 22 = 13 pounds. The answer is 13.
Q: Barney's grocery store sold out all of its items at the beginning of the pandemic, so they ordered extra items to restock the shelves. However, they ended up ordering far too much and have to keep the leftover items in the storeroom. If they ordered 4458 items, sold another 1561 items that day, and have 575 items in the storeroom, how many items do they have left in the whole store?
A: Barney's grocery store started with 0 items + 4458 they ordered = 4458 items total. That day they sold 1561 items, so 4458 total - 1561 sold = 2897 items. If there are 575 items in the storeroom, then there are 575 + 2897 = 3472 items in the whole store. The answer is 3472.
Question: An archaeologist discovered three dig sites from different periods in one area. The archaeologist dated the first dig site as 352 years more recent than the second dig site. The third dig site was dated 3700 years older than the first dig site. The fourth dig site was twice as old as the third dig site. The archaeologist studied the fourth dig siteâ€™s relics and gave the site a date of 8400 BC. What year did the archaeologist date the second dig site?
Answer: The third dig site was dated from the year 8400 / 2 = 4200 BC. Thus, the first dig site was dated from the year 4200 - 3700 = 500 BC. The second dig site was 352 years older, so it was dated from the year 500 + 352 = 852 BC. The answer is 852.
[Question]Pulsar, the shuffle-dancing bear, Polly, the pink prancing poodle, and Petra, the proud portly pachyderm, are entertainers at the Big Top Circus. In one show, Pulsar stands on his two back legs for a total of 10 minutes. Then, Polly stands on her back legs for three times as long as Pulsar. And then, finally, Petra stands of his back legs for one-sixth as long as Polly. What is the combined length of time, in minutes, that the three entertainers stand on their back legs?
[Answer]Polly stands on her back legs for 3 * 10 = 30 minutes. Petra stands on his back legs for 30 / 6 = 5 minutes. In total, the three entertainers stand on their back legs for 10 + 30 + 5 = 45 minutes'. The answer is 45.
