Terri Fletcher was a teenager who had an innate passion for singing. At every opportunity, she would let her voice soar and dance along with the ambient sounds of her world. She dreamt of one day becoming a professional singer, standing on the stage as the audience listened to every note she sang and every lyric she penned. However, life as a teenager often proved chaotic, and Terri found her rock in the close relationship she shared with her elder brother Paul.

Paul, despite being older, understood Terri's passion and encouraged her every step of the way. Together, they would practice and rehearse for hours, getting lost in the melodies they created. Paul knew his sister had a talent that needed to be appreciated and Terri was grateful for having such a supportive brother.

One day, Paul's friend, Simon, invited them to his graduation-day barbecue. Friends and family gathered at the venue to celebrate Simon's accomplishment and the air was filled with laughter and the aroma of sizzling barbecue. Terri tagged along with her brother, as she relished the opportunity to spend more time with him. However, amidst the good vibes, a storm was brewing.

Paul did not get along well with Simon's acquaintance, Robin Childers. They had had a falling out over Robin's previous relationship with Jay the previous summer. Robin's reputation as a troublemaker was widespread and Paul did not want Robin's drama-filled life to seep into his or Terri's. He was afraid that Robin could jeopardize Terri's dream.

As the evening wore on, tensions escalated between Paul and Robin. Eventually, it culminated into a nasty altercation that caused the celebratory vibe to sour. Concerned for her brother's well-being and her own safety, Terri quietly slipped away from the festivities and retreated to her safe space -her home studio. It was just the two of them in their small abode, their parents away for the weekend, so Terri felt a strange, unnameable sense of unease creeping up on her as she sang alone in the room.

Soon, Paul managed to compose himself after the fight and return home. Upon noticing Terri's withdrawal from the event and the somber mood that weighed over her, Paul knew he had to do something drastic to ensure his sister's safety and mental well-being. He placed a call to Simon, asking for help in sensitive yet unresolved situation.

And so, Simon decided to fly to Los Angeles with Terri, hoping to take her away from the negative environment and provide her with an opportunity to focus on her dreams. He had connections in the music industry and remembered fondly how Terri had sung at the party earlier, realizing the potential in her voice. Simon believed that by pulling Terri away from the drama and into a city full of dream-chasers, she would have the chance to turn her dreams into reality, surrounded by a supportive network that extended beyond her brother.

Paul, understanding that sometimes one has to let go of those closest to them for their growth, grudgingly agreed to let Terri leave with Simon. He trusted Simon to take care of her and swore to visit her in Los Angeles as often as he could.

When Terri arrived in Los Angeles, she was immediately overtaken by the swirl of energy that the city carried. She felt the magnetic pull of her dreams and her heart filled with hope. In this city of angels and dreamers, she could feel the love of her brother from miles away, believing in her and supporting her dreams, as she let her voice rise and pierce through the noise. And though they were far apart, they would continue to share a bond that would only grow stronger as Terri pursued her dreams in the city that never slept.
