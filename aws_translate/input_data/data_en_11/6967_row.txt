Question: Seymour runs a plant shop. He has 4 flats of petunias with 8 petunias per flat, 3 flats of roses with 6 roses per flat, and two Venus flytraps. Each petunia needs 8 ounces of fertilizer, each rose needs 3 ounces of fertilizer, and each Venus flytrap needs 2 ounces of fertilizer. How many ounces of fertilizer does Seymour need in total?
Answer: First find the total number of petunias: 4 flats * 8 petunias / flat = 32 petunias. Then find the total number of roses: 3 flats * 6 roses / flat = 18 roses. Now find how much fertilizer Seymour needs for the petunias: 32 petunias * 8 oz / petunia = 256 oz. Now find how much fertilizer Seymour needs for the roses: 18 roses * 3 oz / rose = 54 oz. Now find how much fertilizer Seymour needs for the Venus flytraps: 2 Venus flytraps * 2 oz / Venus flytrap = 4 oz. Now add up the fertilizer for all three plants: 256 oz + 54 oz + 4 oz = 314 oz. The answer is 314.
[Question]Valerie’s cookie recipe makes 16 dozen cookies and calls for 4 pounds of butter. She only wants to make 4 dozen cookies for the weekend. How many pounds of butter will she need?
[Answer]Her original recipe makes 16 dozen and she only needs 4 dozen so she needs to reduce the recipe by 16 / 4 = 4. For 4 dozen cookies, she needs to reduce her recipe by 4 and the original called for 4 pounds of butter so she now needs 4 / 4 = 1 pound of butter. The answer is 1.

Question: Next year, there will be twice as many people going to the fair as are going this year, and the number of people who went to the fair last year was 200 less than those going next year. If the number of people going to the fair this year is 600, calculate the number of people at the fair in the three years.
Answer: If there are 600 people at the fair this year, the number going to the fair next year is 2 * 600 = 1200. The number of people at the fair this year and the ones going next year totals 1200 + 600 = 1800. The number of people who went to that fair last year was 200 less than those going next year, meaning there were 1200 - 200 = 1000 people at the fair last year. In the three years, the number of people at the fair will be 1800 of this and next year + 1000 of last year = 2800. The answer is 2800.
[Question]Sam went for a run in the morning. In the afternoon, he went grocery shopping and walked twice the distance through the store as he had run that morning. That evening, he went on a bike ride with his family and biked for 12 miles. In all, he went 18 miles that day. How many miles was Sam’s morning run?
[Answer]Let X be the distance Sam ran. His walk through the store was twice the distance of his run, so his walk was 2X. He biked for 12 miles and went 18 miles in all, so he walked and ran 18 - 12 = 6 miles. Thus, his walk and run together were X + 2X = 3X = 6 miles. Thus, he ran X = 6 / 3 = 2 miles. The answer is 2.
