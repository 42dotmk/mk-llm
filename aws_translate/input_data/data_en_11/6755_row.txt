Q: Patrick buys a season pass for each of his sons to visit the local amusement park as often as they want. The passes were $100.00 each. The oldest son went to the park 35 times over the summer and the youngest went 15 times. What was the cost per trip to the park?
A: Patrick bought 2 tickets at $100.00 each for a total of 2 * 100 = $200.00. The oldest son went 35 times and the youngest went 15 times for a total of 35 + 15 = 50 trips. The tickets cost $200.00 and together, the boys went to the park 50 times so each trip cost 200 / 50 = $4.00. The answer is 4.
Question: Melony makes $21 of profit every time she sells 3 shirts and four times as much profit when she sells two pairs of sandals. How much profit will she make if she sells 7 shirts and 3 pairs of sandals?
Answer: Melony makes $21 * 4 = $84 of profit for two pairs of sandals. Melony makes $84 / 2 pairs = $42 of profit per pair of shoes. Melony makes $21 / 3 shirts = $7 of profit per shirt. For seven shirts, Melony will make 7 shirts * $7 = $49 of profit. For three pairs of sandals, Melony will make 3 pairs * $42 / pair = $126 of profit. Melony will make a total of $49 + $126 = $175 of profit. The answer is 175.
[Question]Ray buys a pack of hamburger meat for $5.00, a box of crackers for $3.50, 4 bags of frozen vegetables at $2.00 per bag and a pack of cheese for $3.50 at the grocery store. Because he is a store rewards member, he gets 10% off of his purchase. What does his total grocery bill come to?
[Answer]He buys 4 bags of frozen vegetables for $2.00 a bag so that’s 4 * 2 = $8.00. The meat is $5.00, the crackers are $3.50, the vegetables are $8.00 and the cheese is $3.50 for a total of 5 + 3.50 + 8 + 3.50 = $20.00. He gets 10% discount on his $20.00 purchase so that’s .10 * 20 = $2.00 off. His final grocery bill will be 20 - 2 = $18.00. The answer is 18.
Q: Three friends Wolfgang, Ludo, and Michael, went to Walmart and bought marbles. Wolfgang bought 16 marbles, Ludo bought 1/4 times more marbles than Wolfgang, and Michael bought 2/3 times as many marbles as the number of marbles both Wolfgang and Ludo bought. If they combined their marbles and decided to share them equally, how many marbles did each get?
A: Ludo bought 1 / 4 more marbles than Wolfgang, which is 1 / 4 * 16 marbles = 4 marbles. The total number of marbles that Ludo bought is 16 marbles + 4 marbles = 20 marbles. Wolfgang and Ludo purchased a total of 20 marbles + 16 marbles = 36 marbles. If Michael bought 2 / 3 times the total number of marbles bought by Wolfgang and Ludo, he bought 2 / 3 * 36 marbles = 24 marbles. The three friends purchased a total of 24 marbles + 36 marbles = 60 marbles. When they shared the marbles equally, each got 60 marbles / 3 people = 20 marbles / person. The answer is 20.
Question: A pipe is clogged so that only 2 ounces of cleaner can run through the pipe per minute. After fifteen minutes, the cleaner has unclogged it enough that 3 ounces can run through per minute. Ten minutes later, the clog is cleared enough for 4 ounces to run through per minute. How many ounces of cleaner were used after 30 minutes?
Answer: For 15 minutes at 2 ounces per minute, 2 * 15 = 30 ounces were used. For the next 10 minutes at 3 ounces per minute, 3 * 10 = 30 ounces were used. There are 30 - 15 - 10 = 5 minutes remaining. For the next 5 minutes at 4 ounces per minute, 4 * 5 = 20 ounces were used. After 30 minutes, 30 + 30 + 20 = 80 ounces of cleaner were used. The answer is 80.
