[Question]Mark has a really bad headache. He takes 2 Tylenol tablets of 500 mg each and he does every 4 hours for 12 hours. How many grams of Tylenol does he end up taking?
[Answer]He takes 12 / 4 = 3 doses. Each dose is 500 * 2 = 1000 mg. So he takes 3 * 1000 = 3000 mg. So he takes 3000 / 1000 = 3 grams of Tylenol. The answer is 3.
Q: Darnell has 1000 square feet of fabric that he's using to make mini flags. He makes square flags that are 4 feet by 4 feet, wide rectangular flags that are 5 feet by 3 feet, and tall rectangular flags that are 3 feet by 5 feet. He has already made 16 square flags, 20 wide flags, and 10 tall flags. How many square feet of fabric does he have left?
A: The square flags use 16 square feet of fabric per flag because four times four equals 16. The wide flags each use 15 feet of fabric per flag because five times three equals 15. The tall flags each use 15 feet of fabric per flag because five times three equals 15. He has used 256 square feet for the square flags because 16 times 16 equals 256. He has used 300 square feet for the wide flags because 20 times 15 equals 300. He has used 150 square feet for the tall flags because ten times 15 equals 150. He has used 706 square feet because 256 plus 300 plus 150 equals 706. He has 294 square feet left because 1,000 minus 706 equals 294. The answer is 294.
Question: Cameron drives at twice the speed of his brother, Chase. But Danielle drives at three times the speed of Cameron. If it takes Danielle 30 minutes to travel from Granville to Salisbury, how long, in minutes, will it take Chase to travel from Granville to Salisbury?
Answer: If Danielle drives at three times the speed of Cameron, it will take Cameron 30 * 3 = 90 minutes for Cameron to travel the same distance. And since Cameron drives at twice the speed of his brother, Chase, it will take Chase 90 * 2 = 180 minutes to travel from Granville to Salisbury. The answer is 180.
[Question]At peak season, 6 packs of tuna fish are sold per hour, while in a low season 4 tuna packs are sold per hour. If each tuna pack is sold at $60, How much more money is made in a day during a high season than a low season if the fish are sold for 15 hours?
[Answer]6 packs of tuna fish are sold per hour. If the sales are made for 15 hours, the total number of packs sold is 4 = 6 * 15 = 90 packs. At $60 per pack, during a high season, the total sales in 15 hours are 90 * $60 = $5400. 4 packs of tuna fish are sold per hour. If the sales are made for 15 hours, the total number of packs sold is 4 * 15 = 60 packs. At $60 per pack, during a low season, the total sales in 15 hours are 60 * $60 = $3600. The amount of money that is made after 15 hours during a high season than a low season is $5400 - $3600 = $1800. The answer is 1800.
Q: A retailer sells any shirt for the same price and any pair of pants for the same price, but the price of shirts and pants are not the same. Say you bought 2 shirts and 3 pairs of pants for $120 in total, then you realized you didn't need the extra pants. What's the price of 1 shirt at this place if when you returned all 3 pairs of pants you were refunded 25% of what you originally paid?
A: If I paid $120 and I was refunded 25% for all the 3 pants, then that means I received 25% * 120 = $30. This means the total price of the 2 shirts was 120 - 30 = 90. The price of one shirt is thus 90 / 2 = 45. The answer is 45.
