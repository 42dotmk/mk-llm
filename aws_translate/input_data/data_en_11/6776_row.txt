[Question]In his first season at Best Hockey's team, Louie scored four goals in the last hockey match of this season. His brother has scored twice as many goals as Louie scored in the last match in each game he's played in each of the three seasons he's been on the team. Each season has 50 games. What is the total number of goals the brothers have scored between them if, in the previous matches, Louie scored 40 goals?
[Answer]If Louie scored 4 goals last night, his brother has scored 2 * 4 goals = 8 goals in each game. The total number of games Louie's brother has played in is 3 seasons * 50 games / season = 150 games. Louie's brother's total number of goals in the three seasons is 8 goals / game * 150 games = 1200 goals. Louie's total number of goals this season is 40 goals + 4 goals = 44 goals. Together, they have a total of 44 goals + 1200 goals = 1244 goals in the team. The answer is 1244.
Q: Last night Kannon had 3 apples, a banana, and 4 oranges for dinner. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, and twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today. How many fruits would she have eaten so far in the two meals?
A: The total number of fruits that Kannon ate last is 3 apples + 1 banana + 4 oranges = 8. Since last night Kannon had 3 apples, today she'll eat 3 + 4 = 7 apples. She is also planning to eat 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, a total of 1 * 10 = 10 bananas. Kannon will also eat twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, which means she'll eat 7 * 2 = 14 oranges. Tonight Kannon will eat 14 oranges + 10 bananas + 7 apples = 31 fruits. In total, after tonight, Kannon would have eaten 31 + 8 = 39 fruits. The answer is 39.
Question: Big Joe is the tallest player on the basketball team. He is one foot taller than Ben, who is one foot taller than Larry, who is one foot taller than Frank, who is half a foot taller than Pepe. If Pepe is 4 feet six inches tall, how tall is Big Joe, in feet?
Answer: Four feet six inches is the same as 4.5 feet tall. If Frank is 0.5 feet taller than Pepe, then he is 4.5 + 0.5 = 5 feet tall. If Larry is one foot taller than Frank, then he is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall. If Ben is one foot taller than Larry, then he is 6 + 1 = 7 feet tall. If Big Joe is one foot taller than Ben, then he is 7 + 1 = 8 feet tall. The answer is 8.
[Question]The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.
[Answer]If the total number of goals scored in the league that season against Barca is 300, the two players scored 20 / 100 * 300 = 60 goals. If the players scored an equal number of goals, each scored 60 / 2 = 30 goals. The answer is 30.
