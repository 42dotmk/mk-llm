Q: Jonah bought 6 pineapples for $3 each. Each pineapple could be cut into 12 pineapple rings. He sold 4 pineapple rings for $5 each. How much profit did Jonah make?
A: Jonah spent 6 x $3 = $18. He made a total of 6 x 12 = 72 pineapple rings. He sold 72 / 4 = 18 sets of pineapple rings. He made 18 x $5 = $90. His profit was $90 - $18 = $72. The answer is 72.
Question: Remi prepared a tomato nursery and planted tomato seedlings. After 20 days, the seedlings were ready to be transferred. On the first day, he planted 200 seedlings on the farm. On the second day, while working alongside his father, he planted twice the number of seedlings he planted on the first day. If the total number of seedlings transferred to the farm on these two days was 1200, how many seedlings did his father plant?
Answer: On the second day, he planted 2 * 200 seedlings = 400 seedlings. The total number of seedlings Remi planted on the two days is 400 seedlings + 200 seedlings = 600 seedlings. If the total number of seedlings transferred from the nursery was 1200 after the second day, Remi's father planted 1200 seedlings - 600 seedlings = 600 seedlings. The answer is 600.
[Question]Andy gets a cavity for every 4 candy canes he eats. He gets 2 candy canes from his parents and 3 candy canes each from 4 teachers. Then he uses his allowance to buy 1/7 as many candy canes as he was given. How many cavities does he get from eating all his candy canes?
[Answer]First find how many candy canes Andy gets from his teachers: 3 canes / teacher * 4 teachers = 12 canes. Then add the number of candy canes he gets from his parents: 12 canes + 2 canes = 14 canes. Then divide that number by 7 to find the number of canes he buys: 14 canes / 7 = 2 canes. Then add the number of candy canes he gets from each source to find the total number: 2 canes + 14 canes = 16 canes. Then divide the total number of candy canes by the number of candy canes it takes to get one cavity to find the number of cavities Andy gets: 16 canes / 4 canes / cavity = 4 cavities. The answer is 16.
Q: Geordie takes a toll road on his drive to work and back every day of his five-day workweek. The toll is $12.50 per car or $7 per motorcycle. Both his car and his motorcycle get 35 miles per gallon of gas and the commute to work is 14 miles. Gas costs him $3.75 per gallon. Geordie drives his car to work three times a week and his motorcycle to work twice a week. How many dollars does he spend driving to work and back on the same route in a week?
A: Geordie pays 12.50 * 3 = $37.50 for car tolls driving to work three times a week. He pays 7 * 2 = $14 for motorcycle tolls driving to work twice a week. He drives 14 * 5 = 70 miles to work each five - day workweek. He uses 70 / 35 = 2 gallons of gas on the drive. He spends 3.75 * 2 = $7.50 on gas each week. Thus, he spends 37.50 + 14 + 7.50 = $59 driving to work. Since he drives to work and back from work, he spends 59 * 2 = $118 a week. The answer is 118.
