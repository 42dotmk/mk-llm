Title: News International (NI) Figure's Secret Influence in Met Commissioner Selection: The Role of Sir Paul Stephenson and Revelations about Sir Hugh Orde

In July 2011, Sir Paul Stephenson stepped down as the Metropolitan (Met) Police Commissioner amidst the turbulent phone-hacking scandal involving Mrs. Rebekah Brooks. Now, new findings shed light on the role a senior News International figure played in swaying the selection process to choose the next Met Commissioner. 

Sir Paul Stephenson resigned from his position in the wake of Mrs. Brooks's arrest, following revelations of phone hacking practices at the News of the World, which she had previously edited. Investigations have since uncovered that a high-ranking News International representative, whose identity has not been disclosed, secretly communicated with No 10, informing them of Mrs. Brooks's preferences for Sir Paul's replacement.

It is of vital importance to note that neither Mrs. Brooks nor former deputy editor of News of the World, Neil Wallis, was the figure involved in the secret exchange. The message conveyed to No 10 disclosed that Mrs. Brooks did not want Sir Hugh Orde, the frontrunner and perceived favorite for the Met Commissioner role, to secure the position.

The involvement of News International in the process raises questions regarding the media conglomerate's influence on key appointments and transparency in the UK public sector. The news also highlights the complex and murky relationships between UK's highest-ranking law enforcement officials and influential media personalities.

Adding another layer to the story, it was the News of the World that exposed a deeply personal issue regarding Sir Hugh Orde. The tabloid ran a story revealing he had fathered a love child, which seemingly aimed to discredit or jeopardize his chances of becoming the Met police commissioner. Whether this was a contributing factor to Mrs. Brooks's disapproval of Sir Hugh remains uncertain, and the motivations behind her preference for someone other than Sir Hugh are unclear.

The secretive communication from the News International figure and Mrs. Brooks's revealed preferences about the Met police chief position draw attention to the possible manipulation and influence of pivotal decision-making processes within law enforcement. These incidents necessitate further inquiry into the matter and raise questions about the integrity of officials, media organizations, and the Police Service as a whole.

Looking ahead, it is essential for the public sector, particularly law enforcement agencies, to regain public trust and establish transparent and objective decision-making mechanisms. Transparency in appointments and impartiality must be of paramount importance, to ensure that the individuals in charge of public safety and order are chosen based on their skills, expertise, and merit rather than through covert machinations of external forces or alliances.

In conclusion, the revelations about undisclosed communication between a high-ranking News International figure and No 10 demonstrate an unsettling example of media influence seeping into the selection process for pivotal law enforcement positions. The implications of these findings emphasize the importance of transparency, impartiality, and accountability in both the media and public sectors. The story of Sir Paul Stephenson's resignation and Sir Hugh Orde's exclusion from the running not only exposes the power dynamics between key law enforcement figures and media giants but also mandates an urgent need for establishing and maintaining standards of integrity in decision-making processes.
