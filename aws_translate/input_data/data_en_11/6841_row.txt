Therefore, arguably, the best time to share this information is during the orientation period. During this time, new employees are usually in the process of learning about the business, the workplace culture, and their specific roles. 

Informing them about your visual impairment early on can increase their understanding of your unique situation while avoiding any misconceptions that might surface if they observe any unusual interactions. Moreover, an early disclosure can foster openness and trust between you and your new employee, which are essential factors in building a strong working relationship.

Begin by explaining your condition. 
When talking about your visual disability, start by explaining what it is. State your condition directly - this could be anything from loss of peripheral vision to total blindness. Keep in mind that the employee may not be familiar with your specific kind of visual impairment, so try to describe it in layman's terms. 

For instance, if you have retinitis pigmentosa, which affects your peripheral vision, you could say, "I have a condition called retinitis pigmentosa, which means that I don't see things that are on the sides or corners. It's kind of like looking through a tunnel." Keeping your explanation clear and straightforward can promote understanding and empathy.

Discuss the nature of your vision impairment with clarity, and specify how and to what extent it affects your daily functioning and work performance. However, also reassure them that despite your disability, you are fully capable of performing your roles and responsibilities.

Describe specifics about your daily work life.
Offer practical examples of how you manage your daily tasks within the workplace given your condition. This will give your employee a clear picture of what your work routine looks like and how their work will intersect with yours. You can talk about the tools and techniques you use, such as using screen reading software or having documents printed in large font sizes. 

Discuss potential challenges and your coping strategies.
Once your employee has a basic understanding of your visual disability, it might be helpful to discuss possible challenges that can occur in the workplace as a result of your condition. Mention any specific scenarios that might be relevant to your roles and responsibilities and disclose how you manage them effectively.

Your transparency will encourage your employees to approach these situations with understanding and flexibility. More importantly, it can teach them how to best support you in these scenarios, fostering a more cooperative and harmonious work environment.

Encourage questions and provide opportunities for open dialogue.
Remember, your discussion should not be a one-way street. After you share information about your visual disability, create opportunities for the employee to offer their thoughts or ask questions. This will encourage open dialogue and facilitate a deeper understanding of your condition. 

The process of engaging in such a conversation might seem daunting, but it has many benefits, including promoting inclusivity, fostering empathy, and building understanding. Being proactive and open about your visual impairment can create a bond of trust and respect between you and your employees, ultimately fostering a supportive and inclusive work environment. 

In conclusion, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to discussing your visual impairment with your employees. The information above provides a general guideline, but you should tailor your conversation to the specific needs of your business and the individual employee.
