Question: A tank contains 6000 liters of water, 2000 liters evaporated, and then 3500 liters were drained by Bob. How many liters are in the tank if it now rains for 30 minutes and every 10 minutes 350 liters of rain are added to the tank?
Answer: After the first evaporation, the water tank has 6000 liters - 2000 liters = 4000 liters. After the second extraction, the water tank has 4000 liters - 3500 liters = 500 liters. The tank is refilled with rain 30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3 times. The amount of water refilled with rain is 3 times * 350 liters per time = 1050 liters. With the additional rainwater, the water tank has 500 liters + 1050 liters = 1550 liters. The answer is 1550.
[Question]Laran has started a poster business. She is selling 5 posters per day at school. Two posters per day are her large posters that sell for $10. The large posters cost her $5 to make. The remaining posters are small posters that sell for $6. They cost $3 to produce. How much profit, in dollars, does Laran make per 5-day school week?
[Answer]The profit made for each large poster is $10 - $5 = $5. Each day Laran earns $5 * 2 = $10 from selling large posters. The profit made for each small poster is $6 - $3 = $3. Each day Laran earns $3 * 3 = $9 from selling small posters. Laran makes a total profit of $10 + $9 = $19 per day. For a 5 day school week, Laran makes a profit of 5 * $19 = $95. The answer is 95.
Q: A Burmese python that was 1.4 meters long swallowed a 50-centimeter alligator. After one week, the alligator was completely digested. If this snake continues to eat 50-centimeter-long alligators at a constant rate of one alligator per week, what is the maximum number of alligators that the snake can eat in 616 days?
A: Since one week is 7 days. 616 days is 616 / 7 = 88 weeks. Since the python eats 1 alligator per week, in 88 weeks it can eat 88 / 1 = 88 alligators. The answer is 88.
Question: John buys 3 boxes of burritos. He gives away a 3rd of them to his friend. Each box has 20 burritos. He eats 3 burritos per day for 10 days. How many burritos does he have left?
Answer: He gave 3 / 3 = 1 box away. So he has 3 - 1 = 2 boxes. So he got 2 * 20 = 40 burritos. He ate 3 * 10 = 30 burritos. So he has 40 - 30 = 10 burritos left. The answer is 10.
[Question]Janice gets paid $10 an hour for the first 40 hours she works each week, and $15 each hour of overtime after that. If Janice works 60 hours one week, how much money does she make?
[Answer]Janice makes during her first 40 hours of work $10 / hour * 40 hours = $400. Janice works 60 hours - 40 hours = 20 hours during her overtime. Janice makes from working overtime $15 * 20 = $300. The total she makes a week is $400 + $300 = $700. The answer is 700.
