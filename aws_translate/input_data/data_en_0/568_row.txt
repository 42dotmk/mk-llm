[Question]Andy gets a cavity for every 4 candy canes he eats. He gets 2 candy canes from his parents and 3 candy canes each from 4 teachers. Then he uses his allowance to buy 1/7 as many candy canes as he was given. How many cavities does he get from eating all his candy canes?
[Answer]First find how many candy canes Andy gets from his teachers: 3 canes / teacher * 4 teachers = 12 canes. Then add the number of candy canes he gets from his parents: 12 canes + 2 canes = 14 canes. Then divide that number by 7 to find the number of canes he buys: 14 canes / 7 = 2 canes. Then add the number of candy canes he gets from each source to find the total number: 2 canes + 14 canes = 16 canes. Then divide the total number of candy canes by the number of candy canes it takes to get one cavity to find the number of cavities Andy gets: 16 canes / 4 canes / cavity = 4 cavities. The answer is 16.
Q: Miles and Daphne are comparing their reading collection and want to figure out who has more pages. They are about to count each page, but their parents suggest that they see whose collection is taller. Mile's collection is taller, but then Daphne notices that Miles reads board books, and so the pages are thicker. After some more measuring, they figure out that for Miles, 1 inch equals 5 pages, but for Daphne 1 inch equals 50 pages. If Miles's books are 240 inches tall and Daphne's collection is 25 inches tall, how many pages are in the longest collection?
A: Miles's collection has 1,200 pages because 240 x 5 = 1,200. Daphne's collection has 1,250 pages because 25 x 50 = 1,250. The largest collection has 1,250 pages because 1,250 > 1,200. The answer is 1250.
Question: Tom weighs 150 kg. He manages to hold 1.5 times his weight in each hand while wearing a weight vest weighing half his weight. How much total weight was he moving with?
