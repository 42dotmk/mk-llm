(Dialogue)

Luck (sitting, checking his phone, glances at the door): Tania should be here any minute now. It's been ages since I last saw her.
(He continues to sip his caramel latte while browsing his phone, occasionally looking up at the door.)

Tania (entering the café with a radiant smile on her face, spots Luck): Luck! Over here!
(She waves to catch his attention as she strides towards him.)

Luck (stands up): Tania, you look great! It's been way too long!
(He steps away from the table and embraces her in a friendly hug.)

Tania (smiling): How have you been? You look like you're doing well!
(She steps back and examines Luck before sitting down.)

Luck (laughing): I've been good, thank you. How about you?

Tania: Well, life's been pretty unpredictable lately. Have you heard about my new job?

Luck (nodding and sipping his latte): Yeah, you mentioned it in your last message. Tell me more about it!

Tania (excitedly sipping her iced tea): I'm working as a graphic designer for an eco-conscious company that creates sustainable products. I get to come up with all the packaging and promotional material designs, which is precisely what I always wanted to do!

Luck: That sounds fantastic, Tania! And it aligns perfectly with your passion for the environment.

Tania (nodding): You're right! Plus, the team I work with is very like-minded and supportive. It's been an exciting journey so far.

Luck: It's great to hear you've found your niche. How's everything else? Family, friends?

Tania (sighs): Well, my parents are doing well. They recently retired, so they're enjoying their free time traveling and indulging in their hobbies. My younger sister is still studying. As for friends, I haven't been in touch with many since I moved. 

Luck (sympathetic): You know, life takes us on different paths. But the real bonds will always find a way to reconnect.

Tania (smiling): That's true. And it's comforting to have you as a friend all these years, Luck.

Luck: You'll always have me around, Tania. You know, I've started mentoring kids in computer programming at the local school.

Tania (impressed): Wow, that's incredible! I had no idea you were doing that. It must be very rewarding.

Luck: It's been a fantastic experience. The kids are eager to learn, and I do my best to encourage their creativity. Seeing them grow and fall in love with coding is so gratifying.

Tania: You always had a knack for teaching others in your unique style. You have so much to give to those kids.

Luck (smiling): Thank you, Tania. That means a lot.

(Both continue chatting and catching up, sharing their journeys and laughing at old memories. Their friendship strengthened by this reunion, the afternoon brings a promise of new chapters and stronger bonds in the coming years.)
