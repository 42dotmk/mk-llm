[ii] Nick is a patient.

It wasn't an ideal situation, but it was the best they could make of it; the closest medical help was miles away. As the morning sun peeked through the dense forest, they found themselves near an abandoned cabin which would have to serve as an impromptu medical facility.

Nick, who was quite pale due to the loss of blood from the deep gash on his leg, winced with every step as they approached the cabin. Ryan, a strong-willed and dependable friend, felt responsible for Nick's injuries. They had been hiking for their annual friends trip when Nick slipped and fell against some sharp rocks, causing the painful wound.

As they entered the dusty cabin, Ryan quickly scanned the space for any useful materials. He managed to find some old towels which he could use to help clean the wound and staunch the bleeding. He sent a silent prayer of thanks to his past self for enrolling in those first aid classes last year.

Ryan washed his hands thoroughly and used some of the bottled water they brought along to moisten the antiseptic wipes from their first aid kit. He carefully cleaned the affected area, trying not to think about how much pain Nick must be in. He then took a deep breath, preparing himself to use the scalpel. It was a daunting prospect, but he knew this was not a task to be rushed.

With surgical precision, Ryan sliced away some of the jagged skin and damaged tissue, careful to leave a clean edge that would promote healing. As he stitched up the wound with a sterilized needle and thread, he was incredibly gentle, knowing that there was no room for error.

Despite the pain and blood loss, Nick remained strong. He could tell that Ryan was doing his best, and he was grateful for his friend's medical knowledge in this desperate situation. The atmosphere in the cabin was tense as they both focused on the task at hand. Ryan continued with the treatment, his hands steady and his dedication intense.

After what seemed like an eternity, Ryan finally tied the last knot on the sutures. The wound was closed. He covered it with a sterile dressing from the first aid kit, securing it in place with some adhesive strips. He then helped Nick elevate his leg and instructed him to rest while he scoured the cabin for anything they could use for a makeshift splint.

They spent the rest of the day in the cabin, with Ryan frequently checking on Nick's wound, making sure it didn't get infected and that the bleeding had subsided. As evening approached, they decided to stay in the cabin overnight, not wanting to risk moving Nick in his current condition. The following day, they would attempt to find their way back to civilization and seek proper medical help.

Throughout this harrowing experience, the bond between Ryan and Nick only grew stronger. It was a testament to their friendship that they could face adversity together and emerge from it even closer than before. In the days that followed, they would always look back on this event with a mix of fear and gratitude, knowing that they had each other's backs no matter what challenges life threw their way.
