[Question]Mary tried to improve her health by changing her diet, but her weight bounced like a yo-yo. At first, she dropped a dozen pounds. Then, she added back twice the weight that she initially lost. Then, she dropped three times more weight than she initially had lost. But finally, she gained back half of a dozen pounds. If she weighed 99 pounds at the start of her change in diet, what was her final weight, in pounds?
[Answer]Since Mary first weighed 99 pounds, after she dropped a dozen pounds she weighed 99 - 12 = 87 pounds. Twice the weight she initially lost is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds. So, when she added back twice the weight that she initially lost, her weight jumped to 87 + 24 = 111 pounds. Three times more than she initially had lost is 12 * 3 = 36 pounds. Therefore, when Mary lost 3 times more than she initially lost, her weight dropped to 111 - 36 = 75 pounds. Finally, when Mary gained back half of a dozen pounds, her final weight was 75 + 6 = 81 pounds. The answer is 81.

[Question]Janet uses her horses' manure as fertilizer. One horse produces 5 gallons of fertilizer per day. Once Janet has collected enough fertilizer, she'll spread it over 20 acres of farmland. Each acre needs 400 gallons of fertilizer and Janet can spread fertilizer over 4 acres per day. If Janet has 80 horses, how long will it take until all her fields are fertilized?
[Answer]First find the total amount of fertilizer the horses produce per day: 5 gallons / horse * 80 horses = 400 gallons. Then multiply the number of acres of farmland by the number of gallons per acre to find the total amount of fertilizer needed: 400 gallons / acre * 20 acres = 8000 gallons. Then divide the total amount of fertilizer needed by the amount of fertilizer produced per day to find the number of days needed to collect fertilizer: 8000 gallons / 400 gallons / day = 20 days. Then divide the total number of acres Janet needs to cover by the number of acres she can cover per day to find how many days it takes her to cover them all: 20 acres / 4 acres / day = 5 days. Then add the time to collect the fertilizer to the time to spread it to find the total time: 5 days + 20 days = 25 days. The answer is 25.

[Question]This year the Oscar swag bags include two diamond earrings that cost $6,000 each, a new iPhone that costs $2,000, and some designer scarves that each cost $1,500. If the total value of the swag bag is $20,000, how many scarves are there?
[Answer]First find the total cost of the diamond earrings: $6,000 / earring * 2 earrings = $12,000. Then subtract the cost of the earrings and iPhone from the total cost of the bags to find the cost of all the scarves: $20,000 - $12,000 - $2,000 = $6,000. Then divide the total cost of the scarves by the cost per scarf to find the number of scarves: $6,000 / $1,500 / scarf = 4 scarves. The answer is 4.
