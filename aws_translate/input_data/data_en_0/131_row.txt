A news anchor apologized Thursday for a comment she made Wednesday about metro Detroit's Arab population. 
  
 At the end of a reporter's story about an alleged ISIS threat that included Michigan, Carmen Harlan, a longtime anchor with NBC affiliate WDIV-TV Local 4, said, “Given the fact that we have the largest Arab population outside of the Middle East, I guess this should not come as a real surprise." 
  
 "You’re exactly right," reporter Kimberly Gill replied. 
  
 Following outrage from Detroit's Muslim and Arab-American communities and progressive groups, Harlan apologized on the air Thursday night. 
  
 “On occasion,” Harlan said, journalists’ words can be “misunderstood.” 
  
 “In no way did I mean to imply that because of our community’s makeup, there was a higher risk of ISIS threats,” she said. “If a misunderstanding occurred, and it must have, that was never my intent. For that, I apologize.” 
  
 “Carmen Harlan did the right thing by apologizing for the remarks she made,” Lonnie Scott, executive director of Progress Michigan, said in a press release. "As a respected journalist who has been a staple in Detroit, we believe Harlan meant no ill will in her comments, but they were still dangerous and needed to be addressed. We appreciate the swift and sincere apology Harlan offered." 
  
 H/T Mediaite ||||| Hip hop's latest beef is over just as it was getting started. Days after they hurled insults at each other on social media, Young Thug and Game have ended their feud. 
  
  
  
 Thugga apologized for the shade he threw towards Game on Instagram last week, in a post he has since deleted. “You was a male stripper once before so I don’t want to fight you. I don’t want no germs from you, pussy n***a,” he told the Compton rapper.

 Now, though, he's had a change of heart seemingly motivated by the #BlackLivesMatter movement. “See the way the world works, they want all Blacks to kill each other. But we’re not. Black lives matter, so I salute Game, I respect him, and I’m sorry for making that post about him,” said Young Thug in a video posted to IG. He couldn't help but adding, “Even though he was wrong and he was in the wrong business, and taking up for a n***a that wasn’t taking up for himself, it’s all good.” 
  
  
  
 Game accepted his apology. “I seen Thuga video and s**t. I think it take a real n***a to apologize and dead some s**t,” he replied on Instagram. 
  
  
  
 Now, Game is even offering to play mediator between Thug and Lil Wayne, and then Weezy and Birdman. “I think the next phase is getting him and Tune s**t buried ’cause Tune my n***a,” said Game. “And then gettin’ Tune and Birdman to settle their s**t and gettin’ back to gettin’ their money.”
