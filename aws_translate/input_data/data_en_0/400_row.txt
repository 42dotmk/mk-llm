Question: The United States flag has 50 stars, one for every state in the union, and 13 stripes, which represent the original 13 colonies. Pete, inspired by history, decided to make his own flag. He used circles, to represent how many scoops of ice cream he can consume in one sitting, and squares, to represent the number of brownies he has hidden beneath his bed. For circles, he used 3 less than half the number of stars on the US flag, and for squares, he used six more than twice the number of stripes on the US flag. What is the combined total number of circles and squares on Pete's flag?
Answer: Half the number of stars on the US flag is 50 / 2 = 25. Three less than half the number of stars on the US flag is 25 - 3 = 22 circles. Twice the number of stripes on the US flag is 13 * 2 = 26. Six more than twice the number of stripes on the US flag is 26 + 6 = 32 squares. In total, Pete's flag has 22 + 32 = 54 circles and squares. The answer is 54.

Question: Lorraine made a pan of brownies and cut them into 16 pieces. Her children ate 25% of the brownies when they got home from school. After dinner, the entire family ate 50% of the remaining brownies. After everyone went to bed, Lorraine ate 1 more brownie. How many brownies are left over?
Answer: Her children ate 25% of the 16 brownies so they ate .25 * 16 = 4 slices. There were 16 brownies and the children ate 4 slices, leaving 16 - 4 = 12 brownies. The family ate 50% of the remaining 12 brownies so they ate .50 * 12 = 6 brownies. There were 12 brownies and they ate 6 which leaves 12 - 6 = 6 brownies. Lorraine had 1 more of the 6 remaining brownies which leaves 6 - 1 = 5 brownies. The answer is 5.
