It is difficult to pinpoint exactly how Casey would feel, as individual reactions vary depending on factors such as personality, the specific situation, and past experiences. However, we can attempt to provide a comprehensive analysis of some possible emotional responses Casey might have in this situation.

1. Relief: In the short term, Casey might experience a sense of relief from avoiding a potentially confronting or uncomfortable interaction with their parents. If they had been feeling particularly anxious or stressed about the prospect of talking to their parents, consciously deciding to avoid them could temporarily alleviate those negative emotions.

2. Guilt: Casey might begin to feel guilty about not talking to their parents, especially if their parents were only attempting to communicate out of genuine concern or love. Guilt can arise from the realization that their avoidance might have hurt their parents emotionally or caused unnecessary misunderstandings and tension in their relationship.

3. Fear: If Casey's avoidance of their parents was due to a fear of conflict or potential negative outcomes, they might continue to feel fear even after avoiding them. This is because they have not resolved the underlying issue and may still worry about what will happen when they eventually have to face their parents.

4. Frustration: Depending on the circumstances, Casey might feel frustrated with themselves for avoiding their parents. They may recognize that their actions were counterproductive and only served to prolong the inevitable confrontation that they will need to face. This frustration could prompt negative thoughts and self-criticism, which may further exacerbate Casey's emotional turmoil.

5. Loneliness: When avoiding close or important relationships, such as family, people can experience feelings of loneliness. Casey could feel isolated and disconnected from their parents, making them long for emotional support and understanding.

6. Regret: Over time, Casey might begin to regret their decision to avoid their parents. This could stem from the realization that open communication and resolution would have been better for everyone involved, instead of prolonging the situation through avoidance.

7. Mixed emotions: It is also highly possible that Casey may experience a combination of these emotions, making their feelings complex and difficult to navigate. They might feel relief in the short term, but this might be accompanied by guilt, fear, or frustration as they continue to avoid addressing the issue with their parents.

In conclusion, Casey's emotional response to avoiding their parents would likely result from a mix of relief, guilt, fear, frustration, loneliness, or regret. It is essential for Casey to recognize and address these emotions in order to work through the situation and foster a healthy relationship with their parents moving forward. Open communication, understanding, and a mutual willingness to resolve the issue will be critical to overcoming these emotional challenges and finding a positive outcome for both Casey and their parents.
