The name of the group formed by Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel in 1957 was called "Tom & Jerry." Here is a detailed history of the duo and their collaboration:

Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel first met in elementary school in Queens, New York, back in the early 1950s. They became friends and bonded over their shared love for music. Both were influenced by the rock and roll and doo-wop sounds that were popular during their youth.

The two friends began to perform together in various school productions. As their musical partnership evolved, they started writing their own songs and formed a duo called "Tom & Jerry" in 1957. At this point, they were only teenagers â€“ Simon was 16 years old, and Garfunkel was 15.

Paul Simon took the stage name "Jerry Landis," inspired by the first name of his girlfriend, Sue Landis, at that time, while Arthur Garfunkel adopted the pseudonym "Tom Graph," referencing his love for mathematics and the fact that he used to track the progress of hit songs on graph paper. 

In 1957, the duo wrote and recorded their first single, "Hey Schoolgirl," which was inspired by the music of their idols, The Everly Brothers. The song managed to capture the attention of Sid Prosen, the owner of an independent record label called Big Records. Prosen believed in the talent of the young duo and offered them a recording contract. Under Prosen's guidance, they released "Hey Schoolgirl," which rapidly gained popularity and managed to reach number 49 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The commercial success of their first single led to appearances on popular television programs, such as "American Bandstand" and "The Alan Freed Show."

However, the duo's success as Tom & Jerry was short-lived as they failed to achieve the same level of commercial success with their following singles. Their relationship with Prosen soured, and the duo decided to disband in order to pursue their individual careers and focus on their college education.

While attending separate colleges, Simon and Garfunkel continued to write songs and performed occasionally. In the early 1960s, folk music experienced a revival, and the duo rekindled their partnership with a new musical direction. Eventually, they abandoned their stage names and began performing under their real names, Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel.

In 1964, they released their debut album as a folk duo named "Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M." The album included their iconic song "The Sound of Silence," which became a massive hit after it was remixed and re-released in 1965.

From that point on, Simon & Garfunkel achieved widespread fame and recognition for their intricate vocal harmonies, poetic lyrics, and evocative melodies. They went on to release a series of successful albums that solidified their place in music history, with hits like "Mrs. Robinson," "Bridge Over Troubled Water," and "Scarborough Fair."

Though Tom & Jerry didn't last long, the partnership between Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel left an undeniable mark on the musical landscape, ultimately becoming one of the most successful and critically acclaimed duos in popular music history.
