As a bonus for fans, Eldridge has gone ahead and created a video tutorial outlining step-by-step instructions on how to get Cara's stunning look for the evening.

Step 1: Research and Design
Before diving into the makeup application process, it is essential for a makeup artist like Lisa Eldridge to research and design a look that would accentuate and complement Cara's natural features. Communicating with the model and understanding her preferences is a key aspect of Lisa's job, and in this case, Cara's courteous and intelligent manner proved to be a major advantage for both.

Step 2: Prepping Cara's Skin
To achieve Cara's radiant complexion, Lisa begins by thoroughly cleansing her face and applying a suitable moisturizer. This step ensures the skin is well-hydrated, creating a flawless canvas for makeup application.

Step 3: Foundation and Concealer
When creating a flawless base, Lisa carefully selects the right shade of foundation and concealer to match Cara's skin tone perfectly. This helps to even out her complexion and hide any blemishes for a seamless finish.

Step 4: Eye Makeup
Evidently, the main focus of the makeup look for the W Magazine party is Cara's striking eye makeup. Lisa skillfully applies a blend of sultry shades to the lid, gradually building up to a stunning, smoky eye effect. Next, she lines Cara's upper and lower lash lines with a dark grey eyeliner for added intensity.

Step 5: Brows and Lashes
Capitalizing on Cara's iconic bold brows, Lisa enhances them by filling in any gaps with a precise brow pencil. This adds definition and shape to the overall makeup look. Moving on, Lisa curls Cara's lashes, giving them a lift and making her eyes appear more open. For gorgeous, fluttery lashes, Lisa completed this step by applying two coats of mascara to Cara's upper and lower lashes.

Step 6: Blush and Highlighter
To add warmth and dimension to Cara's face, Lisa opts for a soft pink blush and applies it on the apples of her cheeks. She then swipes a subtle highlighter on the high points of her cheekbones for a subtle glow.

Step 7: Lips
Lastly, to complete the entire makeup look, Lisa defines Cara's lips with a matching lip liner, followed by applying a gorgeous nude lipstick for a soft yet sophisticated finish.

By capturing this process in a video tutorial, Lisa Eldridge graciously shares her makeup prowess with Cara Delevingne's fans who can now recreate the stunning look at home. This collaboration between two remarkable and talented women showcases the importance of mutual respect, strong communication, and expertise within the beauty industry, inspiring countless followers to pursue their own creative endeavors.
