Question: Karen’s work tote bag is twice the weight of her husband Kevin’s briefcase when the briefcase is empty. When Kevin puts his laptop and work papers in his briefcase, it is twice the weight of Karen’s tote. Kevin’s work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase. If Karen’s tote weighs 8 pounds, how many more pounds does Kevin’s laptop weigh than Karen’s tote?
Answer: Kevin’s full briefcase is 2 * 8 = 16 pounds. His empty briefcase is 8 / 2 = 4 pounds. The contents of his briefcase weigh 16 - 4 = 12 pounds. His work papers weigh 12 / 6 = 2 pounds. Thus, his laptop weighs 12 - 2 = 10 pounds. Therefore, Kevin’s laptop weighs 10 - 8 = 2 pounds more than Karen’s tote. The answer is 2.
[Question]Selene buys two instant cameras at $110 and three digital photo frames at $120 each. She gets a 5% discount on all the items she purchased. How much does she pay in all?

[Question]When the strawberries at Fruity Farm are ready for harvest, Miguel charges each interested picker $4 to access the strawberry fields. Once there, people pick as many strawberries as they wish, and then take them to Miguel for weighing and pricing. This year, the standard price of a pound of strawberries is $20. Miguel is a very generous man. He deducts the entrance charge from the cost of the harvest. Sally, Jenny and Moses have just finished their strawberry picking and are headed home. They paid $128 for their harvest. How many pounds of strawberry did they pick?
[Answer]To gain entry into the strawberry fields, Sally, Jenny and Moses paid a total of 4 * 3 = 12 dollars. This means that before Miguel applied the $12 discount, the cost was 128 + 12 = 140 dollars. We get the weight by dividing the cost by the price of strawberries per pound, 140 / 20 = 7 pounds. The answer is 7.
