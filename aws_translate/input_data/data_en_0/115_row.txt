Question: Tobias is a tractor salesman. His salary is based on the number of tractors he sells. For every red tractor he sells, he gets paid 10% of the sales price for each tractor. For every green tractor he sells, he gets paid 20% of the sales price for each tractor. This week, he sold 2 red tractors and 3 green tractors. The price of a single red tractor is $20,000. This week, Tobias's salary was $7000. What is the full price of a single green tractor, in dollars?
Answer: For red tractors, 10% of the sales price is 10 / 100 * $20,000 = $2000. By selling two red tractors, he earned 2 * $2000 = $4000. Thus, of the $7000 salary he was paid this week, $7000 - $4000 = $3000 is from sales of green tractors. And since he sold three green tractors, the commission for the sale of a single green tractor is $3000 / 3 = $1000,. If $1000 is 20% of the full price, then the full price for a green tractor is (100 / 20) * $1000 = $5000. The answer is 5000.
[Question]Five adults and two children go to see a movie and buy $12 worth of concessions. The total cost of their trip is $76. If each child's ticket is $7, how much, in dollars, are the adult tickets?
[Answer]First take out the cost of the concessions. That leaves $76 - $12 = $64 for the movie tickets. Each child ticket costs $7, so two children's tickets cost $7 per child ticket * 2 child tickets = $14. To find the amount spent on adult tickets, subtract the cost of the children's tickets to get $64 - $14 = $50 for adult tickets. Divide $50 for adult tickets / 5 adults = $10 per adult ticket. The answer is 10.
Q: It’s Meghan’s turn to pick up her team's coffee order. She needs 2 drip coffees that are $2.25 each and one double shot espresso that’s $3.50. She needs 2 lattes that are $4.00 and needs to add vanilla syrup to one of those for an additional $0.50. She also needs 2 cold brew coffees that are $2.50 each and 1 cappuccino for $3.50. How much is the coffee order?
A: She needs 2 drip coffees that are $2.25 each so 2 * 2.25 = $4.50. She needs 2 lattes that are $4.00 each so 2 * 4 = $8.00. She needs 2 cold brew coffees that are $2.50 each so 2 * 2.50 = $5.00. So the drips are $4.50, lattes are $8.00 plus $0.50 for syrup, cold brew is $5.00, a double shot for $3.50 and a cappuccino for $3.50 for a total of 4.50 + 8.00 + .50 + 5.00 + 3.50 + 3.50 = $25.00. The answer is 25.
