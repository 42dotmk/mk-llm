(1). physical previously done was still valid.

The doctor told the man a physical was not necessary for the insurance policy, because the physical previously done was still valid. This came as a relief to the man, who was anxious about the prospect of undergoing yet another round of medical testing. He had been through a comprehensive physical examination just a few months ago when he switched jobs and enrolled in a new healthcare plan. This examination had included an extensive array of tests, which helped provide a detailed overview of his current health status.

The physical examination had begun with an evaluation of his vital signs, including his blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, and temperature. The doctor had carefully inspected his skin, hair, and nails, searching for any signs of an underlying issue such as rashes, infections, or unusual growths. He had checked his eyes, ears, and nose, employing various tools like the ophthalmoscope and otoscope to examine their function and overall health.

Next, the man had been subjected to a thorax and lung examination, during which the doctor had employed a stethoscope to listen for any abnormalities, such as wheezing or crackling sounds, that might indicate a respiratory issue. His heart and blood vessels had also been closely scrutinized, with special attention being paid to the rhythm, strength, and regularity of his pulse. To evaluate his gastrointestinal system, the doctor had palpated his abdomen, probing for any signs of tenderness, swelling, or organ enlargement.

Moreover, the man had been required to undergo a series of laboratory tests, including blood work to evaluate his levels of cholesterol, glucose, and various other biomarkers, as well as a urinalysis to check for potential issues involving his kidneys and urinary system. Additional tests, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a chest X-ray, had been performed to further assess the functioning of his heart and lungs, respectively.

Once his musculoskeletal system had been assessed for its range of motion, strength, and flexibility, the doctor had rounded up the examination by evaluating his neurological system, testing his reflexes, coordination, and sensory response. Finally, after the man had endured a lengthy and exhaustive evaluation, the doctor had deemed his overall health to be in good standing and had subsequently cleared him, indicating that there were no significant medical issues to concern himself or his insurers with.

As a result of the thorough physical examination he had recently undergone, the insurance policy did not require a new round of medical testing. The man was relieved that he could avoid the inconvenience and discomfort often associated with such examinations, and he felt more confident in being able to secure the insurance policy he desired. With the all-clear from the doctor, he proceeded with the application process, grateful for the comprehensive physical examination that had already been conducted and satisfied in knowing that his insurance policy would be built upon a solid foundation of his current health status.
