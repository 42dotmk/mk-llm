In order to determine if the conclusion is true, we must analyze the premise and the hypothesis separately, and then examine their relationship.

Premise:
"If the firm has not made a sound business case, or has been unable to deliver on one or more of the business case factors, it faces a very real prospect of failure-the customer may walk away."

In this premise, we can understand that the firm's likelihood of failing is contingent upon its ability to make and execute a sound business case. The consequence of not doing so is that customers (who provide revenue and profits for the firm) might decide to leave, negatively impacting the firm's performance.

Hypothesis:
"The firm might fail if it can't show stockholders that it performs well."

In this hypothesis, we see a potential cause of failure for the firm is the inability to demonstrate strong performance to its stockholders. Stockholders, unlike the customers mentioned in the premise, are investors in the firm and have a vested interest in the company's performance. If a firm's performance is poor, stockholders might lose confidence, leading to a decrease in stock prices or reluctance to continue supporting the firm, which could consequently lead to failure.

Now let's examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.

The premise mainly deals with the firm's ability to make and deliver a sound business case to maintain its customer base, whereas the hypothesis focuses on the importance of showing strong performance to stockholders. Both factors are crucial for the firm's overall success, but they target different audiences (customers vs. stockholders) and there isn't a direct causal relationship between them.

However, it is important to consider that there could be some overlap between the premise and the hypothesis. A sound business case might assist the firm in demonstrating strong performance to stockholders, as a well-executed business case can lead to increased revenues, profitability, market share, or any number of factors that indicate success to investors. Conversely, if the firm were to suffer from customer attrition after neglecting its business case, such performance could be reflected in the company's stock prices, which stockholders would undoubtedly notice.

In summary, while there isn't a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, there are indirect connections that could potentially link the two. If the firm's inability to make a sound business case results in poor financial outcomes and threatens its viability, it could also affect perceptions among stockholders, thereby leading to potential failure. However, it's essential to recognize that the premise and the hypothesis each contribute to different aspects of a firm's success and should be viewed through these separate lenses. As such, it would be overly simplistic to conclude that if the premise is true, so is the hypothesis. Both premises should rather be interpreted as components within a broader context of factors impacting the viability and potential for failure in a firm.
