Reasoning and answer: Since Onur bikes 250 kilometers in a day, he bikes 5 * 250 = 1250 kilometers for five days in a week. Onur's friend Hanil bikes 40 more kilometers in a day than Onur, meaning he bikes for 250 + 40 = 290 kilometers. In five days of the week, Hanil covers 290 * 5 = 1450 kilometers. In total, the two bikes for 1450 + 1250 = 2700 kilometers in 5 days of a week.
The answer: 2700

If there are 3 identical cylindrical structures, with a combined total of 72 rooms, then each individual cylindrical structure contains 72 / 3 = 24 rooms. In each 24 - room cylindrical structure, there are 24 - 12 - 7 = 5 kitchens. Thus, the entire, three - cylinder space station contains a total of 3 * 5 = 15 kitchens.
The answer: 15
Reverse engineering the question: The space station, Lupus-1, is an enormous spacecraft made up of three identical cylindrical structures that house the living quarters for the crew.  The three cylindrical structures are linked together by a series of tunnels that hold them together and allow the crew to move between cylinders. Each cylindrical structure contains 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and several kitchens. If the entire space station has 72 rooms, how many kitchens are there on the entire space station?

Reasoning and answer: Reversing the steps to obtain the amount she spent at the supermarket, $50 less than $350 is $350 - $50 = $300. If $300 was thrice the amount she spent at the supermarket, then the amount spent at the supermarket was $300 / 3 = $100. In addition to what she spent fixing her auto, she spent $100 + $350 = $450 altogether.
The answer: 450

Reasoning and answer: On the bus, the number of Dutch people was 3 / 5 of the total number, a total of 3 / 5 * 90 = 54 people. Out of the 54 people who were Dutch, 1 / 2 were Dutch Americans, a total of 1 / 2 * 54 = 27 people. If 1 / 3 of the passengers on the bus identifying as Dutch Americans sat at the windows, their number is 1 / 3 * 27 = 9.
The answer: 9
