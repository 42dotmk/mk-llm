[Question]Martin rings the small bell 4 times more than 1/3 as often as the big bell. If he rings both of them a combined total of 52 times, how many times does he ring the big bell?
[Answer]Let s be the number of times the small bell rings, and b be the number of times the big bell rings. We know that s + b = 52 and s = 4 + 1 / 3b. Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get 4 + 1 / 3b + b = 52. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 1 / 3b + b = 48. Combining like terms, we get 4 / 3b = 48. Dividing both sides of the equation by 4 / 3, we get b = 36. The answer is 36.
Q: Two puppies, two kittens, and three parakeets were for sale at the pet shop. The puppies were three times more expensive than the parakeets, and the parakeets were half as expensive as the kittens. If the cost of one parakeet was $10, what would it cost to purchase all of the pets for sale at the pet shop, in dollars?
A: Puppies cost three times more than parakeets, or 3 * $10 = $30 per puppy. Parakeets were half as expensive as the kittens, or 2 * $10 = $20 per kitten. Two puppies cost 2 * $30 = $60. Two kittens cost 2 * $20 = $40. And three parakeets cost 3 * $10 = $30. Thus, the cost to purchase all of the pets for sale at the pet shop is $60 + $40 + $30 = $130. The answer is 130.
Question: Rex is taking lessons for his driver’s license. He wants to take 40 hour-long lessons before his test, and decides to have two-hour sessions twice a week until he has done his test. After 6 weeks, how many more weeks will Rex need to continue taking lessons to reach his goal?
Answer: Each week, Rex is taking 2 hour - long lessons * 2 times a week = 4 lessons. After 6 weeks, he has done 4 lessons per week * 6 weeks = 24 lessons. So Rex still needs 40 total lessons – 24 lessons taken = 16 lessons. He will therefore need lessons for another 16 lessons / 4 lessons per week = 4 weeks. The answer is 4.
[Question]Kekai is running a sundae booth at the carnival. On Monday, he makes a total of 40 sundaes, and he puts 6 m&ms on each sundae. On Tuesday, he makes a total of 20 sundaes, and he puts 10 m&ms on each sundae. If each m&m pack contains 40 m&ms, how many m&m packs does Kekai use?
[Answer]On Monday, Kekai uses 40 * 6 = 240 m&ms. On Tuesday, Kekai uses 20 * 10 = 200 m&ms. Kekai uses a total of 240 + 200 = 440 m&ms. Kekai uses a 440 / 40 = 11 m&m packs. The answer is 11.
