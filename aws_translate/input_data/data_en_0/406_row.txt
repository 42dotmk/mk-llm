Input: Question: What form of government did the place Palma was born in have at the time of her birth? Passage 1:Although originally proposed to the French space agency CNES, it was considered too complex and expensive for a single national programme. Its acceptance within the European Space Agency's scientific programme, in 1980, was the result of a lengthy process of study and lobbying. The underlying scientific motivation was to determine the physical properties of the stars through the measurement of their distances and space motions, and thus to place theoretical studies of stellar structure and evolution, and studies of galactic structure and kinematics, on a more secure empirical basis. Observationally, the objective was to provide the positions, parallaxes, and annual proper motions for some 100,000 stars with an unprecedented accuracy of 0.002Â arcseconds, a target in practice eventually surpassed by a factor of two. The name of the space telescope, "Hipparcos" was an acronym for High Precision Parallax Collecting Satellite, and it also reflected the name of the ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus, who is considered the founder of trigonometry and the discoverer of the precession of the equinoxes (due to the Earth wobbling on its axis).
 Passage 2:In 2017, it was announced that Ring of Honor had signed Gresham to a contract. In April 2017, Gresham teamed with Chris Sabin where they defeated Cheeseburger and Will Ferrara.

Gresham took part of the Honor Rumble in 2017. On the September 9th, 2017 episode of Ring Of Honor, Search and Destroy defeated The Bullet Club. At Final Battle, Gresham defeated Josh Woods in a pre-show dark match. Gresham then went on to lose to Jay Lethal at Honor Reigns Supreme and to Chuckie T at Supercard of Honor XII.
