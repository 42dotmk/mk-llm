Title: Tara's Expedition: Discovering the Depths of Oceans and the Novel Biodiversity of Plankton

Between the years 2009 and 2013, making her way through volatile weather conditions, financial hurdles, and even the looming menace of pirates, a 110-foot schooner named Tara circumnavigated the entire globe. Endowed with a challenging but crucial mission, the Tara expedition collected plankton samples from more than 200 diverse locations scattered throughout the world's oceans. Some of these sites dove an impressive 6,500 feet into the ocean's depths, according to a report from Science magazine.

The organisms collected in this wide-ranging expedition produce approximately half the world's oxygen— an unassuming yet important task undertaken by a diverse group of beings that include microscopic plants and animals, fish larvae, bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms, as reported by Reuters.

The resultant findings from the Tara voyage have flooded scientists with a trove of new information and, perhaps more excitingly, unprecedented microbial biodiversity. According to the BBC, the collected samples revealed around 5,000 virus "communities", an astounding 35,000 different bacterial species, and a breathtaking 150,000 different kinds of protozoa, or single-celled plants and animals. 

Excitingly, Dr. Chris Bowler, a scientist at Paris' National Center for Scientific Research, reported that "There are about 11,000 formally described species of plankton—we have evidence for at least 10 times more than that." It’s believed that the majority of these discoveries have not yet been identified, making the database a gold mine for scientific discovery.

However, the Tara expedition team has only scratched the iceberg's tip. Only 579 of the estimated 35,000 plankton samples collected have been thoroughly examined due to the time-consuming nature of the analysis process, notes the BBC.

In addition to this, Tara Expeditions has successfully conducted what it refers to as the "largest DNA sequencing effort ever done for ocean science." The outcome was the discovery of 40 million different genes. Surprisingly, only 20% of these genes were previously recognized, making this a significant advancement in the understanding of marine genomes.

An intriguing common aspect among many of the collected organisms is their sensitivity to mercury changes. As global temperatures increase due to climate change, it could significantly impact these vital microscopic communities. "With changing temperatures as a result of climate change, we are likely to see changes in this community," stated Dr. Bowler, emphasizing the direct impact of human activities on the ocean's biodiversity and ecosystem.

In conclusion, the Tara expedition stands as an embodiment of resilience and the spirit of discovery, encapsulating a pursuit of understanding the vast, hidden world below the surface of our oceans. It has set the stage for a deeper comprehension of our marine ecosystem, the delicate balance within which it operates, and the profound need for its preservation in light of climate change.
