To accomplish the goal of prepping sushi rice prior to boiling it, the optimum option is:

a). Rinse under cold water till it runs clear.

Here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how to properly prepare sushi rice prior to boiling it:

1. Measure the sushi rice: Begin by measuring the desired amount of sushi rice you want to prepare. It is advised to use a measuring cup for accuracy.

2. Place the sushi rice in a bowl or fine-mesh strainer: To rinse the rice properly, place it in a large bowl or, if available, a fine-mesh strainer. This will allow you to wash away any dust and excess starch present in the rice.

3. Rinse the sushi rice under cold water: Hold the bowl or strainer under cold running water. Gently swish the rice around with your hands, allowing the water to work its way through the grains. Remember to be gentle during this process as sushi rice is delicate and can easily break apart.

4. Drain the water and continue rinsing: If using a fine-mesh strainer, allow the water to drain away, then continue to rinse under cold water. If using a bowl, carefully pour the water out and refill the bowl with more cold water. Repeat the rinsing process until the water runs clear. This may involve rinsing 5-7 times depending on the rice quality.

5. Allow the rice to drain and rest: Once the water runs clear, let the sushi rice drain in a fine-mesh strainer for 15-20 minutes. This will help remove any excess water as well as allow the rice to rest and "air out" before cooking.

6. Cook the sushi rice: To boil the sushi rice, you can use either a rice cooker or a pot on the stove. Follow the cooking instructions and add the appropriate water to rice ratio, which is generally 1 cup of rice to 1.2 cups of water for sushi rice. Be sure to refer to the specific recommendations on the sushi rice packaging as the water ratio may vary.

7. Let the cooked rice stand: After the boiling process, allow the sushi rice to stand and steam in the pot for an additional 10-15 minutes with the lid on. This will help ensure that the texture of the rice remains consistent and the grains are fully cooked.

8. Mix the sushi rice with sushi vinegar: While still warm, transfer the cooked sushi rice to a large flat dish or a wooden sushi oke (rice mixing tub). Gently break apart any large clumps using a wooden rice paddle or spatula. Gradually add sushi vinegar (a mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, and salt) and gently mix it with the rice using horizontal cutting motions. Be careful not to squish the rice grains during this process.

9. Cool the sushi rice: Once the sushi vinegar has been evenly mixed with the rice, use a rice paddle or spatula to lift and turn the rice gently to help it cool more evenly. A fan can be used to assist in cooling and adding a subtle shine to the rice. Be mindful not to let the rice become too cold, as it is essential for sushi-making to use rice that is close to room temperature.

Now, your sushi rice is prepped and ready to be used in your sushi dishes. Remember to keep the rice covered with a damp cloth when not in use to prevent it from drying out.
