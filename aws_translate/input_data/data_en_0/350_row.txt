We were writing about the tomboy for the story instead of the plane because the plane was inanimate. While both the tomboy and the plane are interesting subjects, our focus in this particular story was to develop rich and multifaceted characters with personal struggles, aspirations, and growth. Since a tomboy is a human character, she can induce emotions and empathy in the audience, allowing for a more engaging story.

Concentrating on a human character like the tomboy offers numerous benefits compared to highlighting an inanimate object like the plane. Firstly, human characters have emotions, thoughts, and different perspectives, enabling us to create a more diverse and intricate narrative. The tomboy's character arc can be shaped by her experiences and interactions with other characters in the story, providing opportunities for the complexities of human relationships to be explored. This would be difficult to accomplish if the central character were an inanimate object like the plane, as it lacks emotions and the ability to communicate through speech.

Secondly, it is easier for readers to relate to and empathize with human characters. Audiences find it easier to become emotionally invested in a story when they can find aspects of their own lives mirrored in the characters. In the case of the tomboy, readers might identify with her struggles to find her identity, cope with societal expectations, or forge meaningful relationships with those around her. This emotional resonance might be lost if the plane were at the center of the story, as it would be more challenging to convey its significance to readers in a relatable manner.

Furthermore, concentrating on the tomboy allows for a richer exploration of themes and messages. Human characters are capable of growth, change, and development over time, which encourages them to confront their flaws, learn from their mistakes, and persevere in the face of adversity. Such character arcs inspire readers and provoke thought about our own capacity for growth and transformation. But when we focus on an inanimate object like the plane, these themes of personal growth and resilience can become diluted or lost altogether.

On the other hand, the plane could still play a vital role in the story. As a backdrop or plot device, the plane can contribute to the story's setting, create conflict for the characters, and shape the course of the narrative. For example, it could serve as a means of transportation for the tomboy on a life-changing journey, or as a potent symbol of her yearning for freedom and escape from societal pressures.

In conclusion, we opted to write about the tomboy instead of the plane because the plane was inanimate. It was crucial for our story to have a character that could engage the reader emotionally through relatable experiences and personal growth. The tomboy offered the depth and complexity that our narrative demanded, while the plane remained a valuable supporting element in the story. Overall, we believed this choice would create a more captivating and thought-provoking story for our audience to enjoy.
