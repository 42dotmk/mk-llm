By. Toby Harnden. President Barack Obama appears to be clinging to wafer-thin leads in most swing states, but Mitt Romney's decision to pull staffers out of North Carolina is a sign of his campaign's increasing confidence. Romney is now ahead in most Florida polls and ahead or level in Virginia, as Obama appears to be just leading in Ohio. The Republican nominee needs at least two of these states to win while three would probably guarantee 270 electoral college votes and victory. Lead: Romney, seen exchanging pleasantries with Obama during this week's debate, is pulling his staff out of North Carolina - an indication that he expects to win there. Obama won North Carolina, traditionally a Republican state, very narrowly in 2008. The Democratic convention was held there in part to bolster his standing in the state. The Charlotte News & Observer reported that Romney spokesman Robert Reid was one of the staff moving. 'With the increasingly widening polls in North Carolina, we will continue to allocate resources, including key senior staff, to other states,' Michael Levoff, another Romney spokesman, told the paper. Favourability: Latest poll numbers show Romney leading Obama in key states like North Carolina and Florida. But Romneyâ€™s campaign is still spending on ads in North Carolina, and the campaign did not say how many staffers are actually being moved. Romney is up by 5.6 per cent in North Carolina in the RealClearPolitics (RCP) average. The National Journal has reported that Obamaâ€™s campaign, worried about North Carolina, Virginia  and Florida, is 'circling the wagons around Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire  and Nevada.' Romney is up 2.5 per cent in Florida in the RCP average and tied in Virginia, though each of the last three polls there have given him a narrow edge. All smiles: Ann Romney stands while President Obama and Mitt Romney shake hands during the 67th annual Al Smith dinner at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York on Thursday night. Obama is up 2.5 per cent in the RCP average in Ohio, a considerable tightening since the first presidential debate more than a fortnight ago, when Romney dominated. Two new polls from Public Policy Polling show a much tighter race in Iowa and New Hampshire, with Romney holding a 1-point lead - 49  per cent to 48 per cent - over Obama in both. Previous PPP surveys showed Obama up four points in Iowa and up six points in New Hampshire. Laughing all the way to the White House: Obama and Romney share a joke with New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan during the annual Al Smith dinner which has been attended by presidents since World War II. The candidates are now tied nationally at 47 per cent, according to the RCP average, which estimated Obama has a statistically insignificant 0.1 per cent national lead. To underline the fluid picture, a Republican poll in Pennsylvania - a state Romney had all but conceded - put their candidate four points ahead. That prompted the scheduling of a rally by Representative Paul Ryan, Romney's vice-presidential running mate, in Pittsburgh.
