The sentence "Tornadoes from thunderstorms are a risk, especially in the eastern part of the state." does not directly answer the question "What protects the western piedmont from tornadoes?" However, it does provide some contextual information that can lead to a better understanding of why tornadoes might be less frequent in the western piedmont area.

To answer the original question, it is important to consider various factors that may provide some level of protection or contribute to the reduced risk of tornadoes in the western piedmont. These factors may include:

1. Topography: The western part of the piedmont region typically has a more varied and hilly terrain compared to the flatter areas in the eastern part of the state. This terrain can have a disrupting effect on the formation and path of tornadoes, as the airflow can become disrupted or redirected by hills and valleys. As a result, tornadoes may be less likely to occur in areas with a more complex topography.

2. Climate: The climate in the western piedmont region can also play a role in tornado development, or lack thereof. It may be characterized by weather conditions that are less conducive to the formation of severe thunderstorms, which are necessary for tornadoes to form. Differences in temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure between the western piedmont and the eastern part of the state can limit the formation and intensity of thunderstorms.

3. Prevailing wind patterns: Wind patterns can play a significant role in the development of tornadoes. In some regions, the wind patterns may help to steer atmospheric disturbances and thunderstorms to certain areas, while providing protection to other areas. It is possible that the western piedmont may be less prone to tornadoes due to prevailing wind patterns that reduce the likelihood of severe thunderstorms in the region.

4. Proximity to weather systems: The location of the western piedmont in relation to major weather systems, such as frontal boundaries, jet streams, and low-pressure systems, can influence the likelihood of tornadoes. If the western piedmont is less prone to interacting with such weather systems, it may experience fewer tornadoes than other areas.

5. Urban modification: Lastly, though not a natural protection, urban development and land use changes can also impact the likelihood of a tornado forming or tracking across a specific area. The western piedmont may have more forests, parks, or agricultural lands that serve as barriers to tornado development. This added protection could result in a lower tornado risk compared to the eastern part of the state.

In conclusion, while the given sentence does not explicitly address the factors protecting the western piedmont from tornadoes, it provides an indirect clue by mentioning a higher risk of tornadoes in the eastern part of the state. To answer the question comprehensively, one must consider topography, climate, prevailing wind patterns, proximity to weather systems, and urban modification that contribute to the reduced risk of tornadoes in the western piedmont.
