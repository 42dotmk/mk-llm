Title: The Denver Post Seeks Journalist to Cover Marijuana Scene, But There's a Catchâ€¦

The Denver Post is on the lookout for a talented and enthusiastic journalist to join their team and cover the ever-growing marijuana scene in the United States and Canada. With recent legalization battles taking place across North America, this is a story that continues to develop and unfold, making it a critical beat for many news organizations. However, before you start imagining a laid-back lifestyle and puffing away at work, there's a catch: The successful candidate must pass a drug test.

This opportunity to become a marijuana journalist - or cannabis correspondent, as some are calling it - has many intrigued, including Washington Post reporter Christopher Ingraham, who tweeted about the position saying, "DREAM JOB SIREN." The chosen journalist will cover stories for the Denver Post's dedicated marijuana news website, the Cannabist.

The Cannabist, launched in 2013, has become a prominent source of news, culture, and information about marijuana. As the legal cannabis industry expands across the United States and Canada, the demand for well-rounded coverage of the rapidly changing landscape also grows. This is where the talented new hire will need to step in, taking on the responsibility of reporting on the ongoing legalization battles and any other cannabis-related topics that may arise.

However, don't be too quick to assume this job posting is a stoner's dream. The advertisement for the position takes a firm stance on drug testing, stating, "As with every Denver Post position, a qualified candidate must successfully pass a drug test." This requirement means that even though the journalist will be covering stories about cannabis, they cannot partake in the very subject they report on.

So, who is the ideal candidate for this unique position? The Denver Post is looking for a data journalist who has experience creating maps, charts, and graphs. Such skills will be crucial for presenting information about the marijuana industry, legislation, and consumer trends in a clear, engaging, and visual manner.

The person selected for this role will be diving into the complexities of the legal cannabis industry, exploring how it is evolving and the impact of related policies, economic shifts, and social changes. They will be at the forefront of reporting on matters that are shaping public opinion, influencing business decisions, and affecting everyday lives. In short, this is an opportunity to become a part of history as it unfolds, contributing to a greater understanding of the marijuana landscape both nationally and internationally.

Despite the drug test requirement, this position offers a unique opportunity for a skilled and passionate journalist to cover a rapidly evolving industry and become a significant voice in the ongoing narrative surrounding cannabis. For the right candidate, it could indeed be the "DREAM JOB" that many could only hope for. But for those stoners who just cannot resist indulging in the subject matter, it might be worth considering a different career path.
