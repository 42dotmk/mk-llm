Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to discuss a matter concerning security access to the body shop for our maintenance team. Our team is scheduled to perform routine maintenance and repairs on the production equipment starting next Monday.

I kindly request you to grant the necessary security access to the maintenance team members, as they will require entry to the body shop for the duration of the maintenance work, which is estimated to take three days. You can find the list of team members and their respective identification numbers attached to this email.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or if there are any issues we need to address before granting access. I am more than happy to work with you to ensure a smooth process and maintain the security of our facility.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
