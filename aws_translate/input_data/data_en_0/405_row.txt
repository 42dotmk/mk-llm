The statement "Soccer is boring and scores very little points" is a subjective opinion and cannot be inferred from the given information regarding the Netherlands failing to reach the 2018 World Cup finals and their previous successes in 2010 and 2014. 

It is true that soccer, or football as it is known in most parts of the world, is a sport in which scoring is generally low compared to other sports. However, this does not mean that soccer is inherently boring or uneventful. Rather, it is important to understand various aspects of the sport that contribute to its global popularity and the excitement it generates.

Firstly, soccer is a fast-paced sport wherein teams must constantly adapt to various in-game situations. The lack of frequent stoppages and constant action in soccer adds to the excitement of the game. Soccer matches are played in two 45-minute halves, with limited interruptions, which allows for a continuous flow of play. This flow can create tense and thrilling situations throughout a match, even if scoring is relatively rare.

Secondly, the lower scoring nature of soccer places a higher emphasis on the importance of each goal. As a result, scoring opportunities and goals carry a certain weight and significance that may not be present in other sports with higher scoring. This often results in intense efforts from both teams trying to capitalize on every potential scoring chance, resulting in a high level of competitiveness and excitement for fans.

Additionally, soccer is a globally popular sport that attracts millions of fans due to its accessibility, simplicity, and diverse range of talented players and teams. The sport transcends cultural, linguistic, and geographical boundaries, creating a shared global interest. This shared interest generates a vibrant atmosphere in stadiums and watching parties, where fans come together to support their respective teams, adding to the excitement of the matches.

Furthermore, soccer has a rich history and iconic moments, from thrilling goals to monumental upsets that have captivated the world. The sport has produced numerous legendary players and teams that have inspired generations of fans. These moments add layers of emotion and passion to the sport, creating narratives that contribute to the overall appeal of soccer.

Lastly, major international tournaments, such as the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship, add a competitive element and a sense of national pride to the sport. These events captivate entire countries and bring a sense of unity between people who may otherwise have little in common.

In conclusion, while it is accurate to say that soccer generally experiences lower scoring in comparison to certain other sports, it is not valid to infer that the sport is boring as a direct result. The excitement and appeal of soccer rely on a multitude of factors, including its fast pace, global popularity, rich history, and high-stakes competitions. Soccer is a beloved sport for millions of fans worldwide, and the low scoring nature of the game only adds to the suspense and significance of each goal.
