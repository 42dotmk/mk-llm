Title: The $50 Cycle Chase

Plot:

1. Setting: Our story is set in the bustling city of San Francisco, where two brothers, Dante and Liam, share a small apartment. They come from a humble background, but their dreams are big, especially Liam's dream of entering the National Cycling Championship.

Step 1 Justification: Strong plots often involve personal dreams or goals. Setting a clear goal (Liam's need for a professional bike) can drive the story forward and motivate character actions.

2. Initial Situation: Dante, older of the two, is a small-time conman, while Liam is a bicycle courier with a passion for cycling. They barely make ends meet but Liam has been steadily saving money for a championship-grade racing bicycle.

Step 2 Justification: By setting up the initial situation, we demonstrate the brothers' personalities, ambitions, and the origins of the tension between them.

3. Trigger: Dante stumbles upon an opportunity for a big heist that can change their lives; only problem, he needs $50 for the initial investment. In desperation, he takes $50 from Liam's bike fund expecting to replace it soon.

Step 3 Justification: A trigger or main event sparks the story's complications. Here, Dante's decision sets up the plot's ensuing conflict.

4. Rising Action: Predictably, Dante's plan fails, leaving him with no money to return. Meanwhile, Liam discovers the missing money and becomes suspicious. An immediate quarrel ensues which strains their bond, leaving a void in their relationship.

Step 4 Justification: The rising action develops the story's conflict, heightening the main characters' problems and deepening their struggles.

5. Climax: A local cycle race is announced with a prize of $5000, enough to replace the stolen money and buy the race bike. Dante, feeling guilty, decides to enter the race to win that money, despite having no experience in competitive cycling.

Step 5 Justification: A climax is the turning point of the story and leads it towards a resolution. Here, Dante's decision to compete serves just that purpose. 

6. Falling Action: Dante begins to train rigorously but is undoubtedly the underdog. Liam, though still angry, watches silently from sidelines. Despite numerous setbacks and temptations to quit, Dante perseveres.

Step 6 Justification: Falling action starts resolving the conflicts and tensions of the story, leading to the movieâ€™s conclusion.

7. Resolution: On race day, Dante manages to win by a hair's breadth, earning not only the prize money but also Liam's respect. He returns the stolen $50 and contributes the rest towards Liam's dream bike, mending their strained relationship.

Step 7 Justification: The resolution ties up the story's loose ends, fulfilling character goals in a satisfying (though not always happy) way.

8. Ending Scene: The story closes with Liam participating in the National Cycling Championship with Dante cheering him on, showing the newfound harmony between the brothers.

Step 8 Justification: The ending scene reinforces the resolution and leaves the audience with a final impression, concluding the movie on a hopeful note.
