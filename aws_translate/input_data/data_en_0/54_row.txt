Question: In April, Tank gathered 10 more Easter eggs than Emma in their first round of egg hunt. However, Emma gathered twice as many eggs as Tank in their second round of egg hunt, while Tank's total number of eggs in the second round was 20 less than the number she had gathered in the first round. If the total number of eggs in the pile they were collecting with 6 other people was 400 eggs, and Emma gathered 60 eggs in the second egg hunt round, find the number of eggs that the 6 other egg hunters collected?
Answer: Tank's total number of eggs in the second round was 60 / 2 = 30 since Emma gathered twice as many eggs as Tank in their second round of egg hunt. The total number of eggs that Emma and Tank gathered in the second round was 60 + 30 = 90. Tank's total number of eggs in the second round was 20 less than the number she had gathered in the first round, meaning she had gathered 30 + 20 = 50 eggs in the first round of egg hunt. Tank gathered 10 more Easter eggs than Emma in their first round of egg hunt, meaning Emma collected 50 - 10 = 40 eggs. The total number of eggs Emma and Tank collected in the first round was 40 + 50 = 90. In the two rounds, Emma and Tank gathered 90 + 90 = 180 eggs. If the total number of eggs in the pile they were collecting with 6 other people was 400 eggs, the six other people gathered 400 - 180 = 220 eggs. The answer is 220.

Question: Two runners are competing in a 10-mile race. The first runs at an average pace of 8 minutes per mile, while the second runs at an average pace of 7 minutes per mile. After 56 minutes, the second runner stops for a drink of water. For how many minutes could the second runner remain stopped before the first runner catches up with him?
Answer: After 56 minutes, the second runner has traveled 56 / 7 = 8 miles. Similarly, the first runner has traveled 56 / 8 = 7 miles. Therefore, the two runners are 8 - 7 = 1 mile apart when the second runner stops. Thus, the second runner can stop for a maximum of 8 minutes, which is the amount of time it takes the first runner to travel 1 mile. The answer is 8.

Question: Reese had a sum of money in her savings account. The company she used to work with was not doing well which is why she lost her job. So she spent 20% of her savings for her expenses in February, 40% of it in March, and $1500 in April. How much did she have in her savings account if she still has $2900 after spending those amounts?
Answer: The total percentage of money that Reese spent in February and March is 20% + 40% = 60%. This means the April expenses and the money left in her account make up 100% - 60% = 40% of her savings. Reese had $2900 + $1500 = $4400 for the April expenses and the money left in her account. So, $4400 is equal to 40% which means every 1% is equal to $4400 / 40 = $110. Therefore, Reese originally had $110 x 100 = $11000 in her savings account. The answer is 11000.
