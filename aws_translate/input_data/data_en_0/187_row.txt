Afghan soil, my life takes a drastic turn that I had never anticipated. As soon as we arrive, my then-husband Adul-Kareem's true colors begin to show. He reveals to me that our time in Afghanistan would be far different from what he had initially promised. No longer the progressive Western student, Adul-Kareem embraces his conservative Afghan roots and the patriarchal society, insisting that our wedding celebrations must follow traditional Afghan customs.

During the wedding preparations, I am told that I will be required to wear a burqa, a head-to-toe covering garment that I had never worn in my life. Despite my hesitations and protests, I am told it is expected of me as his newlywed wife. As the celebrations unfold, I find myself questioning my decision to marry Adul-Kareem, as the life I had envisioned for myself seems to be fading away.

In my new life as an Afghan bride, I am taken to Adul-Kareem's family compound where I meet my mother-in-law for the first time. It soon becomes apparent that I will have very little freedom, as my mother-in-law maintains an oppressive control over the household. She expects me to abide by the strict rules and regulations of Afghan society, insisting that I must learn the local language, wear the traditional heavy attire, and adjust to the role of an obedient, subservient wife. My smooth-talking, liberal husband suddenly morphs into an oppressive dictator, expecting me to adhere to these stringent customs.

Over the next five months, I experience immense feelings of isolation, as my world becomes increasingly confined within the walls of my new home. My conversations become limited, as Adul-Kareem discourages me from asking questions or discussing topics that do not align with the conservative beliefs of his family. I spend most of my days with the other women in the harem, who share their own tales of oppression and resilience. We are all prisoners in our own ways, caged by the rigid expectations of Afghan society.

As my health begins to deteriorate from the lack of basic necessities, such as clean water, medicine, and proper nutrition, I become desperate to escape. Life in the harem is unbearable, with no end in sight. I decide that I need to find a way to return to America before it's too late. In a stroke of luck, a sympathetic member of Adul-Kareem's family aids my escape and ensures that I am ushered onto a plane back to the United States.

Upon my return to America, I am met with relief and disbelief from friends and family. After recounting the traumatic details of my time in Afghanistan, I decide to seek an annulment of my marriage to Adul-Kareem. It is a long and painful process, but ultimately successful.

Years later, I write "An American Bride in Kabul" as a testament to my harrowing experience in Afghanistan and as a warning for others who may be navigating cross-cultural relationships. The book serves as a powerful reminder that, while love can temporarily blind us to cultural differences, understanding, mutual respect, and compassion for one another are essential for a healthy and successful union.
