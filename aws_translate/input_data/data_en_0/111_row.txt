In 2016, there were several key technological, social, and political initiatives that various organizations and governments around the world wanted to implement. These initiatives aimed at addressing contemporary challenges and achieving sustainable growth. Some of the notable implementations in 2016 include:

1. The Paris Agreement: In April 2016, the Paris Agreement on climate change was opened for signature, following its adoption in December 2015. This landmark agreement sought to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspirational goal of limiting the increase to 1.5°C. It received widespread international support and marked a significant step forward in global efforts to combat climate change.

2. The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): In 2016, the UN SDGs officially came into effect, replacing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as the new global framework for development. The 17 SDGs aim to address a wide range of social, environmental, and economic challenges, such as poverty, inequality, climate change, and peace and justice, by 2030.

3. The United States Presidential Election: The 2016 U.S. presidential election saw the implementation of various new political strategies, technologies, and communication platforms. Both major candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, leveraged social media, data analytics, and other innovations to reach and engage with their supporters, as well as to shape public opinion.

4. The World Health Organization's (WHO) "End TB Strategy": In 2016, the WHO continued to implement its ambitious "End TB Strategy," which was launched in 2014. The strategy aims to reduce tuberculosis deaths by 95% and to cut new cases by 90% between 2015 and 2035, among other goals.

5. Expansion of Renewable Energy: Governments and private organizations around the world increased their efforts to implement renewable energy solutions in 2016. This included making significant investments in solar, wind, and other clean energy technologies to reduce dependency on fossil fuels and combat climate change.

6. Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics: In 2016, numerous tech companies, research institutions, and governments announced ambitious plans to invest in and implement AI and robotics technologies. This included initiatives to improve education, healthcare, transportation, and other sectors, as well as addressing ethical and legal concerns related to AI.

7. Implementation of the European Union's (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): In 2016, EU institutions worked on implementing the GDPR, a significant overhaul of data protection legislation that would come into effect in May 2018. The regulation aimed to harmonize data protection laws across the EU and strengthen the rights of individuals concerning their personal data.

These are just a few examples of the many varied initiatives that were sought to be implemented in 2016 across the world, addressing different challenges and aiming for growth and improvement across multiple sectors.
