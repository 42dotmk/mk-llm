"Classroom".

There are several reasons why a child's work would be on the wall in a classroom. To start, classrooms are typically the primary locations where children engage in learning activities, including various forms of artwork. The classroom serves as a foundational platform for students to express their creativity and illustrate their understanding of different subjects.

When children create artwork or complete assignments in class, teachers often display the best or most noteworthy pieces on the classroom walls. This practice serves multiple purposes. For one, it recognizes and applauds students' efforts, which can help boost their self-esteem and motivation. Kids feel proud when they see their work on display, and it gives them a sense of accomplishment. 

Having children's work on the classroom walls also creates a conducive learning environment. It personalizes the space, making it feel more comfortable and welcoming to the students. The display of colorful artwork and engaging projects can be visually stimulating for children, promoting their creativity and helping to make the classroom an inspiring place for learning.

Additionally, displaying children's work on the classroom walls is an effective teaching strategy. It provides visual cues that can support students' learning as they can refer to these pieces of work during lessons. For example, a teacher might display a chart with sentence structures, or art pieces related to a particular course subject. Seeing peer work can also motivate other students to try harder, as a form of positive competition.

Furthermore, children's work on classroom walls also serves as an assessment tool. Through observing student work, teachers can gauge a child's progress over the academic year, determine the effectiveness of teaching methods, and identify areas of improvement or where further support is needed.

By comparison, the other options listed in the question don't usually serve as a place where a child's work would be displayed. A labyrinth is a complex network of pathways or passages, typically seen in puzzle games or certain architecture designs—not a common place to display child’s work. China, while a valid geographical location, is too broad and not specific enough to be considered an appropriate context for the display of child's work. A corner is merely a sectional space, not specific enough to reliably present a child’s creation. 

An "art show" could potentially display a child's work, but this implies a formal event or exhibit that showcases art pieces usually from a collection of artists. While a student's artwork could indeed make its way into an art show - particularly if it's a school-hosted event or a competition - this is a less common and routine occurrence compared to the continual display of children's work in a classroom setting.

Hence, as per the context of the question, the most suitable answer would certainly be "classroom". It is in classrooms where children's work is typically displayed proudly on the walls, serving a multitude of educational and motivational purposes in their learning journey.
