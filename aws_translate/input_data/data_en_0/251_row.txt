Question: Carly is making a beaded corset. She's going to add 50 rows of purple beads with 20 beads per row, 40 rows of blue beads with 18 beads per row, and 80 gold beads. If beads cost $1 per 10 beads, how much do all the beads she bought cost?
Answer: First find the total number of purple beads Carly needs: 50 rows * 20 beads / row = 1000 beads. Then find the total number of blue beads Carly needs: 40 rows * 18 beads / row = 720 beads. Then add the number of each color she needs to find the total number she needs: 1000 beads + 720 beads + 80 beads = 1800 beads. Then divide the number of beads by 10 to find the cost: 1800 beads / 10 beads / $1 = $180. The answer is 180.
[Question]Leonard and his brother Michael bought presents for their father. Leonard bought a wallet at $50 and two pairs of sneakers at $100 each pair, while Michael bought a backpack at $100 and two pairs of jeans at $50 each pair. How much did they spend in all?
[Answer]Two pairs of sneakers cost 2 x $100 = $200. So, Leonard spent $50 + $200 = $250. Two pairs of jeans cost 2 x $50 = $100. Thus, Michael spent $100 + $100 = $200. Therefore, they spent a total of $250 + $200 = $450 in all. The answer is 450.

Question: At Roosevelt high school there are 600 students in the senior class. A fifth of the students are in the marching band. Of the students in the marching band, half of them play a brass instrument. Of the students that play a brass instrument, a fifth of them play the saxophone. Of the students that play the saxophone, a third of them play the alto saxophone. How many students play the alto saxophone?
Answer: The number of students in the marching band is 600 / 5 = 120 students. The number of students that play a brass instrument is 120 / 2 = 60 students. The number of students that play the saxophone is 60 / 5 = 12 students. The number of students that play the alto saxophone is 12 / 3 = 4 students. The answer is 4.
[Question]A soccer team has three goalies and ten defenders. The team also has twice as many midfielders as defenders, and the rest of the players are strikers. If the team has 40 players, how many strikers are in the team?
[Answer]The team's total number of goalies and defenders is 3 + 10 = 13. The number of midfielders in the team is twice the number of defenders, which means there are 2 * 10 = 20 defenders in the team. The total number of players in the team playing the positions of goalies, defenders and midfielders is 20 + 13 = 33. If there are 40 players in the team, then the number of strikes in the team is 40 - 33 = 7. The answer is 7.
