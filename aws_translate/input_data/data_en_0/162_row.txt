Q: Janet is trying to decide whether to quit her job and start freelancing. She works 40 hours a week at both jobs. She get paid $30/hour at her current job, and would get paid $40/hour as a freelancer. However, she'd have to pay an extra $25 a week in FICA taxes plus $400/month in healthcare premiums. How much more would Janet make per month as a freelancer if there are four weeks in a month?
A: First find the difference in hourly wages: $40 / hour - $30 / hour = $10 / hour. Then multiply that difference by the number of hours she works in a week to find the weekly difference: $10 / hour * 40 hours / week = $400 / week. Then multiply that amount by the number of weeks in a month to find the monthly difference in her earnings: $400 / week * 4 weeks / month = $1600 / month. Then find the total additional amount Janet pays in FICA taxes: $25 / week * 4 weeks / month = $100 / month. Then subtract Janet's extra FICA taxes and healthcare premium from the additional money she earns to find the net increase in her pay from freelancing: $1600 / month - $400 / month - $100 / month = $1100 / month. The answer is 1100.

Answer: If Ed has 2 dogs and 3 cats he has in total 2 + 3 = 5 pets that are not fish. If Ed has twice as many cats and dogs combined he has 2 * 5 = 10 fish. Therefore, in total Ed has 5 + 10 = 15 pets. The answer is 15.
[Question]Mark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?
[Answer]There are 80 / 100 * 10 = 8 more purple flowers than yellow flowers. So in Mark's garden, there are 10 + 8 = 18 purple flowers. Purple and yellow flowers sum up to 10 + 18 = 28 flowers. That means in Mark's garden there are 25 / 100 * 28 = 7 green flowers. So in total Mark has 28 + 7 = 35 plants in his garden. The answer is 35.
