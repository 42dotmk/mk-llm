Title: Deadline 5 A.M. 

Plot: 

The movie starts in the bustling city of New York where our protagonist, Jake Donovan - a genius, yet somewhat carefree, coder working in a booming tech startup, is busy writing code lines for their really ambitious AR (Augmented Reality) project. Jake's life is casual, involving coding during the day, frequent banter with his colleagues, countless cups of coffee, and occasional card games in the evening at their favorite hangout place. 

One day, Jake's company is tasked by renowned and wealthy tech entrepreneur, Maxwell Sinclair, with a highly secretive project - The Final Table. The project stirs up interest within the tech community due to Sinclair's cryptic remarks about how it will change the world. Jake's team is chosen for the project, with a shattering deadline just 11 days away at 5 A.M. 

The plot thickens as Jake and his team dive headfirst into the project. Each day, they encounter hurdles and experience moments of breakthrough. The movie encapsulates these chaotic days and sleepless nights fabulously while also building up each character, their motivations, and internal dynamics. Throughout this, Jake becomes particularly engrossed in the complexity of The Final Table.

Despite initial delays and disagreements, they all push their limits to meet the deadline, only to discover that The Final Table is much more than a tech project. It's a doomsday device capable of inducing realistic mass hallucinations through AR, effectively capable of controlling the entire human population. Sinclair's corporative image is just a fa√ßade to his nefarious plan of global dominance.

The team is shocked and utterly torn between their morally correct path and their professional obligation towards the project. The climax builds up as Jake decides not to let Sinclair implement his dystopian plan. 

While simultaneously working on the project, Jake and his associates stealthily work on an antithesis to the device. With the deadline approaching, tension grows as both Sinclair and Jake race against time - one to take over the world, and one to save it, all leading up to the unforgettable 5 A.M.

As the deadline arrives, Sinclair, who has been monitoring the team's progress, is ready to activate The Final Table. But right as he is about to start it, Jake and his team activate the antithesis device, which hijacks Sinclair's system and sends it into a destructive loop. 

Just when Sinclair realizes what transpires, it's too late. The Final Table crashes and falls apart even before it starts. Sinclair is arrested as the evidence against his malicious intent surfaces, and Jake and his team are hailed as unsung heroes.

The film culminates in an emotional climax as Jake submits the project report of The Final Table to his boss with, ironically, the remark "Project Completed". The movie ends there, leaving audiences with a feeling of closure and a lingering thought about the misuse of technology in wrong hands. 

Deadline 5 A.M. would be a nail-biting techno-thriller with underlying themes of teamwork, courage, and the ethical use of technology.
