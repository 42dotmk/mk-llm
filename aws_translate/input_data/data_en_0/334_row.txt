Reasoning and answer: First convert the total length of the journey from kilometers to meters: 9 kilometers * 1000 meters / kilometer = 9000 meters. Then divide this by the length of one step to find the number of steps in the journey: 9000 meters / 3 meters / step = 3000 steps. Then multiply the number of steps by the number of flowers per step to find how many flowers one unicorn creates on the journey: 3000 steps * 4 flowers / step = 12000 flowers. Then multiply the number of flowers per unicorn by the number of unicorns to find the total number of flowers created: 12000 flowers / unicorn * 6 unicorns = 72,000 flowers.
The answer: 72000

They have $126 for helium because 200 - 42 - 18 - 14 = 126. They can buy 84 ounces of helium because 126 / 1.5 = 84. They can fly 9,492 feet up because 84 x 113 = 9,492.
The answer: 9492
Reverse engineering the question: Harry wants to build a homemade helium balloon with his son, Kevin, so he and Kevin go to the store with $200.
