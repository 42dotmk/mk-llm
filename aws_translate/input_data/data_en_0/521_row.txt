The two questions you asked are different. The first question seeks examples of really good copywriting, while the second question requests examples of bad copywriting. I will provide examples and reasons for each of them.

Good copywriting examples:

1. Apple - "Think Different" campaign: This iconic campaign showcased Apple's mission to challenge the status quo and empower visionaries. The minimalist design and simple yet powerful message differentiated Apple from competitors and created a lasting impression on consumers.

2. Volkswagen - "Think Small" campaign: This 1960s campaign revolutionized automobile advertising by emphasizing efficiency and small size, setting Volkswagen's Beetle apart from the bigger, gas-guzzling cars on the market. The copy was direct, engaging, and conversational, turning the car's perceived weaknesses into strengths.

3. Nike - "Just Do It": The slogan "Just Do It" is concise, to the point, and easily memorable. It communicates Nike's focus on empowerment and taking action, directly resonating with customers who want to push their limits.

4. Dollar Shave Club - "Our Blades Are F***ing Great" video ad: This humorous and irreverent ad quickly became a viral sensation due to its clever storytelling and entertaining style. The script is clear and effectively conveys the benefits of the subscription service while positioning Dollar Shave Club as a cool and unpretentious brand.

Bad copywriting examples:

1. Krystal Restaurants - "As long as the food tastes good, who cares what's in it?": This ill-advised slogan inadvertently highlighted people's concerns about unhealthy ingredients in fast food, raising questions about Krystal's commitment to quality.

2. Coors Light - "Turn it loose!": This poorly translated slogan for the Spanish market caused confusion as it had a double meaning: while it meant to say “Set it free,” it also translated to “Get Diarrhea.” It is an example of what happens when cultural and linguistic nuances are not carefully considered.

3. Pepsi - "Pepsi brings you back to life": In China, the original slogan "Come alive with Pepsi" was mistranslated, and its actual meaning became "Pepsi brings your ancestors back from the grave." This led to a significant cultural mishap and hurt the brand's image in China.

4. Electrolux - "Nothing sucks like Electrolux": Designed for an American audience, this British-based vacuum cleaner company's slogan had unintended negative connotations because "sucks" is slang for "bad" or "poor quality" in the United States. As a result, the slogan backfired in the American market.

To sum up, the two questions you asked were different, focusing on examples of good and bad copywriting. Good copywriting examples include Apple's "Think Different," Volkswagen's "Think Small," Nike's "Just Do It," and Dollar Shave Club's "Our Blades Are F***ing Great" video ad. In contrast, bad copywriting examples are Krystal Restaurants' "As long as the food tastes good, who cares what's in it?", Coors Light's "Turn it loose!", Pepsi's "Pepsi brings you back to life," and Electrolux's "Nothing sucks like Electrolux."
