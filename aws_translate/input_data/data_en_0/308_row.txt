Reverse engineering the question: Hally and her friends organized a high school reunion. To cover the cost of a late-night party that they planned for at the reunion, each attendee had to pay $100.

Reasoning and answer: The number of red flowers is twice as many as orange so 2 * 10 orange = 20 red flowers. The number of yellow flowers is 5 less than red so 20 red - 5 = 15 yellow flowers. The number of red, orange and yellow flowers is 20 red + 10 orange + 15 yellow = 45 flowers. The number of pink and purple flowers total is 105 flowers total - 45 flowers that are not pink or purple = 60 flowers. The number of pink and purple flowers each is 60 flowers / 2 = 30 flowers each.
The answer: 30

Question: A garden is filled with 105 flowers of various colors. There are twice as many red flowers as orange. There are five fewer yellow flowers than red. If there are 10 orange flowers, how many pink and purple flowers are there if they have the same amount and there are no other colors?

Eustace’s current age must be 39 years old – 3 years = 36 years old. So Milford’s current age must be 36 years old / 2 = 18 years old. So in 3 years, Milford will be 18 years old + 3 years = 21 years old.
The answer: 21
Reverse engineering the question: Eustace is twice as old as Milford. In 3 years, he will be 39. How old will Milford be?

Reasoning and answer: The sum of black and white shirts is 63 + 42 = 105. The number of jeans in the store is (2 / 3) x 105 = 70. The sum of ties and belts is 34 + 40 = 74. The number of scarfs in the store is 74 / 2 = 37. There are 70 - 37 = 33 more jeans than scarfs in the store.
The answer: 33
