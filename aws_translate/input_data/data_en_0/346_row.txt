Q: Facebook decided to award a productivity bonus to all its female employees who are mothers. This productivity bonus will total 25% of Facebook's annual earnings, which was $5,000,000 for the year 2020. It is known that Facebook employs 3300 employees; one-third are men, and of the women, 1200 are not mothers. How much was the bonus that each female mother employee received, assuming each one received an equal amount?
A: 25% of Facebook's annual earnings is 25 / 100 * $5,000,000 = $1,250,000. The number of male employees is 3300 * 1 / 3 = 1100. So, the number of female employees is 3300 - 1100 = 2200. The number of female employees who are not moms is 2200 - 1200 = 1000. So the amount to be distributed to each mother would be $1,250,000 / 1000 = $1250. The answer is 1250.
Question: Ted needs to purchase 5 bananas and 10 oranges. If bananas cost $2 each and oranges cost $1.50 each. How much money does Ted need to purchase 5 bananas and 10 oranges?
Answer: Ted needs 5 bananas and they each cost $2. To purchase the bananas, Ted needs 5 * 2 = 10 dollars. Because Ted needs 10 oranges and they each cost $1.50, Ted needs 10 * 1.5 = 15 dollars to pay for the oranges. All together Ted needs $10 for the bananas and $15 for the oranges, so combined Ted needs 10 + 15 = 25 dollars to purchase all the produce. The answer is 25.

Question: Benjamin is tracking how many miles he walks in a week. He walks to work and home five days a week, walks his dog twice a day every day, walks to his best friend’s house once a week, and walks to the convenience store twice a week. Work is six miles away, dog walks are two miles, his best friend’s house is one mile, and the convenience store is three miles. How many miles does Benjamin walk in a week?
Answer: Benjamin walks 6 miles to work and 6 miles home, so he walks 6 * 2 = 12 miles to work and home. He walks to work 5 days a week, so he walks 12 * 5 = 60 miles to work and home a week. He walks his dog 2 times a day for 2 miles, so he walks 2 * 2 = 4 miles a day for his dog. He walks his dog 7 days a week, so he walks 4 * 7 = 28 miles for his dog. He walks 3 miles to the store 2 times a week, so he walks 2 * 3 = 6 miles to the store each week. Adding his weekly 1 mile to his friend’s house, Benjamin walks 60 + 28 + 6 + 1 = 95 miles in a week. The answer is 95.
