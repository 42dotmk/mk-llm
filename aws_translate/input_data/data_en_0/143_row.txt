No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information, but they are related in a way that they deal with the perception and understanding of historical and present relations between Pakistan and India, which are two neighboring countries in South Asia.

1. Do all Pakistani people hate India?

It would be incorrect and unfair to generalize that all Pakistani people hate India, as people's views and opinions on India would vary significantly based on their upbringing, personal experiences, knowledge of history, and political views. Both countries have had periods of conflict and shared historical experiences that may have contributed to negative sentiment among some people in both countries. However, it is important to remember that individual opinions cannot be generalized to the entire population of a nation.

There are many Pakistani citizens who have maintained friendly relationships with their Indian counterparts. Some individuals from both countries have strong ties in the form of friends, families, and business associates across the border. The cultural and linguistic similarities between the two nations also contribute to shared experiences and mutual appreciation.

Additionally, with the rise of social media and improved access to global communication, an increasing number of Indian and Pakistani youngsters are engaging in various dialogues and platforms to promote peace and understanding between the two countries.

2. I heard many Pakistani people saying that India did not exist before 1947. Is it true?

The statement that "India did not exist before 1947" is not entirely true but can be contextualized to understand its meaning more accurately. The modern-day nations of India and Pakistan were created in 1947 as a result of the partition of British India, which led to the creation of two separate, independent nations primarily based on religious differences, India being predominantly Hindu and Pakistan being predominantly Muslim.

India as a geographical region, consisting of cities, culture, and historical empires, has existed for thousands of years before 1947. The Indian subcontinent has a rich history, encompassing various cultures, religions, and empires. Historically, the region has been ruled by several empires and dynasties, like the Maurya, Gupta, Mughal, and British Empires.

However, the political map of the region changed after the end of British colonial rule in 1947. It is this political map of India, consisting of its current borders, that one might argue did not exist before 1947. It is essential to differentiate between the geographical and historical existence of India and the modern political entity created after the partition.

In conclusion, while there might be a variety of opinions and interpretations related to the history and the relationship between India and Pakistan, it is crucial to consider the diverse range of perspectives and individual experiences. It is also important to recognize the shared history, culture, and opportunities for collaboration and peace between the people of the two countries.
