If the premise "beaches tend to be smaller, in bays rather than in long stretches of shoreline" is true, it is important to analyze how this information might relate to the hypothesis "the small beaches still draw crowds of tourists every year." While the premise provides information about the physical attributes of beaches, it does not directly support or contradict the hypothesis about their popularity with tourists. However, we can discuss the potential implications and connections between the premise and hypothesis.

First, let's consider the characteristics of smaller beaches in bays. These beaches, due to their location within bays, might possess several attributes that could be attractive to tourists. Bays generally provide a sheltered and calmer environment compared to open stretches of shoreline, which might result in more gentle and predictable waves, which in turn could make swimming and sunbathing more enjoyable for visitors. Additionally, bays often have warmer waters, a higher concentration of marine life, and more opportunities for water-based recreational activities like snorkeling, kayaking, or paddleboarding.

Now, let's examine the potential impact of these attributes on the tourism industry. Tourists, in general, are drawn to aesthetically pleasing, comfortable, and activity-filled environments. Smaller beaches in bays, as discussed above, might offer such conditions, which could indeed attract crowds of tourists. Additionally, small beaches might provide a more intimate, exclusive, and less crowded experience compared to large, open stretches of shoreline, which some tourists might find appealing.

However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the hypothesis solely focuses on the popularity of small beaches among tourists and does not provide any information on their popularity relative to more extensive beaches. Being popular or drawing crowds does not imply that these beaches are visited on the same scale as larger, more prominent beaches found along open stretches of coastline.

Furthermore, the premise does not take into account factors beyond physical attributes that might influence the popularity of beaches among tourists. Factors such as accessibility, availability of accommodation and amenities, promotional activities by local tourism authorities, and word-of-mouth testimonials might significantly impact whether small beaches in bays see high levels of visitation or not.

In conclusion, while the premise that "beaches tend to be smaller, in bays rather than in long stretches of shoreline" provides useful insight into their physical characteristics, it does not directly support or contradict the hypothesis "the small beaches still draw crowds of tourists every year." Nevertheless, the attributes of smaller beaches in bays could make them appealing to tourists, potentially resulting in considerable visitation. However, various factors outside the premise's scope might influence the popularity of these beaches, and therefore, a direct correlation between beach size and tourist attraction cannot be established without additional data and information.
