The United Nations serves as a key platform for the establishment of international treaties, which are critical for fostering cooperation, diplomacy, and the observance of international law among Member States. After a treaty's adoption, there are three primary official legal procedures that must be followed, as managed by the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs. These legal procedures ensure the proper functioning and implementation of the treaty among the participating countries.

1. Signature:
The first official procedure is the signature of the treaty by the respective Member States. The signature marks an initial step in which parties express their intention to comply with the treaty's terms and conditions. Each state typically authorizes a specific representative, often their ambassador or respective foreign minister, to sign the treaty on behalf of their nation. A signing ceremony is usually organized during which the representatives from participating countries gather and sign the treaty. The act of signing indicates their country's political commitment to adhering to the treaty's principles and abiding by its provisions in good faith. However, signing does not necessarily make the treaty legally binding yet.

2. Ratification:
After the signing ceremony, the ratification process takes place to establish the treaty as legally binding for each state party. Ratification is the act by which each nation's government gives its formal consent to be bound by the treaty, typically after having obtained the approval of its parliament or the appropriate legislative authority. The ratification demonstrates that the countries involved have the intention to uphold the treaty's provisions in both domestic and international law. Each nation follows its specific constitutional guidelines to ratify the treaty, which may involve the passage of domestic legislation or the approval by certain governmental bodies. Once completed, the ratification instruments are deposited with the United Nations Secretary-General or another designated depositary. 

3. Entry into Force:
The final legal procedure for a treaty is the entry into force, which is when the treaty officially becomes legally binding for the participating countries. The requirements for a treaty to enter into force are usually specified in the treaty text itself, often in the form of a specific number of ratifications or a specified date upon which the treaty's provisions become effective. Entry into force means that the treaty principles and obligations are now integrated into the international legal system and are binding on the state parties. From this point on, these states are expected to comply with and fulfill their duties under the treaty in accordance with international law.

In summary, the three primary official legal procedures of the United Nations that all treaties must follow after their adoption are the signature, ratification, and entry into force. These procedures are essential in ensuring the legitimacy, legal binding nature, and effective implementation of a treaty among the Member States.
