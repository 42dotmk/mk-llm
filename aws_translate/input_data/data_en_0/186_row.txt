The last state to be added to the United States was Hawaii, which officially became the 50th state on August 21, 1959. Situated in the Pacific Ocean, Hawaii is an archipelago of eight major islands along with several smaller islands and atolls. The major islands are Hawai'i (also known as the Big Island), Maui, Oahu, Kauai, Molokai, Lanai, Niihau, and Kahoolawe.

Hawaii's path to statehood was a long and complex one. Before the arrival of Europeans, Hawaii was an independent Polynesian kingdom with a rich history and culture. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, European explorers and traders, led by British Captain James Cook, visited the islands and established contact with the native Hawaiians. Their arrival brought diseases that the native Hawaiian population had no immunity to, ultimately leading to a significant decline in their numbers.

Throughout the 19th century, Hawaii experienced a period of rapid economic and societal transformation, with American missionaries and immigrant laborers, particularly from Asia, arriving in large numbers. The influence of these newcomers began to permeate Hawaiian society, impacting everything from politics and economics to religion and education.

In 1893, the last reigning monarch of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Queen Lili ªuokalani, was overthrown by a group of American and European businessmen in a coup. A provisional government was established, which was later replaced by the Republic of Hawaii in 1894. The United States annexed the islands during the Spanish-American War in 1898, and Hawaii became a US territory in 1900.

As a US territory, Hawaii developed a thriving economy based on agriculture (particularly pineapple and sugarcane), tourism, and military installations. However, the territory's population was diverse, and not all residents were in favor of statehood. Many native Hawaiian groups, as well as some immigrant laborers, felt that the United States had illegitimately taken control of their islands.

Despite these concerns, calls for statehood grew louder after World War II, which had seen a massive influx of military personnel and investment into the region. Hawaii's strategic location in the Pacific Ocean made it essential for US defense interests, and this, combined with the islands' burgeoning tourism industry, prompted Congress to consider admitting Hawaii as a state.

Following several years of debate and deliberation, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Hawaii Admission Act into law on March 18, 1959. This act provided for Hawaii's transition from a territory to a state, pending the approval of the people of Hawaii. A plebiscite was held in June 1959, in which over 94% of the voters supported statehood, and Hawaii officially joined the union as the 50th state on August 21, 1959.

Hawaii's unique history, rich cultural heritage, and natural beauty have made it a distinctive and valuable addition to the United States. Today, the state plays a vital role in US defense, as well as being a major tourism destination, and it continues to be a melting pot of diverse cultures and traditions.
