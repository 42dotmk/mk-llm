[Question]Leo's assignment was divided into three parts. He finished the first part of his assignment in 25 minutes. It took him twice as long to finish the second part. If he was able to finish his assignment in 2 hours, how many minutes did Leo finish the third part of the assignment?
[Answer]It took Leo 25 x 2 = 50 minutes to finish the second part of the assignment. Leo finished the first and second parts of the assignment in 25 + 50 = 75 minutes. He finished the entire assignment in 60 x 2 = 120 minutes. Therefore, it took Leo 120 - 75 = 45 minutes to finish the third part of the assignment. The answer is 45.
Q: Scott wants to make and freeze a large batch of ratatouille. At the farmers' market he buys 5 pounds of eggplants and 4 pounds of zucchini at $2.00 a pound. He needs 4 pounds of tomatoes that are $3.50 a pound. The onions are $1.00 a pound and he needs 3 pounds. Then he needs a pound of basil which is sold for $2.50 per half pound. If this yields 4 quarts, how much does each quart cost?
A: He buys 5 pounds of eggplants and 4 pounds of zucchini so he buys 5 + 4 = 9 pounds of produce. These 9 pounds are $2.00 a pound for a total of 9 * 2 = $18.00. He needs 4 pounds of tomatoes that are $3.50 a pound for a total of 4 * 3.50 = $14.00. He needs 3 pounds of onions that are $1.00 a pound so that's 3 * 1 = $3.00. The basil is sold by the half - pound and he needs a full pound so that's 2.50 * 2 = $5.00. The eggplants and zucchinis cost $18.00, the tomatoes are $14.00, the onions are $3.00 and the basil is $5.00 for a total of 18 + 14 + 3 + 5 = $40.00. This recipe makes 4 quarts and the total price of the vegetables was $40.00 so each quart costs 40 / 4 = $10.00. The answer is 10.

[Question]Every year, Mabel gets as many quarters as she is years old. She always puts these and nothing else in a piggy bank. When she turns 7, how much money is in the bank?
[Answer]On her second birthday she adds $.5 because 2 x .25 = .5. On her third birthday she adds $.35 because 3 x .25 = .75. On her fourth birthday she adds $1 because 4 x .25 = 1. On her fifth birthday she adds $1.25 because 5 x .25 = 1.25. On her six birthday she adds $1.5 because 6 x .25 = 1.5. On her seventh birthday she adds $1.75 because 7 x .25 = 1.75. The total is $7 because .25 + .5 + .75 + 1 + 1.25 + 1.5 + 1.75 = 7. The answer is 7.
