Step 1: Identify the core theme of the movie - The first movie ever and 'The Blob'

In order to create a compelling movie plot, we need to ensure that the story is built around the core theme, which in this case is the first movie ever made and its connection to 'The Blob'. Therefore, our storyline should revolve around the idea of discovering the origins of cinema and how 'The Blob' played a crucial role in that.

Step 2: Establish main characters

For our plot, we will need a set of main characters:

1. A history professor (Dr. James) who is passionate about the origins of cinema
2. His brilliant but rebellious student (Emma) who helps him explore the history
3. A mysterious collector (Mr. Wilson) who possesses rare film artifacts and objects

Step 3: Develop the initial conflict and motivation

Dr. James is a well-respected history professor who has dedicated his life to uncovering the origins of cinema. He believes that 'The Blob' was the first-ever movie, contrary to popular belief. Emma, an enthusiastic student of his, shares his passion and joins him in trying to prove this theory.

Step 4: Create the inciting incident

Dr. James and Emma come across a newspaper article, dated back to 1895, which mentions the discovery of a lost film reel that supposedly contains the footage of 'The Blob'. They find out that the reel is now in the possession of the reclusive collector, Mr. Wilson. Motivated by this information, they embark on a quest to find Mr. Wilson and acquire the film reel.

Step 5: Introduce the main challenges, hurdles, and obstacles

Dr. James and Emma will face numerous challenges in their quest:

1. Convincing the enigmatic Mr. Wilson to show them the film reel and share his knowledge
2. Decoding the secretive language used in notes and letters related to the lost film reel
3. Evading a rival historian who is determined to discredit Dr. James and his theory

Step 6: Present the climax

In the climax of the movie, Dr. James, Emma, and Mr. Wilson manage to assemble a group of various film artifacts, including the lost film reel, inside a makeshift theater. They meticulously set up an antique film projector and play 'The Blob' for the first time in over a century.

As they watch the film unfold, they discover a hidden message encrypted within the reel, proving that 'The Blob' is indeed the first-ever movie, and subsequently, they reveal this exceptional discovery to the world.

Step 7: Conclude the movie with a resolution

Having achieved their goal, Dr. James' theory is finally acknowledged as a ground-breaking revelation in the world of cinema history. He earns the recognition and respect he deserves. Emma, on the other hand, has grown immensely from this experience and decides to pursue a career in film history. Mr. Wilson, moved by their passion, decides to share his vast collection of film artifacts with the world, opening up a new era of film preservation and appreciation.

And so, 'The Blob' becomes widely known as the first-ever movie, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the origins of cinema for future generations.
