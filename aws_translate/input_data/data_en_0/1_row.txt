No, the statement you found on Google does not directly answer the question about what Phylum Cnidaria is. Instead, it talks about the rarity of fossils of certain types of cnidarians. Allow me to provide a comprehensive answer to your question.

Phylum Cnidaria is a group of aquatic, mostly marine invertebrate animals that belongs to the kingdom Animalia. This phylum includes over 10,000 diverse species such as jellyfish, sea anemones, corals, and hydras. The name "Cnidaria" is derived from the Greek word "cnidos," which means "stinging nettle." This is due to the presence of specialized cells called cnidocytes or cnidae, which contain specialized organelles called nematocysts. Nematocysts are used by these animals for capturing prey, defense, and sometimes locomotion.

Cnidarians exhibit radial symmetry, meaning their body parts are arranged symmetrically around a central axis. This distinguishes them from bilateral animals like vertebrates and most other invertebrates. They also have a simple body plan that consists of two main cell layers, the outer epidermis and the inner gastrodermis, with a gelatinous mesoglea sandwiched in between. The absence of complex organs is another defining characteristic of this phylum.

Cnidarians can be either sessile (attached to a surface and non-moving) or free-floating, and their life cycle consists of two main forms: the polyp stage and the medusa stage. The polyp stage is sessile and usually reproduces asexually through budding, while the medusa stage is free-floating and typically reproduces sexually. In some cnidarians, like corals, the medusa stage may be absent entirely.

Phylum Cnidaria can be further classified into four main classes:

1. Class Anthozoa: This class includes sea anemones and corals. These animals are exclusively polyps and generally do not have a medusa stage. They have a relatively large size variation and can be solitary or colonial.

2. Class Scyphozoa: This class comprises the "true" jellyfish. They have a dominant medusa stage with a reduced polyp stage. Most members of this class have a bell or umbrella-shaped body with long tentacles.

3. Class Hydrozoa: This class contains hydras, fire corals, and other related species. They exhibit a both polyp and medusa stages, but the medusa stage is often reduced or absent. Some hydrozoans, like hydras, are exclusively freshwater species.

4. Class Cubozoa: This class includes the dangerous box jellies or sea wasps. They have a box-shaped medusa with highly complex eyes and tentacles that contain potent venomous nematocysts.

In conclusion, Phylum Cnidaria is a diverse group of aquatic invertebrate animals, primarily marine, characterized by radial symmetry, a simple body plan, and the presence of specialized stinging cells called cnidocytes. It includes a wide variety of species such as jellyfish, sea anemones, corals, and hydras, and can be further divided into four main classes: Anthozoa, Scyphozoa, Hydrozoa, and Cubozoa. The answer you found on Google is related but does not accurately describe the key features of Phylum Cnidaria.
