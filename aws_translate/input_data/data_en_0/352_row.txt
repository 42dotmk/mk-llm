[Question]Georgina owns a parrot and is teaching it to speak. So far, the parrot knows seventeen phrases. If she is teaching it two phrases a week and it already knew three phrases when she bought it, how many days has Georgina had it?
[Answer]The parrot knew 3 phrases when Georgina bought it, so it has learned 17 - 3 = 14 phrases from her. She has been teaching it 2 phrases a week, so she has had it 14 / 2 = 7 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so Georgina has had the parrot for 7 * 7 = 49 days. The answer is 49.
Q: The total number of books on four shelves, with 400 books each, is the same as the distance in miles that Karen bikes back to her home from the library. Calculate the total distance that Karen covers if she bikes from her home to the library and back.
A: If each shelf has 400 books, then the four shelves have 4 * 400 = 1600 books. Since the total number of books on the shelves is the same as the distance that Karen bikes back home, biking to and from the library takes 1600 + 1600 = 3200 miles. The answer is 3200.
Question: Erica lives near a lake where most locals sell fish as their main source of income, earning $20 per kg of fish. She goes out fishing today and catches twice as many fish as she caught in total in the past four months. If Erica trawled 80 kg of fish in the past four months, not including today, how much money will she have earned in the past four months including today (assuming she sells all her fish)?
Answer: In the past four months, not including today, Erica has 80 kg * $20 / kg = $1600 worth of fish. Today, Erica trawled 80 * 2 = 160 kg of fish. Thus today's earnings are 160 kg * $20 / kg = $3200. Her total earnings are $3200 + $1600 = $4800. The answer is 4800.
[Question]Carla is dividing up insurance claims among 3 agents. Missy can handle 15 more claims than John, who can handle 30% more claims than Jan. If Jan can handle 20 claims, how many claims can Missy handle?
[Answer]First find the additional number of claims John can handle: 30% * 20 claims = 6 claims. Then add that amount to Jan's number of claims to find John's number of claims: 20 claims + 6 claims = 26 claims. Then add the 15 additional claims Missy can handle to find her number: 26 claims + 15 claims = 41 claims. The answer is 41.
Q: For a class fundraiser, 30 students were asked to bring in 12 brownies each. 20 students were asked to bring in 24 cookies each and 15 students were asked to bring in 12 donuts each. If they sell everything for $2.00 each, how much money will they raise?
A: 30 students were asked to bring in 12 brownies so they will bring in 30 * 12 = 360 brownies. 20 students were asked to bring in 24 cookies each so that’s 20 * 24 = 480 cookies. 15 students were asked to bring in 12 donuts each so that’s 15 * 12 = 180 donuts. Together, they have 360 + 480 + 180 = 1,020 treats. If they sell all the treats for $2.00 each then they will make 1020 * 2 = $2,040.00. The answer is 2040.
