(a). No

Although the two questions may seem similar, they have differences in terms of focus and the conflicts they ask to compare.

The first question specifically asks about the major contributions of political leaders during World War 1 (WW1) and how they compare to the ones during the Seven Years' War. To answer this question, we need to discuss the contributions of political leaders in both conflicts and compare them.

Major Contributions during WW1:

1. Woodrow Wilson (US President) - His role was crucial in shaping the post-WW1 world and establishing the League of Nations. He outlined his famous Fourteen Points, which became the blueprint for the Treaty of Versailles.

2. David Lloyd George (British Prime Minister) - A skilful negotiator, George was instrumental in forging the alliance between Britain, France, and the United States. He played a key role in  shaping terms of the Treaty of Versailles and securing British interests after the war.

3. Georges Clemenceau (French Prime Minister) - As the leader of France, Clemenceau ensured that the nation remained committed to a total victory against Germany. He was instrumental in shaping the Treaty of Versailles, focusing on ensuring the security for France in the post-war world.

4. Kaiser Wilhelm II (German Emperor) - He played a major role in the inception and escalation of the war. His policies and leadership led to the eventual collapse of Germany's war effort and the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.

Major Contributions during the Seven Years' War:

1. William Pitt the Elder (British Prime Minister) - He oversaw Britain's strategic decisions, sought to win the war by undermining the economic power of France and Spain and expanded Britain's influence.

2. Frederick the Great (King of Prussia) - His military genius saw Prussia emerge as a major power in Europe, as he embarked on successful campaigns against Austria, France, and Russia.

3. Empress Maria Theresa (Austrian Empress) - She persisted in reclaiming the territories captured by Prussia and was instrumental in organizing the large coalition against Prussia.

4. Tsarina Elizabeth (Russian Empress) - She was crucial in building a coalition against Prussia, and her support helped turn the tide against Frederick the Great for a period of time.

Comparison:

During WW1, political leaders played significant roles in diplomacy and influencing the post-war world's shape, which were different from the leaders' involvement during the Seven Years' War, where political leaders focused on personal military efforts and the expansion of their empires.

The second question, on the other hand, refers to the major contributions of political leaders during WW1 and how they compare to other major armed conflicts. In this case, the comparison could involve any significant conflict from history, including but not limited to the Seven Years' War. The scope of comparison is broader in the second question, as it would require an analysis of various conflicts and their political leaders, leading to a different discussion than addressing the first question only.
