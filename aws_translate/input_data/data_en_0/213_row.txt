A human would choose "desk drawer" as the most appropriate option for storing an account book when leaving and not needing to bring it along, for several reasons:

1. Accessibility: Placing the account book in a desk drawer ensures that it is easily accessible whenever needed. Desk drawers are usually located where the person works and are readily available when they need to consult or update the account book. This allows for efficient management of the information contained in the book.

2. Organization: Keeping the account book in a desk drawer helps keep a person's workspace organized. Desk drawers typically contain necessary office supplies, stationery, and other work-related items. Storing the account book in a designated location like a desk drawer allows for a systematic approach to managing financial records, making it easier to locate the book when needed.

3. Security: A desk drawer provides a certain degree of security for the account book. While it may not be as secure as a locked safe, it does offer some protection against theft, loss, or unauthorized access. Additionally, the account book can be placed in a locked drawer for added security, if required.

4. Confidentiality: Financial information, such as what is contained in an account book, can be sensitive and confidential. Storing the book in a desk drawer gives the individual a level of privacy, protecting the information from being unintentionally seen by visitors, coworkers, or other unauthorized individuals.

5. Prevention of Damage: A desk drawer also helps protect the account book from any potential damage. Storing it in a secure location, away from potential spills, direct sunlight, or other hazards minimizes the risk of accidental harm befalling the book, thus maintaining its condition and preserving the information it contains.

On the other hand, the alternatives mentioned do not suit the requirements:

- "Kept at accountant" implies that a professional would manage the account book on behalf of the individual, which may not be necessary since they do not need to access the book when leaving. This option may be excessive and expensive for personal finances.
- "Purse" is not an appropriate storage option since it would be with the person when leaving, which contradicts the initial requirement of not needing to bring it along.
- "Bank" is not a suitable option since banks typically do not hold personal documents like account books. They focus on providing financial services and safeguarding financial assets like money, bonds, and other valuable items in secure boxes, rather than physical books.
- "Keeping track of expenses" is not a specific storage location but a purpose for using the account book. Therefore, it does not answer the question.

In conclusion, a human would choose "desk drawer" to store an account book when leaving without needing to bring it, as it provides accessibility, organization, security, confidentiality, and protection from potential damage. It is an effective storage solution that meets the person's needs while not being excessively burdensome or costly.
