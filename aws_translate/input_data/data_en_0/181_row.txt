Reasoning and answer: A small knife is twice the amount of the utensils that costs $10.00 so the knife costs 2 * 10 = $20.00. All total, each little kit will costs $14.00 for mitts, $16.00 for an apron, $10.00 for utensils and $20.00 for a knife for a total of 14 + 16 + 10 + 20 = $60.00. Each kit costs $60.00 and they are currently 25% off so that's a savings of 60 * .25 = $15.00. The kits are $60.00 and they are $15.00 off so they now cost 60 - 15 = $45.00. She needs to buy 3 kits and each kit costs $45.00 so that's 3 * 45 = $135.00.
The answer: 135

Susie has 572 x 1 / 4 = 143 red beans. There were 572 - 143 = 429 beans that are not red. There are 429 x 1 / 3 = 143 white beans. So, there were 429 - 143 = 286 beans left. Therefore, 286 / 2 = 143 beans are green.
The answer: 143
