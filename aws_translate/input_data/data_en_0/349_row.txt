Lord Ha-woo, a connoisseur of the arts, invites Jang-saeng and Gong-gil to perform at his grand estate. During the performance, an enigmatic painting of a clown catches Gong-gil's eye, stirring a deep sense of connection. Lord Ha-woo, noticing Gong-gil's fascination, reveals that the painting has an inscription on the back: "Who is a clown?"
