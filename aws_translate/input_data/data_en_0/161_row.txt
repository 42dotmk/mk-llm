our best team of photo and mapping experts to ensure that this fragile ecosystem was captured accurately and responsibly, while maintaining the highest level of respect for the natural habitats of this unique location. As part of our mission to make the world a more accessible place, this project was aimed at not only helping scientists and researchers in their ongoing work but also to raise awareness about the unique biodiversity that the Galapagos Islands have to offer.

The 19 islands and surrounding waters of the Galapagos archipelago are home to nearly 3,000 unique species, including many that are found nowhere else on Earth. This rich diversity of life has long been a source of fascination for scientists and researchers alike, and Google's Street View project aims to bring this incredible wealth of natural beauty to an even larger audience.

Throughout our time on the islands, the team took great care to minimize any potential disruptions to the marine and terrestrial environments in which we worked. As part of our collaboration with CDF and GNPD, we strictly adhered to guidelines that allowed us to safely and sustainably capture the stunning scenes and rare species that make the Galapagos one of the most biologically diverse places on Earth.

Some of the unforgettable sights captured during our expedition were the iconic Giant Tortoises lounging by lagoons, the Blue-footed Boobies performing their mating dance, and the peculiar Marine Iguanas basking on the rocky shores. These images not only showcase the incredible beauty of the Galapagos, but they also offer viewers an unparalleled educational experience, providing a window into the unique ecosystems that exist on these volcanic islands.

Additionally, Google's Street View also provides valuable information and data to aid in the ongoing conservation efforts that exist aimed at preserving these islands' precious ecosystems. The detailed images captured during our expedition can help to monitor changes in the environment like vegetation growth, animal populations, and the impact of visitor foot traffic on the delicate habitats of the island chain.

After several months of capturing, processing, and curating the images taken during the expedition, Google's Galapagos Islands Street View was finally launched in September 2013. This interactive visual experience allows millions of people around the globe to virtually explore the islands and bear witness to their unmatched natural beauty from the comfort of their own homes.

Ultimately, the results of this collaboration between Google, the Charles Darwin Foundation, and the Galapagos National Parks Directorate will serve as a powerful tool for promoting conservation, education, and awareness about this extraordinary set of Islands. Our hope is that by bringing the Galapagos to life through innovative technology like Google's Street View, we can inspire future generations of scientists, researchers, and environmental stewards to join us in the ongoing effort to preserve and protect the fragile and irreplaceable biodiversity of the Galapagos Islands.
