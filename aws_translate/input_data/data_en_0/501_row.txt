Question: Scott wants to make and freeze a large batch of ratatouille. At the farmers' market he buys 5 pounds of eggplants and 4 pounds of zucchini at $2.00 a pound. He needs 4 pounds of tomatoes that are $3.50 a pound. The onions are $1.00 a pound and he needs 3 pounds. Then he needs a pound of basil which is sold for $2.50 per half pound. If this yields 4 quarts, how much does each quart cost?
Answer: He buys 5 pounds of eggplants and 4 pounds of zucchini so he buys 5 + 4 = 9 pounds of produce. These 9 pounds are $2.00 a pound for a total of 9 * 2 = $18.00. He needs 4 pounds of tomatoes that are $3.50 a pound for a total of 4 * 3.50 = $14.00. He needs 3 pounds of onions that are $1.00 a pound so that's 3 * 1 = $3.00. The basil is sold by the half - pound and he needs a full pound so that's 2.50 * 2 = $5.00. The eggplants and zucchinis cost $18.00, the tomatoes are $14.00, the onions are $3.00 and the basil is $5.00 for a total of 18 + 14 + 3 + 5 = $40.00. This recipe makes 4 quarts and the total price of the vegetables was $40.00 so each quart costs 40 / 4 = $10.00. The answer is 10.

Q: Mark builds an apartment that is 16 by 10 feet. There are 6 rooms in total. All the rooms are the same size except the living room which is as big as 3 other rooms. How big is the living room?
A: Total square footage is 16 * 10 = 160 square feet. . There are 3 + 3 = 6 rooms. 6 - 1 = 5 of them are the same size. If x is the size of the normal room then the square footage of all rooms is 5x + 3x = 8x. So each room is 160 / 8 = 20 square feet. So the living room is 20 * 3 = 60 square feet. The answer is 60.
Question: Barbeck has two times as many guitars as Steve, but Davey has three times as many guitars as Barbeck. If there are 27 guitars altogether, how many guitars does Davey have?
Answer: Let x = the number of guitars Steve has. Barbeck has 2x guitars, and Davey has 3 * 2x = 6x guitars. 2x + 6x + x = 27. 9x = 27. x = 27 / 9 = 3 so Steve has 3 guitars. Barbeck has 2 * 3 = 6 guitars. And Davey has 3 * 6 = 18 guitars. The answer is 18.
