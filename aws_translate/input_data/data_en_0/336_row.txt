Step 1: Identify the genre and time period
First, we need to determine the genre of our movie. In this case, we will go with a crime thriller/mystery, as it fits perfectly with the murder plotline. The movie will be set in present day, to allow for modern forensic technology and detective methods.

Step 2: Create main characters
The next step is creating our main characters. We will have:
Detective Smith - The lead detective on the Ames murder case, fairly experienced and well-respected in the detective community.
Ames - The victim of the murder. Wealthy businessman with a complicated past and a list of potential enemies.
Laura - Ames' estranged wife, a possible suspect in the case.
Jacob - Ames' business partner, another potential suspect.
Rachel - Ames' personal assistant, who discovers the body and appears to know more than she's letting on.

Step 3: Establish the setting
The movie will take place in a metropolitan city with a mix of high-end affluence and a gritty underworld. This contrast will help set the stage for the crime as well as build tension in the unfolding investigation.

Step 4: Develop the plot

Act 1 - Introduce the characters and murder
Detective Smith is called to the crime scene, where Ames has been found dead in his luxurious apartment. It appears that Ames was killed by a gunshot wound to the chest. Smith interviews Rachel, who is visibly distraught, and gathers preliminary information about Ames. Smith contacts Laura and Jacob, who come separately to the apartment.

Act 2 - Delve into the suspects and their motives
Detective Smith begins to investigate the motives of Laura, Jacob, and Rachel. Laura and Ames had a tumultuous relationship and were in the middle of a contentious divorce. Jacob was struggling with the failing business partnership and had financial motive for Ames' death. Rachel is revealed to be secretly in love with Ames and harboring a terrible secret about him. The tension builds as Smith struggles to find concrete evidence pointing to any one person.

Act 3 - The twist and the reveal
Detective Smith discovers a hidden room in Ames' apartment, filled with incriminating materials suggesting Ames was involved in a criminal organization. Rachel, in a moment of vulnerability, confesses to Smith that she knew about Ames' illegal dealings but claims she would never have hurt him. Smith uncovers that Jacob had a secret connection to Ames' criminal past and was the one who tipped off Ames' enemies, resulting in his murder.

Act 4 - The climax and resolution
Detective Smith confronts Jacob with the evidence, and Jacob confesses to his role in Ames' murder. However, Laura finds out about the confrontation, and in a desperate attempt to protect her own financial interests, she kills Jacob. The movie ends with Laura's arrest and Smith's reflection on the complex world of justice, greed, and personal secrets that led to Ames' murder.

By following these four steps, we created a thrilling movie plot centered on Ames' murder that involves elements of suspense, mystery, and unexpected twists that both entertain and engage the audience.
