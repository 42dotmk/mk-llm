Brianna reads two books a month. This year, she was given six new books as a gift, she bought eight new books, and she plans to borrow two fewer new books than she bought from the library. How many of her old books from her old book collection will she have to reread to have two books to read a month this year?
Let's think: Brianna needs 12 * 2 = 24 books to get her through the year. She will borrow 8 - 2 = 6 new books from the library. With the books she was given, the books she bought, and the library books, she will have 6 + 8 + 6 = 20 new books to read this year. Thus, she will need to reread 24 - 20 = 4 of her old books this year.. The answer is: 4.

Spot sells cookies in bags and boxes. Each bag has 7 cookies. Each box has 12 cookies. How many more cookies are in 8 boxes than there are in 9 bags?
Let's think: The total number of cookies in 8 boxes is 8 boxes * 12 cookies / box = 96 cookies. The total number of cookies in 9 bags is 9 bags * 7 cookies / bags = 63 cookies. There are 96 - 63 = 33 more cookies in the boxes than in the bags.. The answer is: 33.

Peggy is moving and is looking to get rid of her record collection. Sammy says that he will buy all of them for 4 dollars each. Bryan is only interested in half of the records but will offer 6 dollars each for the half that he is interested in and 1 dollar each for the remaining half that he is not interested in with the hopes that he can resell them in bulk later. If Peggy has 200 records, what is the difference in profit between Sammy versus Bryan's deal?
Let's think: Sammy is offering to take the whole collection of 200 records and pay Peggy 4 dollars each for them which would net Peggy 200 * 4 = 800 dollars for her entire record collection. Bryan is willing to buy Peggy's entire record collection but at two different price points, half at one point and half at another. Half of Peggy's record collection is 200 / 2 = 100, which means that 100 records will sell for one price and 100 records will sell for another price. Bryan is willing to pay more for the half of the record collection that he is interested in so Peggy would net 100 * 6 = 600 dollars for the first half of her record collection. For the half of the collection that Bryan is just planning on reselling at a later date, he is willing to offer Peggy 100 * 1 = 100 dollars to take off of her hands. In total Bryan is willing to offer Peggy 600 + 100 = 700 dollars for her entire record collection. If Sammy is offering 800 dollars to buy Peggy's entire record collection and Bryan is offering 700 dollars for Peggy's entire record collection, then Peggy's net profit would be 800 - 700 = 100 dollars more by taking Sammy's deal instead of Bryan's deal.. The answer is: 100.

Barney's grocery store sold out all of its items at the beginning of the pandemic, so they ordered extra items to restock the shelves. However, they ended up ordering far too much and have to keep the leftover items in the storeroom. If they ordered 4458 items, sold another 1561 items that day, and have 575 items in the storeroom, how many items do they have left in the whole store?
