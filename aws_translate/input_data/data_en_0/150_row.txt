Q: Janet pays $40/hour for 3 hours per week of clarinet lessons and $28/hour for 5 hours a week of piano lessons. How much more does she spend on piano lessons than clarinet lessons in a year?
A: First find the total Janet spends on clarinet lessons per week: $40 / hour * 3 hours / week = $120 / week. Then find the total Janet spends on piano lessons per week: $28 / hour * 5 hours / week = $140 / week. Then subtract her weekly clarinet spending from her weekly piano spending to find the weekly difference: $140 / week - $120 / week = $20 / week. Then multiply the weekly difference by the number of weeks in a year to find the annual difference: $20 / week * 52 weeks / year = $1040 / year. The answer is 1040.
Question: Ishmael, Ponce, and Jalen measured their weight and realized Ishmael was 20 pounds heavier than Ponce and that Ponce was 10 pounds lighter than Jalen. If Jalen weighed 160 pounds, calculate the average weight of the three?
Answer: Since Ponce weighs 10 pounds lighter than Jalen, he weighs 160 - 10 = 150 pounds. The sum of Jalen and Ponce's weight is 150 + 160 = 310 pounds. Ishmael is 20 pounds heavier than Ponce, meaning he weighs 150 + 20 = 170 pounds. The total weight of the three is 310 + 170 = 480 pounds. The average weight of the three is the total weight divided by their number, which totals 480 / 3 = 160 pounds. The answer is 160.

Q: In three baseball games this week, eighty people watched the second game while 20 fewer people watched the first game than the second game. Then 15 more people watched the third than the second game. If there were a total of 200 people who watched the games last week, how many more people watched the games this week than last week?
A: This week, 80 - 20 = 60 people watched the first game. While 80 + 15 = 95 people watched the third game. A total of 80 + 60 + 95 = 235 people watched the games this week. Thus, 235 - 200 = 35 more people watched the games this week than last week. The answer is 35.
