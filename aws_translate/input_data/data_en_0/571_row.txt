[Question]Jerome has 20 classmates on his cell phone contact list. He has half as many out of school friends as classmates on his contact list. He also has his two parents and his sister on his contact list. How many people are on Jerome's contact list?
[Answer]Jerome has 20 classmates on the list, and has half as many out of school friends on there so he has 20 / 2 = 10 out of school friends on the contact list. He has 2 parents and 1 sister on the contact list, for 2 + 1 = 3 family members on the contact list. Adding the classmates, out of school friends and family members together we get 20 + 10 + 3 = 33 people on his contact list. The answer is 33.
Q: Colbert is building a treehouse out of wooden planks. The treehouse needs 200 wooden planks. A quarter of these planks come from Colbert’s storage, half of these planks come from Colbert’s parents, 20 planks come from Colbert’s friends and he buys the rest from the store. How many planks of wood does he need to buy from the store to finish his treehouse?
A: In Colbert’s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 50 wooden planks. From his parents, there are 200 wooden planks / 2 = 100 wooden planks. So in total, Colbert has not had to buy 50 wooden planks from storage + 100 wooden planks from his parents + 20 wooden planks from his friends = 170 wooden planks. He therefore still needs to buy 200 needed wooden planks – 170 owned wooden planks = 30 wooden planks. The answer is 30.
Question: Jen bought a bag of cookies and ate three-quarters of the bag that day. The next day, she ate half of the remaining cookies. She has 8 cookies left on the third day. How many cookies were in the bag to start?
Answer: On the third day, Jen had half of the second day’s cookies left, so on the second day, she had 8 * 2 = 16 cookies. On the second day, she had 1 / 4 of the first day’s cookies left, so she started with 16 * 4 = 64 cookies in the bag. The answer is 64.
[Question]Josh had 100 gummy bear candies. He decided to give his 3 siblings 10 candies each. Then he gave half of the remaining candies to his best friend. If he only wants to eat 16 gummy bear candies, how many candies are left to be shared with others?
[Answer]Josh gave a total of 3 x 10 = 30 candies to his siblings. He was then left with 100 - 30 = 70 candies. He gave 70 / 2 = 35 candies to his best friend. So he had 70 - 35 = 35 candies left. Since he only wants to eat 16 candies, there are still 35 - 16 = 19 candies left to be shared with others. The answer is 19.
