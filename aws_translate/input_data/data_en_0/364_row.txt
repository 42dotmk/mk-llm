Q: Jane sews 2 dresses a day for 7 days. Then she sews 3 dresses a day for the next 2 days. In the end, she adds 2 ribbons to each dress. How many ribbons does Jane use in total?
A: In 7 days, Jane sews 2 * 7 = 14 dresses. In the next 2 days, Jane sews 3 * 2 = 6 dresses. Jane sews a total of 14 + 6 = 20 dresses. Jane uses a total of 20 * 2 = 40 ribbons. The answer is 40.
Question: Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Answer: We know Claire has spent a total of 24 hours in a day - 4 hours cleaning - 2 hours cooking - 8 hours sleeping = 10 hours crafting and tailoring. Since she split her time equally, she must have spent 10 hours * 0.5 = 5 hours crafting. The answer is 5.
[Question]On a tough week, Haji's mother sells goods worth $800, which is half the amount she sells on a good week. What's the total amount of money she makes if she has 5 good weeks and 3 tough weeks?
[Answer]If on a tough week she sells half what she sells on a good week, then on a good week she sells 800 * 2 = 1600 dollars. If she had 5 good weeks, the amount is 5 * 1600 = 8000 dollars. During the 3 tough weeks, she sells 3 * 800 = 2400 dollars. The total amount she sold in both weeks is 2400 + 8000 = 10400 dollars. The answer is 10400.
Q: A chocolate box contains 200 bars. Thomas and his 4 friends take 1/4 of the bars and decide to divide them equally between them. One of Thomas's friends doesn't like chocolate bars very much and returns 5 of his bars to the box. Later, his sister Piper comes home and takes 5 fewer bars than those taken in total by Thomas and his friends so she can also share with her friends. What's the total number of bars left in the box?
A: Thomas and his friends took 1 / 4 * 200 = 50 bars. The total number of bars left in the box was 200 - 50 = 150 bars. Since there are five of them sharing, each of them got 50 / 5 = 10 bars. After a friend returned 5 bars, there were 150 + 5 = 155 bars in the box. Piper took five fewer bars, that is 50 - 5 = 45 bars. The total remaining bars left in the box is 155 - 45 = 110 bars. The answer is 110.
Question: Donna made a cake to take to a party where the guests ate half the cake. The day after the party, she shared half the leftovers with her brothers. The following day, she ate one piece as a midnight snack. Twice as many pieces as her snack were left. How many pieces was the cake to begin with?
Answer: Donna had 2 * 1 = 2 pieces of cake left. Before her snack, there were 2 + 1 = 3 pieces left. Those 3 pieces were half the leftovers, so she had 3 * 2 = 6 pieces before sharing with her brothers. Those 6 pieces were half the party leftovers, so the cake was 2 * 6 = 12 pieces before the party. The answer is 12.
