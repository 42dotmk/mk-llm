[Question]In his phone gallery, Malachi has the number of selfies he took last year and this year in the ratio of 10:17. If he has 2430 photos in his gallery, how many more photos did he take this year than last year?
[Answer]The total ratio representing the number of photos in the Malachi gallery is 10 + 17 = 27. The difference in the ratios representing the number of photos Malachi took this year and last year is 17 - 10 = 7. This year, Malachi took 7 / 27 * 2430 = 630 more photos than he took last year. The answer is 630.
Q: Christine is subbing aquafaba for egg whites in baking. Every 2 tablespoons of aquafaba is equivalent to 1 egg white. She's making 2 angel food cakes that call for 8 egg whites each. How many tablespoons of aquafaba will she need in order not to use egg whites?
A: Both cakes use 8 egg whites so she would typically use 2 * 8 = 16 egg whites. 2 tablespoons of aquafaba is equivalent to 1 egg white and she needs 16 egg whites to that's 2 * 16 = 32 tablespoons of aquafaba. The answer is 32.
Question: After uploading her video to Youtube, Kallie received 4000 views on the first day. When she checked her channel 4 days later, she realized that the number of views had increased by a number ten times more than the views on the first day. If 50000 more people viewed the video after another two days, determine the number of views the video had gained on Youtube?
Answer: If the number of views on the first day was 4000, the video's views on Youtube increased by 10 * 4000 = 40000 after four days. The total number of views of the video on Youtube after four days was 40000 + 4000 = 44000. If 50000 more people viewed the video, the total number of views that the Youtube video had is 44000 + 50000 = 94000. The answer is 94000.
[Question]Albert noticed a flock of geese flying together in a V formation in the sky overhead. One half of the geese broke off from the formation, flew toward the earth, and landed in some trees. Then, 4 geese flew up, out of the trees, and joined those already flying in the air to make a new V formation in the sky. If the final number of geese flying in the V formation was 12, how many geese were in the first formation Albert noticed in the sky?
[Answer]If the final number of geese was 12, which included the 4 that joined from the trees, then before these 4 joined, there were 12 - 4 = 8 geese in the sky. Since these 8 geese represent the half of geese remaining, then the initial formation contained 8 * 2 = 16 geese. The answer is 16.
