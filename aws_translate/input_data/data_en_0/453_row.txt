The suggested answer provided a brief description of the geologic time scale but did not precisely list the four main eras of time nor identify which one we currently live in. To give a more complete and detailed answer, let me provide you with the information you're looking for.

The geologic history of Earth is split into four primary eras: the Precambrian, the Paleozoic, the Mesozoic, and the Cenozoic. These eras span across billions of years and encompass significant geological, climatic, and evolutionary changes that have shaped our planet.

1. Precambrian Era: This era refers to the time period from Earth's formation, about 4.6 billion years ago, to the beginning of the Paleozoic Era, around 541 million years ago. The Precambrian covers the longest duration of Earth's history and is further divided into three eons, the Hadean, Archean, and Proterozoic. During this era, Earth witnessed the formation of its initial crust, the emergence of single-celled life, and the appearance of early multicellular organisms.

2. Paleozoic Era: This era spans from approximately 541 million to 252 million years ago. It marks the beginning of complex life, with the diversification of organisms during the Cambrian explosion. The Paleozoic Era is further divided into six periods, including the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian. This era saw the emergence of various marine creatures, the evolution of fish, land plants and early reptiles, the formation of coal forests, and ended with the most significant mass extinction event in Earthâ€™s history, the Permian-Triassic extinction.

3. Mesozoic Era: Lasting from about 252 million to 66 million years ago, the Mesozoic Era is also known as the "Age of Reptiles." This era consists of three periods: the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous. During the Mesozoic Era, Earth experienced the reign of dinosaurs, the emergence of mammals, advanced reptiles, and the initial diversification of birds. The Mesozoic Era concluded with the mass extinction event that led to the destruction of the majority of dinosaurs.

4. Cenozoic Era: The final era, which is the one we currently live in, began around 66 million years ago and continues to the present day. The Cenozoic Era is sometimes referred to as the "Age of Mammals" due to the rapid evolution and diversification of mammals following the mass extinction at the end of the Mesozoic Era. The Cenozoic Era is split into three periods: the Paleogene, Neogene, and Quaternary. During this time, the world has witnessed the rise of mammals, the evolution of primates, and the appearance of modern human Homo sapiens, as well as significant changes in Earth's climate, including the Ice Age.

In conclusion, the four primary eras in Earth's geological history are the Precambrian, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic. We currently live in the Cenozoic Era, which has been marked by the rapid development of mammals and the rise of humans as a dominant species. Based on this information, the initial answer did not precisely address the question and should be revised with the provided details.
