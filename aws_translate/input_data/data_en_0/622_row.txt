Question: Dean ordered 2 large pizzas that were each cut into 12 slices. His friends Frank and Sammy came over to enjoy some pizza and watch a movie. Dean was hungry and ate half of the Hawaiian pizza. Frank only ate 3 slices of Hawaiian pizza and Sammy ate a third of the cheese pizza. How many total slices were left over?
Answer: 2 pizzas were ordered and had 12 slices each for a total of 2 * 12 = 24 slices. Dean ate 1 / 2 of a 12 sliced pizza so 12 / 2 = 6 slices were left over. Sammy ate 1 / 3 of a 12 sliced pizza so 12 / 3 = 4 slices were left over. Dean ate 6 slices, Sammy ate 4 and Frank had 3 so 6 + 4 + 3 = 13. They started with 24 slices and 13 slices so 24 - 13 = 11 slices left. The answer is 11.
[Question]Four small panda bears and five bigger panda bears eat 25 pounds and 40 pounds of fresh bamboo sprouts every day, respectively. How many pounds of bamboo do the 9 pandas eat in a week?
[Answer]The small panda bears eat a total of 4 x 25 = 100 pounds of bamboo every day. The bigger panda bears eat a total of 5 x 40 = 200 pounds of bamboo every day. So, the 9 pandas eat a total of 100 + 200 = 300 pounds of bamboo every day. Therefore, they eat a total of 300 x 7 = 2100 pounds in a week. The answer is 2100.
Q: Luna's monthly food budget is equal to 60% of her house rental budget while her phone bill budget is 10% of her food budget. If the total budget of house rental and food budget is $240, how much is Luna's total monthly budget to pay all those expenses?
A: Let x be Luna's house rental budget. The total budget for house and food rental is represented by the equation x + (60x / 100) = 240. The equation becomes 100x + 60x = 24000 after multiplying each term by 100 to get rid of the fraction. By combining like terms, the equation becomes 160x = 24000. Thus, the value of x is 24000 / 160 = 150 which represents the house rental budget. So, Luna's food budget is $240 - $150 = $90. Her phone bill budget is $90 x 10 / 100 = $9. Therefore, Luna's monthly budget for all those expenses is $240 (house and food) + $9 (phone) = $249. The answer is 249.

[Question]At a station, a train comes every 5 minutes leaving 200 passengers and taking 320 others. How many different passengers step on and off a train at the station within an hour?
[Answer]At every passenger exchange there are 200 + 320 = 520 different people. One hour is 60 minutes, so during one hour, a train comes 60 minutes / hour / 5 minutes / train = 12 times. So during one hour, 12 trains * 520 passengers / train = 6240 different passengers step on and off the train. The answer is 6240.
