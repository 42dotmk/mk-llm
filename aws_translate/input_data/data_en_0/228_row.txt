deck was constructed with poor drainage planning, causing water to accumulate and stagnate beneath it, which in turn amplified the erosion process. Unlike the porch, which had been built with adequate slope and gutter systems to channel water away from its foundation, the deck lacked essential water management features, thus exacerbating the deterioration of the underlying soil.

Moreover, the materials used in the construction of the deck - primarily wood and metal fasteners - were more susceptible to water damage, including rot and rust, as compared to the porch's stronger, more durable construction materials such as concrete or brick. Over time, the constant exposure to moisture accelerated the weakening and eventual failure of the deck's support structures, compounding the damage caused by the eroding soil below.

Additionally, the location and landscaping of the two structures played a role in the rate of water-induced erosion. The deck was situated in an area of the property where runoff from the roof, yard, and adjacent hardscape surfaces was more likely to pool and infiltrate the soil beneath it. The porous nature of the soil in that specific area, combined with the lack of proper vegetation or ground cover, facilitated rapid water absorption and soil displacement. Conversely, the porch was built on a more stable and well-draining substrate, and the surrounding landscaping featured strategically planted trees and plants, which helped to mitigate erosion and keep the area under the porch drier.

Another factor contributing to the faster erosion under the deck was the differing maintenance practices applied to both structures. The porch, being a more frequently utilized living space, regularly underwent inspections and minor repair work, ensuring its drainage systems remained clear of debris and its structure maintained its integrity. On the other hand, the deck, being less visible and less frequently maintained, gradually succumbed to minor leaks, clogging gutters, and wood decay, all of which contributed to the continuous moisture buildup and soil erosion beneath.

Finally, the overall design differences between the porch and the deck played a role in the rate of erosion. The porch's closed, elevated, and well-ventilated structure allowed for better air circulation, faster evaporation of moisture, and less direct contact between its foundation and the wet soil below. In contrast, the open design of the deck created an environment in which air circulation was limited, and the wooden support structures were in direct contact with the moist, eroding soil, further escalating the rate of damage over time.

In conclusion, the water eroded the area under the deck faster than the porch due to a combination of factors including poor drainage planning, less durable construction materials, the location and landscaping of the structures, differing maintenance practices, and the overall design of the two structures. Addressing these factors through proper construction, landscaping, and routine maintenance can help to prevent such erosion issues in the future.
