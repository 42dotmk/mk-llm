Question: A soccer ball takes twenty minutes to inflate. Alexia and Ermias are inflating balls, with Alexia inflating 20 balls and Ermias inflating 5 more balls than Alexia. Calculate the total time in minutes they took to inflate all the soccer balls.
Answer: To inflate a soccer ball, it takes 20 minutes, and if Alexia inflated 20 soccer balls, she took 20 * 20 = 400 minutes. Ermias has 5 more soccer balls than Alexia, meaning she has a total of 20 + 5 = 25 soccer balls. If each soccer ball takes 20 minutes to inflate, Ermias took 25 * 20 = 500 minutes to inflate all the soccer balls she had. Alexia and Ermias took 400 + 500 = 900 minutes to inflate all the soccer balls. The answer is 900.
[Question]Gunner has a box of mittens with 20 fewer pairs than a box of plugs. He decides to put 30 more pairs of plugs into the box of plugs. If the box of mittens has 150 pairs of mittens, how many plugs are there?
[Answer]Since there are 20 fewer mittens pairs than the plugs, there are 150 + 20 = 170 pairs of plugs. When Gunner decides to add 30 more plugs pairs into the box of plugs, the number of plug pairs increases to 170 + 30 = 200. Since a pair has two, the 200 pairs of plugs total 200 * 2 = 400 plugs. The answer is 400.
Q: Mrs. Brynlee reduced the prices of items in her store by 20% after the local government gave small businesses in her county a subsidy. If the price of a shirt in the store was $60 and that of the leather jacket was $90, calculate the amount of money Teagan will pay for buying 5 shirts and 10 leather jackets at the reduced prices.
A: If the price of a shirt in the store was $60, its price was reduced by 20 / 100 * $60 = $12. The price of a shirt was reduced to $60 - $12 = $48. Teagan will pay $48 * 5 = $240 for buying 5 shirts. If the initial price of the leather jacket was $90, the price reduced by 20 / 100 * $90 = $18. The final leather jacket after Mrs. Brynlee reduced the price by 20% is $90 - $18 = $72. Teagan will pay $72 * 10 = $720 for buying 10 leather jackets. The amount of money Teagan paid to Mrs. Brynlee for the shirts and the leather jackets is $720 + $240 = $960. The answer is 960.
