(CNN) -- Australia's National Rugby League apologized on Tuesday for the behavior of its players after ABC's "Four Corners" current-affairs program revealed allegations of group sex in 2002 between players and a New Zealand woman. Two other women told the program they were sexually abused by NRL players. Former Cronulla player Matthew Johns said he was unable to say "sorry enough" regarding the incident "Violence against women is abhorrent, and sexual assault and the degradation of women is just that," said David Gallop, the NRL's chief executive. "So much of what we saw [during Monday night's program] was fundamentally indefensible. And if anyone in the game today is ignoring the importance of that message, then frankly they will need to find another career."
