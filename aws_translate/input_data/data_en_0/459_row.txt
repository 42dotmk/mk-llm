Question: Geordie takes a toll road on his drive to work and back every day of his five-day workweek. The toll is $12.50 per car or $7 per motorcycle. Both his car and his motorcycle get 35 miles per gallon of gas and the commute to work is 14 miles. Gas costs him $3.75 per gallon. Geordie drives his car to work three times a week and his motorcycle to work twice a week. How many dollars does he spend driving to work and back on the same route in a week?
Answer: Geordie pays 12.50 * 3 = $37.50 for car tolls driving to work three times a week. He pays 7 * 2 = $14 for motorcycle tolls driving to work twice a week. He drives 14 * 5 = 70 miles to work each five - day workweek. He uses 70 / 35 = 2 gallons of gas on the drive. He spends 3.75 * 2 = $7.50 on gas each week. Thus, he spends 37.50 + 14 + 7.50 = $59 driving to work. Since he drives to work and back from work, he spends 59 * 2 = $118 a week. The answer is 118.

[Answer]The fisherman earns $3 x 8 = $24 per day on Red snappers. He earns $2 x 14 = $28 per day on Tunas. Therefore, the total amount he earns is $24 + $28 = $52. The answer is 52.
Q: Linda was gathering eggs from her chicken coops. When she was done, she had three times as many white eggs as brown eggs. On her way back to the house, she stumbled, dropping her egg basket. Upon inspecting the damage, she found that all 5 of the brown eggs survived, but now she only had a dozen eggs left. How many eggs did Linda break?
A: Linda has 12 eggs left, 5 of which are brown, so 12 - 5 = 7 are white. Linda originally had 3 times as many white eggs as brown eggs, or 3 * 5 = 15 white eggs. So Linda broke 15 - 7 = 8 white eggs. The answer is 8.
Question: A restaurant makes 40 more pizzas than hot dogs every day. If the restaurant makes 60 hot dogs every day, how many pizzas and hot dogs will it make in June?
Answer: If the restaurant makes 60 hot dogs and 40 more pizzas than hot dogs every day, it makes 60 + 40 = 100 pizzas. The total number of pizzas and hot dogs it makes in a day is 100 + 60 = 160. In June, with thirty days, the restaurant will make 30 * 160 = 4800 pizzas and hot dogs in total. The answer is 4800.
[Question]Ken likes to bike when it's raining and can cycle 30 miles in 20 minutes during this time. However, when it's snowing Ken can't stand the cold and can only cycle 10 miles in 20 minutes. If it rains 3 times and snows 4 times in one week, how many miles did Ken reach if he cycles 1 hour a day?
[Answer]For 1 hour on a rainy day, Ken can cycle 3 * 30 = 90 miles. For 1 hour on a snowy day, Ken can cycle 3 * 10 = 30 miles. On the rainy days this week, Ken cycled 90 * 3 = 270 miles. On the snow days of the week, Ken cycled 30 * 4 = 120 miles. In total, Ken cycled 120 + 270 = 390 miles this week. The answer is 390.
