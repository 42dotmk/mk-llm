[Question]Malcolm has 240 followers on Instagram and 500 followers on Facebook. The number of followers he has on Twitter is half the number of followers he has on Instagram and Facebook combined.

Q: Ali has $480. He spent half of it on food, and then he spent a third of what was left on a pair of glasses. How much money did he have left?

Question: Michael makes birdhouses to sell at craft shows. He charges $22 for each large birdhouse, $16 for each medium birdhouse, and $7 for each small birdhouse. This week, he sold 2 large birdhouses, 2 medium birdhouses, and 3 small birdhouses. How much money, in dollars, did he make this week?
Answer: Michael sold 2 large birdhouses for $22 each, so he made 2 * $22 = $44 from large birdhouse sales. Michael also sold 2 medium birdhouses for $16 each, so he made 2 * $16 = $32 from medium birdhouse sales. Michael sold 3 small birdhouses for $7 each, so he made 3 * 7 = $21 from small birdhouse sales. Since Michael made $44 from large birdhouse sales, $32 from medium birdhouse sales, and $21 for small birdhouse sales, he made $44 + $32 + $21 = $97 total this week. The answer is 97.
[Question]Tony tries to drink more water, so he has been tracking how much water he drinks. Yesterday, he drank 48 ounces of water, which is 4% less than what he drank two days ago. How much water did Tony drink two days ago?
