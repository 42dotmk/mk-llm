The animal that has species called Grevy's, Cape Mountain, and Plains, among others, is the zebra. Zebras are part of the Equidae family, which also includes horses and asses. They are native to Africa and are particularly known for their striking black and white striped coats, which may play a role in camouflage, temperature regulation, or social interactions. Each zebra species has distinct features, habitats, and conservation statuses.

1. Grevy's Zebra (Equus grevyi): Also known as the imperial zebra, Grevy's zebra is the largest of the three zebra species. They are found in the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Kenya and Ethiopia. Grevy's zebras have thinner, tighter stripes, large rounded ears, and a white belly. They prefer to live in grassland and savannah habitats. This species is known for being more solitary than the other zebras, with male territories often excluding other male zebras. Grevy's zebra is listed as endangered, with habitat loss, competition for resources with livestock, and reduced water availability being significant threats to their populations.

2. Cape Mountain Zebra (Equus zebra zebra): The Cape Mountain zebra, a subspecies of the mountain zebra (Equus zebra), is found in South Africa. It mainly inhabits the mountainous regions of the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. They are smaller than the other zebra species, and their stripes are narrower and more numerous. Cape Mountain zebras have a distinct dewlap, which is a fold of skin hanging from the throat area. Threats to this subspecies include habitat loss due to agricultural expansion and competition for resources with domestic animals. While their population was once severely reduced, successful conservation efforts have helped the Cape Mountain zebra recover to a point where they are now classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

3. Plains Zebra (Equus quagga): The Plains zebra, also known as the common zebra or Burchell's zebra, can be found throughout much of eastern and southern Africa. They are the most widespread and numerous of zebra species, inhabiting various environments such as grasslands, savannahs, and open woodlands. Plains zebras have broad stripes that are not as tightly spaced as those of Grevy's zebra, yet not as wide as the stripes on mountain zebras. These zebras are highly social animals and are known for forming harems, which are smaller family units within a large social group called a dazzle. Plains zebras serve as an essential prey species for many predators, such as lions, hyenas, and wild dogs. Currently, they are listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List, with their populations mainly affected by habitat loss, poaching for their skins, and competition with livestock for resources.

In conclusion, the animal with species called Grevy's, Cape Mountain, and Plains, amongst others, is the zebra. These three species and subspecies exhibit intriguing adaptations to their environments, social behaviors, and various conservation statuses, making them integral components of Africa's diverse and mesmerizing ecosystems.
