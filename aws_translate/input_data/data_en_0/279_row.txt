Subject: Questions regarding Confirmations

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you in good health and high spirits. As we're approaching the scheduled confirmation event for our company's new platform, I have a few questions that I'd like to have clarified in order to ensure a seamless and trouble-free process. Please kindly find my inquiries listed below:

1. Confirmands List: Would you be able to provide a finalized list of all the individuals who will be participating in the confirmation event? I would like to double-check the names and ensure that everyone has received an invitation, as well as any additional details about the event.

2. Venue and Logistics: Could you please confirm the exact location and date for the confirmation event? In addition to this, it would be helpful to have information about the room setup, seating arrangements, and any AV equipment that will be required for presentations or speeches.

3. Agenda and Schedule: I understand that there will be several sessions throughout the day, and I was wondering if you could share a detailed schedule with time allotments for each session? This would help me in coordinating with the speakers and preparing any necessary materials in advance.

4. Dress Code and Etiquette: Since confirmations are formal occasions, I assume that there will be a specific dress code to adhere to. Please provide any guidelines on the appropriate attire for both male and female attendees, as well as any other general etiquette expectations.

5. Event Program: To ensure a smooth event, it would be tremendously helpful to receive a copy of the event program, including information on any special guests, speakers, and presentations. This will allow our team to properly introduce and acknowledge them during the event.

6. Confirmation Certificates: Could you please confirm if the confirmation certificates will be provided by your team or if we need to arrange for them? In case we need to prepare them, please provide the template/design to be used, as well as any specifics regarding printing and formatting.

7. Post-Confirmation Reception: I understand that there may be a reception or gathering taking place after the confirmation event. Please provide any relevant details, such as the location, duration, and any particular catering or entertainment requirements.

8. Communication Channels: In order to maintain open lines of communication and ensure that we're all on the same page leading up to the event, kindly inform me of any preferred communication channels or points of contact for any last-minute updates or changes.

I truly appreciate your assistance and timely response to these questions, as it will aid in our preparations for the event and allow us to provide a memorable experience for all our participants. Should you have any questions or further information to share, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you once again, and I look forward to working closely with you on this important occasion.

Warm Regards,
