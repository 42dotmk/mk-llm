Orlan gave Allan 20 x 1 / 4 = 5 meters of rope. So he had 20 - 5 = 15 meters left. Then he gave 15 x 2 / 3 = 10 meters of the rope to Jack. Therefore, Orlan is left with 15 - 10 = 5 meters of rope.
The answer: 5
Reverse engineering the question: Orlan gave one-fourth of his 20-meter rope to Allan. He then gave two-thirds of the remaining to Jack. How many meters of rope is left to Orlan?

Reasoning and answer: He uses 1 packet per cup of coffee and he has 2 cups a day so that's 1 * 2 = 2 packets. He wants enough to last him 90 days and he uses 2 packets a day so that's 90 * 2 = 180 packets. The packets come 30 to a box and he needs 180 packets so that's 180 / 30 = 6 boxes of sugar substitute. Each box costs $4.00 and he needs 6 boxes so that's 4 * 6 = $24.00.
The answer: 24

Question: Christopher uses 1 packet of a sugar substitute in his coffee. He has 2 coffees a day. The packets come 30 to a box and cost $4.00 a box. How much will it cost him to have enough sugar substitutes to last him 90 days?

His total expenditure so far is $50 + $35 + $15 = $100. To make a profit of 10%, he has to make a total of $100 + ($100 * (10 / 100) = $110 from sales. To make $110 from the sales of 10 bags, each bag should cost $110 / 10 = $11.
The answer: 11
Reverse engineering the question: While cultivating a small farm, a farmer spent $50 on corn seeds, $35 on fertilizers and pesticides, and $15 on labor. After a successful harvest, he was able to gather 10 bags of corn. How much should he sell each bag, if he wants to make a profit of 10%?

Reasoning and answer: He releases 1 video that is 2 * 6 = 12 minutes long. So each day he releases 2 + 2 + 12 = 16 minutes of videos. That means he releases 16 * 7 = 112 minutes of videos.
The answer: 112

Question: John releases 3 videos on his channel a day. Two of them are short 2 minute videos and 1 of them is 6 times as long. Assuming a 7-day week, how many minutes of video does he release per week?

Uki earns 20 x $1.50 = $30 in selling 20 cupcakes. She earns 10 x $2 = $20 for selling 10 packets of cookies,. Additionally, she earns another 20 x $1 = $20 for selling twenty packets of biscuits. Thus, in a day, she earns an average of $30 + $20 + $20 = $70.                                    Therefore, for five days, Uki earns 5 x $70 = $350. ".
The answer: 350
Reverse engineering the question: Uki owns a bakery. She sells cupcakes at $1.50 each, cookies at $2 per packet, and biscuits at $1 per packet. In a day, she can bake an average of twenty cupcakes, ten packets of cookies, and twenty packets of biscuits. How much will be her total earnings for five days?

On the tall hills, he sleds down 2 tall hills * 4 times per tall hill = 8 times. He sleds down the small hills half as often so he sleds down each hill 4 times per tall hill / 2 = 2 times per small hill. On the small hills, he sleds down 3 small hills * 2 times per small hill = 6 times. So in total, Wilson sled down the hills 8 times on tall hills + 6 times on small hills = 14 times.
The answer: 14
