These two questions, while addressing similar aspects of gender and sexual desire or behavior, are not quite the same and each requires a nuanced examination. The subject is complex and involves biological, psychological, and societal factors.

1. "Is it right that males are more sexual than females?"

This question seems to be asking about the inherent nature of male and female sexuality. Often, the question hinges on societal ideas of men being more 'sexual' beings than women. That said, sexual desire and behavior vary from person to person, regardless of sex and gender, and it's not accurate to say that one gender is "more sexual” than the other.

Biologically, it's argued that men might possess a higher sex drive due to factors such as testosterone levels; however, this doesn't necessarily mean that men are more "sexual.” Women, too, have libido-determining hormones, and recent studies have suggested that women's sexual desires might be more complex than previously thought. 

From a societal standpoint, there are cultural norms and taboos that tend to suppress women's sexuality more than men's. Men may feel more social pressure to brag about or exaggerate their sexual desires and history, while women might feel more pressure to downplay theirs. 

There are exceptions and outliers in both genders, however. It's essential to note that many factors can affect an individual's sexuality, including age, stress levels, religion, personal beliefs, mental health, relationships, and life circumstances. 

2. "Do men want sex more than women?"

This question is a little more specific, but still broad, as it asks directly about the desire for sex. Various research over time shows that men, on average, report thinking about sex more frequently than women and may express a desire for a higher number of sexual partners and more frequent sexual encounters. However, this doesn't mean that every man wants sex more than every woman - one must always consider individual differences.

Moreover, it also could be influenced by social expectations, as discussed earlier. Women may under-report their sexual desires due to societal expectations or perceptions.

An important point to bring in here is that women's desire is often responsive rather than spontaneous, as per some research. This means women may not initiate or actively seek out sex as often as men do but might be just as into the act once it starts. 

Overall, these studies merely indicate trends and averages; they don't uniformly apply to all men or women.

In conclusion, while there can be typical patterns in the sexual behaviors or desires of males and females due to both biological and societal factors, these don't define or limit the range of individual's sexual behavior or interest. Therefore, each question is approaching the topic from a slightly different angle - one is more focused on sexual nature in general, and the other is more directed towards the desire for sex. They are connected but not exactly the same. Remember, sexuality is deeply personal and varies significantly from person to person.
