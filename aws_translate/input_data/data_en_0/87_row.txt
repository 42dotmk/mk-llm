The Philippines is currently in the international spotlight due to two recent developments. Firstly, reports emerged detailing a conversation between US President Donald Trump and Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte last month. Secondly, Duterte, who is already well known for his harsh crackdown on drugs, is considering extending martial law across the entire country as his forces fight against militants connected to ISIS. 

During the now-public telephone call, Trump congratulated Duterte on his approach to the Philippines’ drug problem, stating that he had done an “unbelievable job”. Duterte has previously been criticized by human rights campaigners for enabling the killing of drug dealers and users. Since he assumed power last July, Filipino troops and vigilantes have executed an estimated 6,000 drug dealers, according to the US State Department and the Washington Post.

The conversation between Trump and Duterte also touched on former President Obama, who Duterte labeled as the “scourge” of his nation. Trump sympathized, claiming that Obama failed to “understand” the situation in the Philippines. 

The two leaders continued their conversation by discussing North Korea. Trump stated that the US could not risk the threat posed by Kim Jong Un, who he described as a “madman with nuclear weapons let on the loose like that”. Although Trump was keen to mention the significant firepower possessed by the US, he also stressed that he was not hoping to use it. In turn, Duterte classified Kim as “unstable”, suggesting that China holds the key in the developing situation. 

A fascinating aspect of Trump’s discussion with Duterte related to US submarines. Trump stated that the US had “a lot of firepower over there” referring to the Korean Peninsula. He specifically cited two nuclear submarines, which he claimed were "the best in the world". The involvement of nuclear submarines is likely to provoke further questions regarding Trump's handling of classified information.

The leaked transcript of the telephone call provides some insight into Trump’s interactions with other leaders. It seems that his characteristic blunt style is ever present, both in public and private situations. Furthermore, he frequently offers praise to authoritarian rulers, often seeming unconcerned about the potential human rights abuses that could be tied to such regimes. 

In the meantime, numerous hostages have been taken in the southern island of Mindanao by ISIS-affiliated militants, prompting Duterte to declare martial law. Thousands of citizens have been displaced as a result of the ongoing violence. Furthermore, Duterte himself has hinted that he might extend martial law across the entire country, as he feels that ISIS is making its presence known on the northern island of Luzon. Duterte’s uncompromising approach to the situation has been clearly demonstrated in recent statements: “If I think you should die, you will die. If you fight us, you will die. If there's an open defiance you will die and if it means many people dying, so be it. That's how it is,” he announced to Reuters.
