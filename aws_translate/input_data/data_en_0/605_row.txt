The given statement "It also involves diseases of other systems, where immune reactions play a part in the pathology and clinical features." does not contain the direct answer to the question "Where can these three elements occur in the immune system?" as it is not explicitly mentioning the three elements in question. However, it does involve a discussion about immune system reactions and their roles in disease pathology and clinical features. 

To provide a detailed and long answer to the question, it is essential to know what the three elements being referred to are. Since those three elements aren't specified, let's assume that they could be T-cells, B-cells, and antibodies, as these are three key components in the adaptive immune response.

1. T-cells:
T-cells, or T-lymphocytes, are a type of white blood cell that plays a critical role in the immune system. They are produced in the bone marrow and then mature in the thymus gland, hence the name "T-cells". T-cells can be found in various parts of the body, including the spleen, lymph nodes, blood, and tissues affected by infection. They can recognize and destroy infected cells or cancerous cells, as well as help other cells in the immune system by coordinating responses.

There are two primary types of T-cells:
a. Helper T-cells - These cells assist in activating other immune cells, such as B-cells, to produce antibodies and guide killer T-cells to destroy infected cells.
b. Cytotoxic T-cells (killer T-cells) - These cells locate and kill cells that are infected with viruses or have become cancerous.

2. B-cells:
B-cells, or B-lymphocytes, are another type of white blood cell that is vital in the immune system. They are produced and mature in the bone marrow. B-cells circulate in the blood and lymphatic system and can be found in lymph nodes, the spleen, and other lymphoid tissues. They function by producing antibodies in response to foreign substances known as antigens, which can be found in viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens.

3. Antibodies:
Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins (Ig), are proteins produced by B-cells in response to the presence of antigens. Antibodies can be found in blood plasma, lymph, and within tissues that are directly affected by an infection. They neutralize pathogens by binding to specific antigens, thus preventing them from infecting cells or marking them for destruction by other immune cells. There are five main classes of antibodies: IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE, each with its unique function and location within the immune system.

In conclusion, the three elements in this context - T-cells, B-cells, and antibodies - occur in various parts of the immune system, such as the blood, bone marrow, thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and other tissues affected by infection. They each play a critical role in the adaptive immune response and contribute to the overall protection against pathogens and disease. Although the original statement does not directly answer the question, the connection between these immune system components and their roles in diseases involving immune reactions can be inferred.
