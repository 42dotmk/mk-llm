[Question]A man is returning home from work and trying to decide which route to take. His first route option includes 3 stoplights. This route will take him 10 minutes if all three lights are green, but each light that is red will add 3 minutes to the trip. The second route does not include any stoplights and takes 14 minutes. If the man chooses the first route, how much longer will his trip be if all 3 stoplights are red?
[Answer]If all 3 stoplights are red, the first route will take 10 + 3 * 3 = 19 minutes. Thus, the first route will take 19 - 14 = 5 minutes longer than the second route. The answer is 5.
Q: Taro and Vlad play a video game competition together, earning 5 points for every win. After playing 30 rounds, Taro scored 4 points less than 3/5 of the total points scored. How many total points did Vlad score?
A: If they played 30 rounds, the total possible points from wins are 5 * 30 = 150 points. Scoring 3 / 5 of the total possible points earns you 3 / 5 * 150 points = 90 points. If Taro scored 4 points less than 3 / 5 of the total points, he scored 90 points - 4 points = 86 points. If the total points scored in the game is 150, then Vlad scored 150 points - 86 points = 64 points. The answer is 64.

[Question]Maria's monthly salary is $2000. 20% of her salary goes to paying tax, and 5% goes to insurance. Also, a quarter of the money left after the deductions is spent on utility bills. How much money does Maria have after the deductions and utility bills payment?
[Answer]Maria's deduction for tax is 2000 x 20% = $400. Her deduction for insurance is 2000 x 5% = $100. Maria's total deductions is $400 + $100 = $500. After the deductions, Maria has only $2000 - $500 = $1500 left from her salary. Then, Maria pays $1500 / 4 = $375 for the utility bills. So, Maria has $1500 - $375 = $1125 after the deductions and utility bills payment. The answer is 1125.
Q: A tomato plant has 100 tomatoes. Jane picks 1/4 of that number for use in their house. After a week, she goes back and picks 20 more tomatoes, and the following week picks twice that number. What's the total number of fruits remaining on the tomato plant?
A: When she picks 1 / 4 of the number of tomatoes, she goes home with 1 / 4 * 100 = 25 tomatoes. The total number of tomatoes remaining will be 100 - 25 = 75 tomatoes. After picking 20 more tomatoes the following week, the number of tomatoes remaining is 75 - 20 = 55 tomatoes. The next week she picks twice the number she picked the previous week, that is 20 * 2 = 40 tomatoes. The total number of tomatoes remaining after the final picking is 55 - 40 = 15 tomatoes. The answer is 15.
