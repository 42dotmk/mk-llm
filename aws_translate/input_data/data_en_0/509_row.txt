Here is a breakdown of the key elements often found in a negative tweet:

1. Tone: The overall tone of a negative tweet is usually pessimistic, bitter, or irritated. The author may convey their feelings using strong or harsh words, sarcasm, or by emphasizing certain aspects of the issue.

2. Target: Negative tweets are directed towards a specific target, which can be an individual, a group, or a situation. The target is often identified with blame or held accountable for causing the negative emotions expressed in the tweet.

3. Issue or problem: A negative tweet revolves around a particular issue or problem. The tweet may highlight the negative aspects of the issue, emphasize the consequences, or describe the impact on the author or others.

4. Call to Action: Many negative tweets include a call to action, urging their followers or the targeted party to recognize and address the problem or issue.
