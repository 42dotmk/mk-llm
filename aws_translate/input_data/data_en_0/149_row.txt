The story that led to the creation of the novel "Robinson Crusoe" is the real-life tale of Alexander Selkirk, a Scottish sailor who was marooned on a deserted island and survived for more than four years. Born in 1676 in the coastal town of Lower Largo, Fife, Scotland, Selkirk was a headstrong and independent young man who would later inspire Daniel Defoe to write the classic novel.

Before venturing on his own, Alexander Selkirk had sailed with the buccaneers, specifically under the command of English privateer and explorer, William Dampier. In 1703, he joined the expedition led by Dampier to plunder Spanish ships and territories in the Pacific and South Atlantic Oceans. Selkirk served as the sailing master aboard one of the vessels, the Cinque Ports, commanded by Captain Thomas Stradling.

In 1704, the Cinque Ports and its companion ship, the St. George, had reached the Juan Fernández Islands off the coast of present-day Chile. At that point, the Cinque Ports was in poor condition, and Selkirk began to question its seaworthiness. He raised his concerns with Captain Stradling, advising him to have the ship repaired. However, Stradling dismissed Selkirk's concerns, and the two men's argument escalated to a boiling point.

Selkirk, convinced of the ship's impending doom, insisted on being left behind on the uninhabited island of Más a Tierra (presently known as Robinson Crusoe Island). Realizing that his debate with Captain Stradling was fruitless, Selkirk managed to salvage a few belongings — including a musket, gunpowder, carpenter's tools, a knife, a Bible, some clothing, and navigation equipment — and requested to be left ashore. Stradling complied, and marooned Selkirk on the remote island.

Despite his initial hardships, Selkirk proved to be incredibly resourceful and adaptable in his new environment. He used the resources available on the island to survive profoundly. He hunted wild goats, which had been introduced by earlier sailors, to obtain food and clothing. With the help of feral cats, he controlled the rat infestation, which threatened his food supply and safety. Furthermore, he cultivated vegetables, constructed two huts from local materials, and eventually found a level of comfort in his isolation.

After over four years of living alone on the island, Selkirk was finally rescued on February 2, 1709, by the privateer vessel, the Duke, under the command of Woodes Rogers. Rogers wrote an account of Selkirk's ordeal, and the story became widely known in England. Daniel Defoe used Selkirk's astonishing tale as inspiration for his novel "Robinson Crusoe," published in 1719, although he modified the story and added various fictional elements.

Defoe's novel went on to achieve great success and literary significance, ultimately securing a place in the canon of world literature. Nevertheless, the real-life story of Alexander Selkirk's remarkable survival on a deserted island serves as a testament to human resilience and resourcefulness, transcending the boundaries of fiction and establishing itself as an iconic, adventurous, and inspiring tale.
