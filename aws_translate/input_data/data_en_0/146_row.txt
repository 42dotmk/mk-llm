Canada gained its independence from Britain through a gradual process that took place over several years. The journey towards independence was marked by milestones such as the enactment of the British North America Act (BNA Act) in 1867, the Statute of Westminster in 1931, and the patriation of the Canadian Constitution in 1982. Here is an overview of this process:

1. British North America Act (1867): Also known as the Constitution Act, 1867, the BNA Act marked the beginning of the Confederation of Canada. The act united the British colonies of Canada (which were separated into two provinces, Ontario and Quebec), Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick into a single Dominion of Canada, with a federal system of government. This was the first step towards Canadian independence, as the new nation was granted the right to self-govern in domestic matters. However, Britain retained legislative control over certain aspects of governance, such as foreign policy and constitutional amendments.

2. Statute of Westminster (1931): The Statute of Westminster was a significant milestone in asserting Canada's legislative independence from Britain. Until this point, Canadian laws were subject to British approval, as were those of several other self-governing dominions within the British Empire. The Statute of Westminster changed this by granting these dominions full legal freedom, equal to that of the United Kingdom. While the British Parliament could still enact laws relating to the dominions, it could do so only at the request and with the consent of the respective dominion. This statute provided Canada with more control over its affairs, such as foreign policy and defense.

3. Patriation of the Canadian Constitution (1982): Before the patriation of the Canadian Constitution, Britain continued to maintain some control over Canada's constitutional framework. Any amendments to the BNA Act required the approval of the British Parliament, as it was still an act of their legislature. This changed in 1982, when the Canadian Constitution was patriated, thereby bringing it entirely under Canadian jurisdiction. The repatriation process involved the passing of the Canada Act 1982 by the British Parliament and the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1982, by the Canadian Parliament. The Constitution Act, 1982, included the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which serves as the fundamental law of the country and outlines various civil rights and liberties. It also established a framework for constitutional amendments, eliminating the need for Canadian requests to the British Parliament.

In conclusion, while it is convenient to look for a specific date or event to signify Canada's independence from Britain, it is important to understand that the process was gradual and involved a series of milestones. These milestones, namely the British North America Act in 1867, the Statute of Westminster in 1931, and the patriation of the Canadian Constitution in 1982, highlight the process of gaining political autonomy and developing a distinct Canadian identity separate from that of Britain.
