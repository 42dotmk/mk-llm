The model chose to act in a movie rather than a commercial because the movie paid more money. The decision to opt for the movie over the commercial was a well-thought-out one, taking into account various factors that would impact not only the model's financial situation, but also their career trajectory, personal preferences, and the potential benefits in terms of exposure and opportunities.

One of the primary reasons behind this decision was the financial aspect. Movies often have bigger budgets and pay better than commercials; this holds especially true when considering a lucrative film project with a star-studded cast, a high-profile director, or a well-established production studio. In such cases, the remuneration offered to the model could be significantly larger compared to that of a commercial, even one that airs for an extended period of time.

Apart from the difference in monetary gains, the model likely considered the career growth and opportunities that would result from being part of a successful movie. Acting in a film could provide the model with valuable connections and networking opportunities within the entertainment industry, while also helping them to broaden their skill set as an actor. Gaining experience in a full-length feature, as opposed to a brief commercial spot, would also allow the model to showcase a more diverse range of acting abilities, which could open doors to more significant roles in the future.

Furthermore, the model may have found the creative challenge of acting in a movie more fulfilling than starring in a commercial. Film projects often carry more interesting and varied plotlines and character arcs, making them an attractive prospect for a model looking to delve deeper into the world of acting. Such projects also offer a chance to work for extended periods with other talented professionals, including actors, directors, writers, and crew members, which can lead to a more rewarding work environment.

Exposure also plays a significant role in the decision-making process. A well-received movie with huge box-office success can generate more buzz, media coverage, and recognition than most commercials. This increased visibility could help the model gain more attention from fans, critics, and other industry professionals, ultimately contributing to the model's overall brand value and popularity.

Lastly, the model might have considered the issue of longevity. While commercials can have a shorter lifespan due to their nature, a movie has the potential to be remembered and celebrated for years to come, granting a sense of permanence to the model's contribution to the entertainment landscape.

In conclusion, the decision for the model to act in a movie over a commercial was likely motivated by a confluence of factors such as financial rewards, career growth, personal fulfillment, increased exposure, and the prospects of creating a lasting impact. By choosing the higher paying movie opportunity, the model not only ensured better financial compensation but also improved their chances of building a more robust and enduring acting career.
