Q: Savannah is wrapping presents for her friends and family for Christmas. She has bought 3 rolls of wrapping paper to wrap 12 gifts. If it takes 1 roll to wrap 3 gifts and 1 roll to wrap 5 other gifts, if there is no wrapping paper leftover after Savannah wraps the rest of the gifts, how many gifts did she wrap with the third roll of paper?
A: Savannah has 12 gifts to give her friends and family and has already wrapped 3 gifts + 5 gifts = 8 gifts already wrapped with the first two rolls of paper. She started off with 12 gifts to wrap and has already wrapped 8, 12 - 8 = 4 gifts she wraps with the third roll of paper. The answer is 4.
Question: Oliver is working out in a gym. On Monday he worked out for 4 hours, and the next day for 2 hours less. On Wednesday he decided to work out twice as much as on Monday. On Thursday the gym was closed, so Oliver needed to exercise at home which took twice as much time as on Tuesday. How many hours in total have Oliver worked out during these four days?
Answer: On Tuesday, Oliver worked out for 4 - 2 = 2 hours. On Wednesday he decided to work out twice as much as on Monday, so for 2 * 4 = 8 hours. On Thursday, at home, Oliver trained twice as much as on Tuesday, so for 2 * 2 = 4 hours. In total Oliver trained for 4 + 2 + 8 + 4 = 18 hours. The answer is 18.
[Question]In a block of flats, there are 120 apartments. 85% of them have at least 1 resident, while 60% of the apartments have at least two residents. How many apartments have only one resident?
[Answer]At least one person lives in 85 / 100 * 120 = 102 apartments. At least two persons live in 60 / 100 * 120 = 72 apartments. So in every of the 102 - 72 = 30 apartments, only one person is living. The answer is 30.
Q: The county fair was hosting a pumpkin contest to see who could grow the biggest pumpkin in pounds. Brad entered his pumpkin with a weight of 54 pounds. Jessica's was half the weight of Brad's. Betty's pumpkin weight 4 times the amount of Jessica's pumpkin. What is the difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin in pounds?
A: Jessica's pumpkin weighs half the weight of Brad's 54 - pound pumpkin so 54 / 2 = 27 pounds. Betty's pumpkin weighs 4 times the amount of Jessica's 27 - pound pumpkin so it weighs 4 * 27 = 108. Betty has the heaviest pumpkin at 108 pounds while Jessica's is the lowest at 27 pounds so the difference is 108 - 27 = 81 pounds. The answer is 81.
Question: Mary and Jimmy start running from the same spot, but in opposite directions. Mary runs at 5 miles per hour and Jimmy runs at 4 miles per hour. What is the distance between them after 1 hour?
