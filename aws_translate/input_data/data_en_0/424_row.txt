In order to answer this question, it is essential to understand the context behind the interview you mentioned, which was a 2008 interview between then-Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and CBS News anchor Katie Couric. Palin, as a vice-presidential candidate on the Republican ticket with Senator John McCain, was subjected to a series of interviews that would help build her public image and inform the American electorate of her qualifications, views, and experience.

Katie Couric, as a respected journalist and television personality, conducted this particular interview in a professional manner, aiming to maintain objectivity and provide a platform for Palin to articulate her ideas, experiences, and political positions. To that end, it would be expected for Couric to address her interviewee with the appropriate title, and for Palin, as the sitting Governor of Alaska, that title would be "Governor Palin."

There could be multiple reasons as to why Katie Couric addressed Sarah Palin as "Governor Palin":

1. Respect for her official title: As mentioned earlier, addressing her as "Governor Palin" is a sign of respect for her official post and position in the government. As a journalist, it is essential to maintain professional decorum and show respect to your interviewee, regardless of personal opinions or biases.

2. Reinforcing her status and experience: By addressing her as "Governor Palin," Couric was highlighting Palin's experience and status as an elected official. This would serve a dual purpose - it would remind the audience of Palin's qualifications for the vice-president position and also convey the fact that Couric, as an impartial journalist, was giving Palin the opportunity to present her case in a fair manner.

3. Maintaining objectivity: Using Governor Palin's appropriate title helped Couric establish and maintain objectivity in the interview. By consistently addressing her by her professional title, Couric ensured that her questions and the overall structure of the interview remained neutral and unbiased.

With regards to the criticisms of the media's treatment of Palin and Couric's interview, it is worth noting that the role of the media, and specifically journalists, is to scrutinize public figures and ensure that they are held accountable for their actions, statements, and qualifications. Couric's interview, by addressing Palin with her appropriate title and asking questions about her foreign policy experience, among other topics, was in line with this responsibility.

In conclusion, Katie Couric addressed Sarah Palin as "Governor Palin" during the interview in order to show respect for her official title, reinforce her status and experience, and maintain objectivity throughout the interview. It is a common practice for journalists to address public figures by their proper titles as a sign of professional decorum, and Couric's interview with Palin was no exception. The criticisms against the media's treatment of Palin and this interview should also be viewed through the lens of journalistic responsibility and the media's role in scrutinizing public figures.
