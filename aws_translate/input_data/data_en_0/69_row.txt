Oracle bones, also known as "turtle shells" or "dragon bones," were used extensively in ancient China, particularly during the Shang (c. 1600-1046 BCE) and Western Zhou (1046-771 BCE) dynasties, for divination purposes. The use of oracle bones served as an essential medium in predicting future events, resolving uncertainties, and seeking guidance from ancestors and deities in various aspects of life including agriculture, weather, warfare, and health issues. This practice, known as pyromancy, played a central role in the ruling class's decision-making process and was a significant component of ancient Chinese culture and religion.

Oracle bones were mostly made from turtle plastrons (the underside shells) and ox scapulae (shoulder bones), but occasionally other animal bones were used as well. The divination process, practiced by specialized diviners, followed certain steps:

1. Preparation: The oracle bones were cleaned, polished, and had a smooth surface prepared for inscribing the questions. They were often drilled with small holes to control the direction and pattern of cracks that would form during the divination process.

2. Inscription: The questions were inscribed onto the bones with a sharp bronze or stone tool. These inscriptions, written in an early form of Chinese script known as "oracle bone script," would typically address deities, ancestors, or natural elements, seeking guidance or explanations for particular situations.

3. Divination: The diviner placed the oracle bone over a fire or applied heat with a heated metal rod onto the prepared holes. The heat would cause the bone to crack, producing distinct patterns and lines.

4. Interpretation: The diviner would then interpret the patterns and cracks to provide an answer to the question. The answer was often inscribed alongside the original question on the oracle bone, creating a permanent record of the divination process and result.

5. Preservation: The oracle bones that had been used for divination were carefully stored, often in pits, as they were considered sacred items that held considerable spiritual power. Over time, large collections of oracle bones were accumulated and preserved.

The discovery of these inscribed oracle bones has greatly enriched our understanding of ancient Chinese history, culture, and language. They offer a valuable glimpse into the belief systems, political structure, social customs, and even the daily lives of people living during that period. Additionally, the oracle bones script is the earliest identifiable form of written Chinese, which provides vital information for the study of the development of the Chinese writing system and language.

In summary, the Chinese used oracle bones as a divination tool to seek guidance from ancestors and deities in various aspects of life. This practice was deeply rooted in ancient Chinese culture and played a crucial role in decision-making processes among the ruling class. The inscriptions found on these oracle bones have since become invaluable resources for studying ancient Chinese history, language, and beliefs.
