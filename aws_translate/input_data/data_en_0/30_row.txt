Cells are the basic units of the structure and function of not only tigers, but also other living organisms, including mammals, animals, humans, and plants. Let's discuss each of these in detail to understand why cells are the basic units of their structure and function.

1. Mammals: Tigers are a part of the mammalian group, characterized by having fur or hair, giving birth to live young, and producing milk to nourish their offspring. Like tigers, other mammals such as humans, dogs, and whales are composed of cells, each of which work collectively to build tissues, organs, and organ systems, resulting in the complex body structures and functions that enable these creatures to survive and thrive in their respective environments.

2. Animals: The animal kingdom encompasses a diverse range of species, from mammals and birds to reptiles and amphibians. All these multicellular organisms share a common feature: their bodies are composed of cells - specialized units that perform various functions within the organism. From the tiniest microscopic protozoa to the largest whales, all animals rely on cells to build their body structures and carry out vital physiological processes such as digestion, respiration, and reproduction.

3. Humans: As a part of the mammal category, humans are also composed of cells, which make up tissues, organs, and organ systems. The human body contains trillions of cells, which vary in their structure and function, enabling the intricate processes of life to occur, such as the beating of the heart, the electrical signaling of the nervous system, and the ability to regenerate new skin when injured.

4. Plants: Although plants may seem drastically different from animals, they too rely on cells as their fundamental structural and functional units. Plant cells differ from animal cells in several ways, including the presence of a rigid cell wall, chloroplasts (the site of photosynthesis), and a large central vacuole. These unique cellular components enable plants to perform functions such as growing towards light, producing food through photosynthesis, and providing structural support to prevent collapsing.

However, cells are not the basic units of structure and function for water, ice, or the Sun, as these entities are not living organisms:

1. Water: Water is a chemical compound composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (H2O). Water molecules do not contain cells, as they are not living organisms but rather an essential component of living organisms.

2. Ice: Ice is the solid form of water that occurs when water molecules bond together in a crystalline structure at freezing temperatures. Like water, ice does not have cells and is not a living organism.

3. The Sun: The Sun is a massive celestial body primarily composed of hydrogen and helium gases undergoing nuclear fusion. As a non-living entity, the Sun does not contain cells, which are found exclusively in living organisms.

In summary, cells are the basic units of the structure and function of mammals, animals, humans, and plants, but not for water, ice, or the Sun.
