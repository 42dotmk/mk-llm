The process of stellar evolution, which includes the aforementioned steps of a star burning its hydrogen, expanding into a red giant, and eventually collapsing into a white dwarf, is indeed inherently dependent on the composition and mass of a star. Any perturbation in the amount of hydrogen within a star is likely to affect its evolution directly or indirectly.

To understand the potential impact of the perturbation hypothesis – that there is less hydrogen in the star – we will analyze its effect on each step of the process.

1. A star burns in space: A star's energy is generated through nuclear fusion, specifically the fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium. If the star has less hydrogen, the rate at which nuclear fusion progresses will be reduced in comparison to stars with a larger hydrogen content. Consequently, the star will produce less energy and burn at a slower pace.

2. Eventually, it burns all its hydrogen: With less hydrogen available for nuclear fusion, the star will reach the end of this phase more rapidly. Since hydrogen fuels the fusion reactions and maintains the balance between the gravitational forces pulling the star inward and the outward pressure exerted by the energy released from fusion, the depletion of hydrogen will lead to the next phase sooner.

3. Becomes a red giant: When a star has consumed most of its hydrogen, it moves on to fusing helium into heavier elements. The outer envelope of the star will expand, and the star will become a red giant. With less hydrogen in the core initially, this process will be expedited, leading to a shorter main-sequence lifespan for the star.

4. Once the red giant burns itself out: In the red giant phase, helium accumulates in the core while the remainder of the hydrogen is burned in a shell around the core. If the star initially had less hydrogen, it might have a smaller envelope during this phase, further accelerating the process.

5. The core of the star collapses: As the helium core contracts, the outer layers of the star are expelled, forming a planetary nebula. With the perturbation hypothesis, the core might be smaller and contract more rapidly, and the resulting planetary nebula might also be smaller or less prominent.

6. The gases will start to disperse: Due to the reduced quantity of hydrogen, the dispersed gases might be less in volume, and their dispersal into space might occur at a different rate than in the case of a star with a larger hydrogen content.

7. Only the core is left: Following the dispersal of the outer layers, the star's core will remain, forming a white dwarf. With less hydrogen and a smaller core in the perturbation hypothesis, the white dwarf's size, temperature, and luminosity may also be impacted.

In conclusion, a reduction in the amount of hydrogen within a star, as proposed in the perturbation hypothesis, would indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the star's evolution process. The overall lifespan and characteristics of the star would be altered, leading to differences in size, brightness, and the eventual outcome of the star's evolution.
