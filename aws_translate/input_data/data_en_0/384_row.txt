Q: John ends up damaging his hearing aids. He needs to replace both of them. They cost $2500 each. Insurance covers 80% of the cost. How much does he personally have to pay?
A: The cost of the hearing aids is $2500 * 2 = $5000. So insurance covers $5000 * .8 = $4000. That means it cost him $5000 - $4000 = $1000. The answer is 1000.
Question: Herman likes to feed the birds in December, January and February. He feeds them 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon. How many cups of food will he need for all three months?
Answer: December has 31 days, January has 31 days and February has 28 days for a total of 31 + 31 + 28 = 90 days. He feeds them 1 / 2 cup in the morning and 1 / 2 cup in the afternoon for a total of 1 / 2 + 1 / 2 = 1 cup per day. If he feeds them 1 cup per day for 90 days then he will need 1 * 90 = 90 cups of birdseed. The answer is 90.
[Question]It takes 30 minutes to make pizza dough and another 30 minutes in the oven for the pizza to cook. If one batch of pizza dough can make 3 pizzas but the oven can only fit 2 pizzas at a time, how many hours would it take for Camilla to finish making 12 pizzas?
[Answer]Camilla needs 12 / 3 = 4 batches of pizza dough. 4 batches of pizza would require 30 x 4 = 120 minutes. Camilla needs to bake the pizzas 12 / 2 = 6 times. 6 times in the oven would take 30 x 6 = 180 minutes. Altogether, it would take 120 + 180 = 300 minutes to finish making 12 pizzas. 300 minutes is 300 / 60 = 5 hours. The answer is 5.
Q: Matthew, the baker, arrives at work early every morning to make his famous caramel-apple coffee cakes for the day. It usually takes Matthew 1 hour to assemble ingredients, 1.5 hours to bake the cakes, and another 1 hour to decorate each cake with cinnamon sprinkles. One day, Matthew's oven failed to reach the correct temperature and it took twice as long for the cakes to bake as they usually take. On that day, how long did it take, in hours, for Matthew to make his famous caramel-apple coffee cakes?
A: Twice 1.5 hours is 2 * 1.5 = 3 hours. Thus, on that day, it took Matthew 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 hours to make the cakes. The answer is 5.
Question: Emily wants to know how much it rained last week. She sees that it rained 2 inches on Monday morning and 1 more inch later that day. It rained twice that much on Tuesday. It did not rain on Wednesday but on Thursday it rained 1 inch. The biggest storm was on Friday when the total was equal to Monday through Thursday combined. What was the daily average rain total for the week?
Answer: The total rain was 2 inches + 1 inches = 3 inches on Monday. The total rain was 2 * 3 inches = 6 inches on Tuesday. The total rain was 0 inches + 1 inch = 1 inch across Wednesday and Thursday. The total rain was 3 inches + 6 inches + 1 inch = 10 inches on Friday. There were 3 inches + 6 inches + 1 inch + 10 inches = 20 inches total last week. 20 inches / 5 days = 4 inches average daily rain. The answer is 4.
