Baghdad (CNN) -- "Significant differences" remain between world powers and Iran in negotiations over its nuclear program, European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Thursday. But, Ashton said, "it's clear that we both want to make progress." The parties "agree on further discussions to expand common ground," she said, and have a clear direction going forward. Negotiations between Iran and the so-called P5+1 -- the United States, France, Britain, Russia, China and Germany -- will continue next month in Moscow. Iran's top negotiator, Saeed Jalili, asserted Iran's right to pursue peaceful nuclear energy in his remarks to reporters. Later, in an interview with CNN, Jalili said there was progress.
