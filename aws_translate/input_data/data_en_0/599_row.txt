First, let's discuss Edward Snowden and his actions before addressing both questions:

Edward Snowden is a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee and National Security Agency (NSA) contractor who leaked classified information from the NSA in 2013. This information revealed extensive global surveillance programs, many of which were conducted by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance. The leaked documents brought light to the mass surveillance of internet activity, phone records, and foreign government leaders.

Now, let's address each question separately:

1. Is Edward Snowden a hero?
Answering this question requires a discussion of whether Snowden's actions had a positive or negative impact on society and citizens' rights. To determine if he is a hero, we must consider if his motives were genuine, as well as the consequences of his actions for both the USA and the world. 

On one hand, supporters argue that Snowden is a hero who defended citizens' rights and uncovered governmental abuse of power. They believe he ignited an important global conversation about privacy and government surveillance, leading to increased awareness about digital privacy and eventual legislative changes. 

On the other hand, critics assert that Snowden compromised national security by revealing classified information, which potentially weakened intelligence operations against terrorist organizations and other threats. They argue that his methods were irresponsible and dangerous, and that he should have reported his concerns to appropriate oversight bodies instead of leaking classified information to the media.

2. Would you characterize Edward Snowden as a hero, a patriot, both, or neither? Why?
Characterizing Edward Snowden involves discussing whether his actions were heroic and patriotic, or not. A hero is someone who takes personal risks for the greater good, whereas a patriot is a person who vigorously supports their country and is prepared to defend it against enemies or detractors.

Arguing that Snowden is a hero implies that one believes his actions were taken with the intention of benefiting society. People who hold this view may think he was willing to sacrifice his personal safety and freedom to expose violations of citizens' privacy rights. If one believes that Snowden's actions were primarily motivated by a love for his country and a desire to protect its ideals of freedom and democracy, then they might consider him a patriot.

If one believes that Snowden's actions demonstrate both heroic and patriotic qualities, labeling him as both a hero and a patriot would be appropriate. Conversely, if one concludes that his actions were neither heroic nor patriotic, then neither label would apply.

In summary, while the first question focuses on whether Snowden's actions were heroic, the second question asks for a broader characterization that includes heroism, patriotism, both, or neither. So, the answer to whether the two questions are asking the same thing is (A) no. The second question expands the scope of characterization, while the first question solely focuses on heroism.
