Question: At a flea market, Hillary sells handmade crafts for 12 dollars per craft. Today, Hillary sells 3 crafts and is given an extra 7 dollars from an appreciative customer. Later on, Hillary deposits 18 dollars from today's profits into her bank account. How many dollars is Hillary left with after making the deposit?
Answer: Hillary sells 3 crafts for 12 dollars each, for a total of 3 crafts * $12 / craft = $36. She receives an extra 7 dollars from a customer, increasing the total to $36 + $7 = $43. She then deposits 18 dollars in the bank, leaving her with $43 - $18 = $25. The answer is 25.

Q: Maria's monthly salary is $2000. 20% of her salary goes to paying tax, and 5% goes to insurance. Also, a quarter of the money left after the deductions is spent on utility bills. How much money does Maria have after the deductions and utility bills payment?
A: Maria's deduction for tax is 2000 x 20% = $400. Her deduction for insurance is 2000 x 5% = $100. Maria's total deductions is $400 + $100 = $500. After the deductions, Maria has only $2000 - $500 = $1500 left from her salary. Then, Maria pays $1500 / 4 = $375 for the utility bills. So, Maria has $1500 - $375 = $1125 after the deductions and utility bills payment. The answer is 1125.
Question: An animal shelter recently took in twelve cats. The shelter already had half that number of cats. Two days later, three had been adopted. The next day, one of the cats had five kittens, and one person arrived to pick up one of the cats that was their missing pet. How many cats does the shelter have now?
Answer: The shelter started with 12 / 2 = 6 cats. The cats they took in increased the number to 12 + 6 = 18 cats. Three cats were adopted, so they had 18 - 3 = 15 cats. One cat had 5 kittens, which increased the number of cats to 15 + 5 = 20 cats. The pet owner came to get his missing cat, so they now have 20 - 1 = 19 cats. The answer is 19.
