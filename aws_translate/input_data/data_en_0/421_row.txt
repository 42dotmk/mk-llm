One notable year in the life of Charlotte Bronte is 1847. This year was momentous for her due to the publication of her first novel, "Jane Eyre." Not only did this event mark the beginning of Charlotte Bronte's career as an esteemed author, but it also impacted the literary world significantly.

Born in 1816, Charlotte Bronte was the third of six children in her family. She was raised in a rural English parsonage and educated largely by her father, Patrick Bronte, and her aunt, Elizabeth Branwell. Charlotte's mother, Maria, had passed away when she was very young, leaving her father to care for the children alongside her aunt. At the age of 20, Charlotte served as a governess for several years, an experience that would later inform her novel "Jane Eyre."

In 1846, Charlotte, along with her sisters Emily and Anne, published a collection of poetry under the gender-neutral pseudonyms, Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. The collection, titled "Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell," did not reach commercial success but helped the sisters test the waters of the literary world. However, this marked the beginning of their courageous journey as women writers in a male-dominated field.

In 1847, Charlotte started to attract the attention of publishers and submitted her manuscript for "The Professor" to various firms. Sadly, it was rejected several times, but in that same year, another publisher, Smith, Elder & Co. took an interest in her and requested another novel from Charlotte. This led to the submission and eventual publication of "Jane Eyre."

"Jane Eyre" is largely considered to be semi-autobiographical, drawing on incidents and environments from Charlotte Bronte's life. For instance, the boarding school that the protagonist, Jane Eyre, attends parallels Charlotte’s experience at the Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge, a harsh and disciplinary institution. Additionally, during her time as a governess, Charlotte was deeply in love with a married man, her employer – a situation she embeds in her novel through Jane's relationship with Mr. Rochester.

Published on October 16, 1847, "Jane Eyre" became an instant success. It was quickly hailed as a literary masterpiece, garnering positive reviews and praise from George Henry Lewes, William Makepeace Thackeray, and Elizabeth Gaskell. Gaskell would later become a close friend of Charlotte and write her biography, "The Life of Charlotte Bronte," in 1857.

In 1847, Charlotte's sisters Emily and Anne also published their novels, "Wuthering Heights" and "Agnes Grey," under their respective pseudonyms. Sadly, both Emily and Anne would pass away within three years of the publishing, leaving Charlotte as the only surviving author among the sisters.

1847 was indeed a turning point in Charlotte Bronte's life, as it thrust her and her sisters into the limelight, transforming them from three unknown Yorkshire spinsters into literary giants of their era. Charlotte would go on to write additional novels, like "Shirley" (1849) and "Villette" (1853), further cementing her status as a respected and influential author of the 19th century.
