Q: James has an old printer that crumples every seventh page and blurs the ink on every third page. If he prints 42 pages, how many are neither crumpled or blurred?
A: First find the total number of pages that are crumpled: 42 pages / 7 = 6 pages. Then find the total number of pages that are blurred: 42 pages / 3 = 14 pages. Then find the number of pages that are both blurred and crumpled by finding how many numbers are less or equal to 42 and divisible by both 3 and 7: there are two, 21 and 42. Then subtract the number of crumpled and blurred pages from the total number of pages, and add the number of pages that were double - counted because they were both blurred and crumpled: 42 pages - 6 pages - 14 pages + 2 pages = 24 pages. The answer is 24.
Question: A library has 7 rectangular tables and the remaining tables will be square tables. A rectangular table seats 10 pupils while a square table seats 4 pupils. How many square tables are needed so that 90 pupils can read at the same time?

[Question]A Statistics student wants to find out the average daily allowance of the middle school students. According to his survey, 2/3 of the students receive an average of $6 allowance per day while the rest gets an average of $4 a day. If he surveyed 60 students, what is the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day?
[Answer]There are 60 students x 2 / 3 = 40 students who have a $6 daily allowance. While there are 60 students - 40 students = 20 students who have a $4 daily allowance. The sum of the allowances of the 40 students who received $6 daily is 40 students x $6 / day = $240. The sum of the allowances of the 20 students who received $4 daily is 20 students x $4 / day = $80. The total daily amount of money of those 60 students is $240 + $80 = $320. The answer is 320.
Q: Mrs. Wilsborough saved $500 to buy concert tickets for her family. She bought 2 VIP tickets at $100 each and 3 regular tickets at $50 each. How much of her savings does Mrs. Wilsborough have after she buys the tickets?
A: The 2 VIP tickets amount to $100 x 2 = $200. The 3 regular tickets amount to $50 x 3 = $150. Thus, the total cost of the tickets is $200 + $150 = $350. Therefore, Mrs. Wilsborough is left with $500 - $350 = $150 of her savings. The answer is 150.
