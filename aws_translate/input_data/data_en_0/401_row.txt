Preparing to crack the GATE exam in 5 months and cracking the GATE CS 2017 exam in 3 months are slightly different in terms of the time duration and the specific subject mentioned (CS referring to Computer Science). However, the core ideas and methods for preparation remain similar. Here is a detailed plan for preparing for the GATE exam in a limited time frame and optimizing your chances of success:

1. Know your syllabus and exam pattern: For GATE preparation, the first and foremost thing to do is to understand the GATE syllabus for the specific stream you are planning to appear for (in this case, Computer Science). Familiarize yourself with the exam pattern, including the time duration, number of questions, and marking scheme, etc.

2. Collect study material: Gather the best and most relevant study materials, books, and resources for GATE preparation. Consult seniors, teachers, or online forums to find the most recommended materials. For Computer Science, popular authors and books include Cormen for Algorithms, Galvin for Operating Systems, and Tanenbaum for Computer Networks, among others.

3. Make a study schedule: Based on the time constraint of 3 or 5 months and the GATE syllabus, create a daily or weekly study schedule, assigning time for each subject and topic. Stick to the schedule as faithfully as possible and keep track of your progress.

4. Strengthen your basics: Focus on strengthening your fundamentals in each subject. Make sure to go through core concepts, definitions, and theorems, as GATE questions often test these aspects. In case of doubts, consult reliable sources or seek help from teachers and peers.

5. Practice problems: Solve a variety of problems from each topic, including previous years' GATE questions and problems from recommended books. This will help you develop a better understanding of the concepts and improve your problem-solving ability.

6. Test series and mock examinations: Join a reputed test series or attempt mock examinations in a timed environment. This will give you an idea of the actual examination process, help you improve your time management, and familiarize you with the online interface used in the GATE exam.

7. Analyze performance: After taking mock tests or solving practice problems, analyze your weaker and stronger areas. Work upon improving areas where you are facing difficulty and allocate more time to those subjects.

8. Revision: Periodically revise the topics you have covered. Make short notes or flashcards to help you with quick revisions. Consistently revising concepts ensures that the topics are fresh in your mind.

9. Stay motivated and positive: Stay focused, motivated, and maintain a positive attitude throughout your GATE preparation. Take breaks, eat healthily, and exercise regularly to stay mentally and physically fit.

In conclusion, although the questions do not have exactly the same meaning, the approach to prepare for the GATE examination remains similar. Analyzing the time constraint and subject, planning, practicing, and being consistent in your efforts are the key takeaways for success.
