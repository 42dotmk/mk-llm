[Question]There are 480 zombies in the shopping mall. If the number of zombies doubled every day, how many days ago were there less than 50 zombies in the mall?
[Answer]First find how many zombies there were one day ago: 480 zombies / 2 = 240 zombies. Then find how many zombies there were two days ago: 240 zombies / 2 = 120 zombies. Then find the number of zombies there were three days ago: 120 zombies / 2 = 60 zombies. Then find the number of zombies there were four days ago: 60 zombies / 2 = 30 zombies, which is less than 50, so there were less than 50 zombies 4 days ago. The answer is 4.
Q: Olaf has an aquarium. He has fish in 3 different colors: orange, green, and blue. Blue fish make up half of all the fish in the aquarium. There are 15 fewer orange fish than blue fish. How many green fish are there when the total number of fish in the aquarium is 80?
A: If there are 80 fish in total, then there are 80 fish / 2 = 40 blue fish. The orange fish count is 15 less than blue, so it's 40 fish - 15 fish = 25 fish. Olaf has then 80 fish - 25 fish - 40 fish = 15 green fish. The answer is 15.

[Question]Granger has five times as many spots as his brother, Cisco. But Cisco has 5 less than half as many spots as his cousin, Rover. If Rover has 46 spots, how many spots do Granger and Cisco have combined?
[Answer]If Rover has 46 spots, then half as many spots as Rover has is 46 / 2 = 23 spots. If Cisco has 5 less than half as many spots as Rover has, then Cisco has 23 - 5 = 18 spots. If Granger has five times as many spots as Cisco, then Rover has 18 * 5 = 90 spots. Thus, the total combined number of spots that Rover and Cisco have is 90 + 18 = 108 spots. The answer is 108.
Q: Phill had some friends over for pizza. He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced. Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again. Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends. How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
A: Phill starts with 1 pizza, cutting it in half. This means he now has 1 * 2 = 2 slices of pizza. He cuts each of these 2 slices in half, meaning he now has 2 * 2 = 4 slices of pizza. He then cuts these in half again, meaning he now has 4 * 2 = 8 slices of pizza. Phill hands out 2 slices to 2 of his friends, meaning he gave out 2 * 2 = 4 slices. He hands out 1 slice to 3 others, so the total amount of slices handed out are 3 + 4 = 7 slices. Since Phill started with 8 slices, this means he has 8 - 7 = 1 slice remaining. The answer is 1.
