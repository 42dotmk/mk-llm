[Question]Bingo has two dogs. On average, they walk a total of 70 miles a week. The first dog walks an average of 2 miles a day. How many miles a day does the other dog average?
[Answer]The first dog walks 14 miles in a week because 7 x 2 = 14. The second dog walks 56 miles in a week because 70 - 14 = 56. The second dog walks an average of 8 miles a day because 56 / 7 = 8. The answer is 8.
Q: A bicycle shop owner adds 3 bikes to her stock every week. After 1 month, she had sold 18 bikes but still had 45 bikes in stock. How many bikes did she have originally?
A: There are approximately 4 weeks in a month. The shop owner added 3 bikes every week for 4 weeks for a total addition of 3 * 4 = 12 bikes. The shop owner now has the original number of bikes + 12 bikes. She sold 18 bikes within the same time frame. She now has a total of 45 bikes which is: the original number of bikes + 12 - 18 = 45 bikes. The original number of bikes = 45 - 12 + 18 = 51 bikes. The answer is 51.
Question: Raj's house has an area equal to 1,110 square feet. It has 4 bedrooms that each measure 11 x 11 feet. There are 2 bathrooms that are 6 x 8 feet each. The kitchen and living area complete the home and they have the same sized area. How many square feet is the area of the kitchen?
Answer: Area of 1 bedroom = 11 * 11 = 121 square feet. Area of 4 bedrooms = 121 * 4 = 484 square feet. Area of 1 bathroom = 6 * 8 = 48 square feet. Area of 2 bathrooms = 2 * 48 = 96 square feet. Area of all bedrooms and bathrooms = 484 + 96 = 580 square feet. Kitchen + living room = 1,110 - 580 = 530. Kitchen = 530 / 2 = 265. The kitchen is 265 square feet. The answer is 265.
[Question]In five years, Rehana will be three times as old as Phoebe. If Rehana is currently 25 years old, and Jacob, Rehana's brother, is 3/5 of Phoebe's current age, how old is Jacob now?
[Answer]If Rehana is currently 25 years old, she will be 25 + 5 = 30 in five years. Rehana will be three times as old as Phoebe in five years, meaning Phoebe will be 30 / 3 = 10 years old in five years. Currently, Phoebe is 10 - 5 = 5 years old. 3 / 5 of Phoebe's age now is 3 / 5 * 5 = 3 years, which is Jacob's age. The answer is 3.
Q: Marites internet speed is 10 megabits per second and her monthly internet bill is $20. Marites is planning to upgrade her service and choosing between 20 Mbps and 30 Mbps. If the price of the 30 Mbps is twice the amount of her current monthly bill and the price of the 20 Mbps is $10 more than her current monthly bill, how much will she save per year if she chooses the 20 Mbps than 30 Mbps?
A: The total monthly bill for 30 Mbps is $20 x 2 = $40. She will have to pay $40 x 12 = $480 every year for 30mbps. The total monthly bill for 20 Mbps is $20 + $10 = $30. So, she will have to pay $30 x 12 = $360 for 20 Mbps per year. Therefore the amount she will save per year if she chooses the 20mbps is $480 - $360 = $120. The answer is 120.
