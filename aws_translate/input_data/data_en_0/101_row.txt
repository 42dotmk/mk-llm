Q: John decided to buy 10 pins for himself. They are normally $20 each but they were on sale for 15% off. How much did he spend on pins?
A: The sell reduced the price of each pin by 20 * .15 = $3. So he paid 20 - 3 = $17 per pin. So the total cost was 17 * 10 = $170. The answer is 170.
Question: Mr Fletcher hired 2 men to dig a well in his compound. They worked for 10 hours on the first day, 8 hours on the second day and finished the job on the third day after working 15 hours. If Mr Fletcher paid each of them $10 per hour of work, calculate the total amount of money they received altogether?
Answer: The total number of hours each worker works in the first 2 days is 10 + 8 = 18 hours. Since they completed the job in three days, each was compensated for 18 + 15 = 33 hours of work. Mr Fletcher paid each of the workers $10 per hour of work, meaning for 33 hours, each of the workers received 33 * $10 = $330. Since they were two workers, the total amount they received all together after each was paid $330 is $330 * 2 = $660. The answer is 660.
[Question]Marla has a grid of squares that has 10 rows and 15 squares in each row. She colors 4 rows of 6 squares in the middle of the grid with red. She colors all squares on the first 2 and last 2 rows with blue. Then she colors the rest with green. How many squares does Marla color green?
[Answer]There are 10 x 15 = 150 squares in a grid. 4 x 6 = 24 squares are colored red. There are 2 + 2 = 4 rows that are all blue. Thus, a total of 4 x 15 = 60 squares are colored blue. 24 + 60 = 84 squares are color red or blue. Therefore, 150 - 84 = 66 square are green. The answer is 66.
Q: In her first term, Governor Sandoval gave twice as many commencement addresses as Governor Hawkins. Governor Sloan gave ten more commencement addresses than Governor Sandoval in the same amount of time. If Governor Sandoval gave 12 commencement addresses, how many commencement addresses did the three of them give altogether?
A: Since Governor Sandoval gave 12 commencement addresses, twice the number that Governor Hawkins gave, Governor Hawkins gave 12 / 2 = 6 commencement addresses. The two of them gave 6 + 12 = 18 commencement addresses in total. Governor Sloan gave ten more commencement addresses than Governor Sandoval, a total of 12 + 10 = 22 commencement addresses. The three of them gave 22 + 18 = 40 commencement addresses. The answer is 40.
Question: In a card game, you are awarded 10 points if you win one round. While playing, Jane ends up with 60 points. If she lost 20 points, then how many rounds did she play?
