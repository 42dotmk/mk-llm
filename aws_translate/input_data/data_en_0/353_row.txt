Plot Outline:
Roger Thompson, a 35-year-old real estate agent, finds solace in maintaining a golden tan at his local tanning salon. An unexpected tragedy strikes when he's involved in a freak sunbed accident that causes severe burns over a significant portion of his body. 

Act 1:
Roger Thompson is seen as a charming and ambitious real estate agent who has built a successful career in a small suburban town. He has a friendly demeanor, with a healthy obsession with looking good to maintain his image. After a long day of work, he goes to the local tanning salon, planning to relax on the sunbed for a while. Roger is well-known to the salon staff, and as he enters, warmly greets everyone.

Act 2:
During his tanning session, Roger somehow gets trapped inside the sunbed, with the temperature slowly rising to dangerous levels. Screaming for help, he struggles to push open the sunbed's lid, but it doesn't budge. Miraculously, the owner of the salon overhears Roger's cries for help and rushes in to set him free. He's severely burned, and immediately taken to the hospital.

Act 3:
As Roger recovers in the hospital, the incident sparks an investigation into whether the sunbed malfunction was a tragic accident or a malicious attempt on Roger's life. This leads to two detectives, Detective Johnson and Detective Ramirez, partnering up to unravel the mystery. As they delve deeper into the case, they uncover several dark secrets about the people in Roger's life, including some jealous co-workers and a bitter ex-girlfriend.

Act 4:
Each significant character in Roger's life is revealed to have varying motives for wanting him harmed, making the case more complicated. The detectives employ Roger's help to set up a trap for the potential perpetrator. Roger fakes his discharge from the hospital and resumes his work, exposing himself as vulnerable and unprotected. 

Act 5:
As the story unfolds, it is discovered that the salon's staff member, Mindy, is secretly in love with Roger but has been repeatedly rejected by him due to her shyness. She deliberately tampered with the sunbed to hurt Roger, hoping to gain his attention and appreciation by subsequently rescuing him. But, the plan went wrong when the owner arrived first and rescued him instead. Mindy confesses everything to Detective Johnson and Ramirez, and Roger realizes that he was blind to the romantic interest so close to him. Mindy's obsession led her to act recklessly, ultimately causing damage to Roger's life and her own.

Roger, now emotionally and physically scarred from the experience, resolves to start a new chapter in his life. As he goes through a period of rehabilitation and long introspection, Roger learns to appreciate the simpler things in life and the value of genuine relationships. Mindy undergoes psychiatric treatment to address her misguided obsession with Roger, hoping to atone for her actions. The story ends on a bittersweet note, with Roger and Mindy both working towards a better future, while the events of the past remain etched in their memories.
