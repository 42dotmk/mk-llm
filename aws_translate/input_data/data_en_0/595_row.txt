To construct an argument in favor of a two-state solution being better justified than a one-state solution in the conflict between Israel and Palestine, one could follow these steps:

Step 1: Establish the context and goal
The Israel-Palestine conflict has persisted for decades, with both sides laying claim to the same territories. A peaceful resolution is both morally and practically necessary. The main goal of this argument is to demonstrate that the two-state solution is more justified than a one-state solution.

Step 2: Define the terms
A two-state solution would create separate, sovereign nations for both Israelis and Palestinians, living side by side in peace. A one-state solution would merge both populations into a single, binational state.

Step 3: Highlight the main issues
Three critical issues are often raised in this debate: the rights of both parties to self-determination, achieving a territorial compromise, and guaranteeing the security of both populations.

Step 4: Address the issues from the perspective of a two-state solution
1. Self-determination: A two-state solution respects the right of self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians. It acknowledges their distinct national identities and allows them to govern themselves independently, promoting peaceful coexistence and reducing tensions between the two groups.

2. Territorial compromise: A two-state solution would require both sides to make territorial compromises, such as re-drawing existing borders to create a viable Palestinian state. By doing so, both parties can reach a compromise that satisfies their respective national aspirations, making it more likely to be accepted by both populations.

3. Security: Separate states would provide better security guarantees to both Israelis and Palestinians. Israel could maintain its defense capabilities within its borders, safeguarding its population against external threats, while a sovereign Palestinian state could work with the international community on security issues, ensuring that its interests are protected.

Step 5: Counter-argue any potential benefits of a one-state solution
Critics of a two-state solution often argue that a one-state solution would be more democratic and fair, eliminating the barrier between Israelis and Palestinians. However, given the vast differences in culture, religion, and national identity, a one-state solution could exacerbate tensions and lead to more conflict. The two-state solution respects these differences by allowing each group to govern themselves, leading to better chances for peaceful relations.

Step 6: Conclude the argument
In conclusion, a two-state solution provides a more justified approach to resolving the Israel-Palestine conflict. By respecting the rights of self-determination, enabling territorial compromises, and ensuring security for both populations, it lays the groundwork for a more peaceful and stable future for Israelis and Palestinians. While a one-state solution may seem ideal in theory, its implementation could potentially worsen the situation rather than promote harmony between the two groups.
