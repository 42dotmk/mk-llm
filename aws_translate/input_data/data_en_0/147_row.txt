Hydrophobia, marked by a violent fear of water, is commonly known as rabies. Rabies is a deadly viral disease that affects the central nervous system of mammals, including humans, and is transmitted primarily through the bite of an infected animal, usually a wild one. The term "hydrophobia" originates from one of the most characteristic symptoms of rabies in its advanced stage â€“ the intense fear of water or difficulty in swallowing, which occurs due to the virus affecting the person's throat muscles and causing severe pain upon attempting to swallow.

The rabies virus is typically present in the saliva of infected animals and enters the victim's body when bitten or scratched. It can also be transmitted when an infected animal's saliva comes in contact with an open wound or mucous membranes, such as the eyes, mouth, or nose. Once inside the body, the virus travels through peripheral nerves to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), where it multiplies and causes inflammation, eventually spreading to other organs, including the salivary glands.

The incubation period of rabies can range from a few weeks to several months, during which an individual exhibits no symptoms. However, once symptoms appear, the disease progresses rapidly and is almost always fatal if left untreated. Early symptoms of rabies may include fever, headache, malaise, and a general feeling of discomfort. As the disease progresses, more specific neurological symptoms appear, like agitation, anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, muscle weakness, paralysis, and the aforementioned swallowing difficulties and fear of water.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that around 59,000 people die from rabies each year, with more than 95% of these fatalities occurring in Africa and Asia. Dogs are the primary source of human rabies infection globally, contributing to over 99% of all cases. Prevention of rabies in domestic animals, therefore, is critical in minimizing human infection rates. Vaccinating pets and monitoring contact with wild animals are essential components of rabies prevention, as is seeking immediate medical attention for potential exposure to the virus.

Although rabies is almost invariably fatal once symptoms appear, it can be prevented through timely post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). PEP involves administering a series of rabies vaccines, and in some cases, human rabies immune globulin, to individuals who have been exposed to the virus. The treatment is most effective when given soon after exposure, so seeking medical attention immediately after a potential rabies exposure is crucial.

In conclusion, hydrophobia is a common name for rabies, a deadly viral disease characterized by a violent fear of water and difficulty swallowing due to infected throat muscles. Rabies is primarily transmitted through the bite or scratch of an infected animal and affects the victim's central nervous system. It is crucial to vaccinate pets, avoid contact with wild animals, and promptly seek medical attention after potential rabies exposure for effective prevention and treatment.
