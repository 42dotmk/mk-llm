While "physical weathering" partially contributes to the formation of canyons, it may not be the most accurate answer to the question "what are most canyons caused by?" given that most canyons are indeed formed by flowing water, specifically through the continuous and long-term action of erosion. Erosion refers to the process where the natural elements wear away at the earth's surface, and it mainly involves water, wind, and ice. In the case of canyons, water is the leading agent.

To provide more context, let's explore the intricate process of canyon formation, which typically involves a combination of erosion, weathering, and other geological processes.

1. Erosion by flowing water: As water flows through a river or a stream, it carries sediments and rock particles with it. Over time, this moving water erodes the landscape, cutting deeper into the earth's surface. The erosional force exerted by the water becomes stronger as the volume and speed of the water increase, which is why canyons are commonly found in arid regions with occasional flash floods that rapidly concentrate large volumes of water within narrow channels.

2. Physical weathering: While the primary force behind canyon formation is erosion, physical weathering plays a supporting role. Physical weathering, also known as mechanical weathering, involves the breakdown of rocks and minerals through processes such as freeze-thaw cycles, thermal expansion and contraction, and abrasion. These processes can weaken the rock formations, making it easier for the erosional force of water to remove and transport sediments.

3. Chemical weathering: In addition to physical weathering, chemical weathering also contributes to canyon formation. Chemical weathering occurs when the minerals within rocks react with water, air, and other chemicals, leading to the alteration or dissolution of the rock. This process further weakens the rock formations, facilitating their removal by flowing water.

4. Tectonic activity: In some cases, geological processes such as the movement of tectonic plates can contribute to canyon formation. Uplift of the earth's crust can create steep river gradients, encouraging rapid stream erosion. In other cases, faulting can lead to stream capture and the formation of deep, narrow canyons along fault lines.

5. Differential erosion: Canyons typically develop in areas where the rock layers have varying degrees of resistance to erosion. Water will erode softer, less resistant rocks more quickly than harder, more resistant rocks. This results in a continuous deepening and widening process that ultimately leads to the formation of a canyon.

In conclusion, although physical weathering does play a part in the formation of canyons, it is not the main cause. The most accurate answer to the question "what are most canyons caused by?" would be the action of flowing water via erosion. This dominant process, along with other contributing factors such as physical and chemical weathering as well as tectonic activity, work together to create the breathtaking canyons that we witness in various parts of the world today.
