Title: Major Changes in Timeline of Las Vegas Shooting Unveiled by Clark County Sheriff

Introduction

On October 1, 2017, America was shaken by the deadliest mass shooting in its modern history. The assailant, Stephen Paddock, opened fire at a crowd in the Route 91 Harvest music festival near the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Resort in Las Vegas, leaving at least 58 dead and hundreds injured. As the investigation continues, new information surfaces, altering our understanding of the event. This article will delve into the major changes in the timeline of the Las Vegas shooting incident, based on the statements of the Clark County Sheriff, Joe Lombardo.

The chronological change and its implications

The most significant change in the course of events involves the hotel security guard, Jesus Campos, injured by Paddock. Previously, it was believed that Paddock ceased fire on the festival crowd following Campos' arrival on the assailant's floor. However, Sheriff Joe Lombardo now says Campos was shot before Paddock began firing at the festival crowd.

According to Lombardo, Campos was investigating a report of an open door on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel when he heard drilling sounds coming from Paddock's room. Upon realizing that Campos was approaching, Paddock opened fire into the hallway, hitting Campos in the leg. Despite being injured, Campos alerted security officials to the shooter's location. The sheriff added that Paddock started firing on the crowd about six minutes after shooting Campos. Paddock never completed his drilling, which may have been meant to install additional cameras or provide access for more gunfire.

This change in the timeline raises new questions about law enforcement's response to the incident and the subsequent investigation. The sheriff did not provide an explanation for why this alteration was made to the timeline and did not comment on its effects on the ongoing investigation, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Sheriff Lombardo said, "In your zest for information and my zest to ensure the public safety and the calming of their minds, some things are going to change."

Paddock's surveillance efforts and motive

Sheriff Lombardo disclosed that Paddock had installed hidden cameras in the hotel room, suggesting he carefully planned and prepared for the attack. These cameras may have helped Paddock watch for approaching security threats, such as Campos. As of now, law enforcement officials have not been able to identify Paddock's motive for the shooting.

Conclusion

As the investigation into the Las Vegas shooting continues, new revelations like the ones from Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo will alter our perception of the horrific event. With many questions still unanswered, including the motive and law enforcement's response, the public eagerly awaits further information to piece together the complete picture of the fateful night. It is important to remember, however, that the investigation process may be fluid and susceptible to changes in an attempt to establish a thorough understanding of the events that transpired.
