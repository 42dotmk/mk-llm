Reasoning and answer: One less than 5 is 5 - 1 = 4. If one tarantula egg sac can contain 1000 tarantulas, then four egg sacs can hold 4 * 1000 = 4000 tarantula babies. If each tarantula baby has eight legs, the 4 egg sacs can contain 4000 * 8 = 32,000 baby tarantula legs.
The answer: 32000

Let S be the number of systems Rodney sold on the first street. He sold 2S systems on the second street. Based on his commission, he sold 175 / 25 = 7 systems. In all, he sold S + 2S + 0 + 1 = 3S + 1 = 7 systems. On the first and second streets, he sold 3S = 7 - 1 = 6 systems. Thus, on the first street he sold S = 6 / 3 = 2 systems. On the second street, Rodney sold 2 * 2 = 4 security systems.
The answer: 4
Reverse engineering the question: Rodney is a door-to-door salesman trying to sell home security systems. He gets a commission of $25 for each system he sells. He is canvassing a neighborhood of four streets with eight houses each. The first street gave him half the sales that the second street did, while every house on the third street turned him away and the fourth street resulted in only one sale. His total commission was $175. How many security systems did he sell on the second street?

Reasoning and answer: First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20 + 5 = 25 per meal. Then we multiply this by 2, as there are two people eating, meaning a total cost of 25 * 2 = 50 for both meals. Then we find the total tip amount for a 20% tip, by multiplying 50 * .2 = 10. Then we find out what 80% of this tip amount is by multiplying the desired tip of 10 by .8, finding 10 * .8 = 8 dollars that Billy should contribute.
The answer: 8
