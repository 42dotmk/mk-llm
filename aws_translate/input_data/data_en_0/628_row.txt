[Question]Roxy has 7 flowering plants in her garden. She has twice as many fruiting plants as her flowering plants. On Saturday, she goes to the nursery and buys 3 flowering plants and 2 fruiting plants. On Sunday, she gives away 1 flowering plant and 4 fruiting plants to her neighbor, Ronny.  How many plants are remaining in her garden?
[Answer]Roxy’s flowering plant count is 7. Her fruiting plant count is 7 x 2 = 14. On Saturday, her flowering plant count is 7 + 3 = 10. On Saturday, her fruiting plant count is 14 + 2 = 16. On Sunday, her flowering plant count is 10 - 1 = 9. On Sunday, her fruiting plant count is 16 - 4 = 12. Roxy’s remaining plant count in her garden is 9 + 12 = 21. The answer is 21.
Q: Amanda is figuring out how many bags of grass seed she needs to buy to cover a new lot the city is turning into a park. The lot measures 120 feet by 60 feet. One section that measures 40 feet by 40 feet will be covered with concrete, and the rest needs to be covered in grass seeds. Each bag of grass seeds covers 56 square feet. How many bags of grass seeds does Amanda need?
A: First find the area of the lot by multiplying the width and the length: 120 ft * 60 ft = 7200 sq ft. Then find the area of the square covered in concrete: 40 ft * 40 ft = 1600 sq ft. Then subtract the concrete area from the total area to find the grassy area: 7200 sq ft - 1600 sq ft = 5600 sq ft. Finally, divide this area by the area each bag covers to find the number of bags: 5600 sq ft / 56 sq ft / bag = 100 bags. The answer is 100.
Question: Lauren sent 65 pieces of mail on Monday, 10 more pieces of mail on Tuesday than on Monday, 5 fewer on Wednesday than on Tuesday, and 15 more pieces of mail on Thursday than on Wednesday. How many pieces of mail did Lauren send?
Answer: Lauren sent 65 + 10 = 75 pieces of mail on Tuesday. He sent 75 - 5 = 70 pieces of mail on Wednesday. And sent 70 + 15 = 85 pieces of mail on Thursday. Therefore, he sent 65 + 75 + 70 + 85 = 295 pieces of mail. The answer is 295.
[Question]There are three buckets of seeds labeled A, B, and C with 100 seeds. There are ten more seeds in bucket A than in bucket B, and bucket B has 30 seeds. How many seeds are in bucket C?
[Answer]Bucket A has 10 more seeds than bucket B: so there are 10 seeds + 30 seeds = 40 seeds in bucket A. Bucket A and bucket B have 40 seeds + 30 seeds = 70 seeds together. If there are 100 seeds in all the buckets, then bucket C has 100 seeds - 70 seeds = 30 seeds. The answer is 30.
