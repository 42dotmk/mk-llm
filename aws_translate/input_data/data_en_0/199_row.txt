Creating a wellness plan begins by assessing your current physical state. This involves looking at several aspects including nutrition, physical fitness, and medical wellness. 

A. Nutrition Wellness: This means evaluating your eating habits to understand whether or not you are feeding your body with the right amount and types of nutrients. Here are some suggestions for how you might conduct your nutrition wellness assessment:

1. Keep a food diary: By writing down what you eat and drink for a week, you can identify patterns in your eating habits. From these patterns, you can recognize what types of foods you may be overeating or under-eating, at what times, and under what circumstances (like stress).

2. Analyze your food diary: Look for ways to replace unhealthy foods with healthier alternatives. For example, swap out processed foods with whole foods, and sugary drinks with water or herbal teas. 

3. Consult with a registered dietitian or nutritionist: Nutrition can be complex, and what works for one person may not work for another, so getting advice from an expert can help you to create a more tailored and effective nutrition plan.

B. Physical Fitness: This refers to your exercise habits. Here are some ways to assess your current state:

1. Check your exercise frequency: As a guideline, it's recommended that adults have at least 150 minutes of moderate activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week.

2. Assess your exercise intensity: This depends on your fitness goals. If you want to lose weight, you may need higher-intensity workouts, whereas if you're new to exercise, you might start with low-intensity activities.

3. Get a fitness evaluation: A certified trainer can measure your strength, flexibility, and endurance to help provide a more comprehensive understanding of your physical fitness.

C. Medical Wellness: This refers to managing chronic conditions and staying updated with preventive screenings and vaccines. Here's how you might evaluate your medical wellness:

1. Regular Check-ups: Having regular medical, dental, and eye check-ups can help ensure that your body is in good condition and any potential issues are spotted early.

2. Know your family history: It's important to be aware of any health conditions that run in your family, and to get appropriate screenings and preventative measures if needed.

3. Mental Health: This is equally as important as physical health. Excessive stress or feelings of depression can have serious impacts on overall health, so it's important to also seek professional help if you are feeling psychologically or emotionally unwell.

Once you've assessed these elements, the next step in your wellness plan would be setting realistic and achievable goals. It's important to remember that change doesn't happen overnight but comes with consistent habits. Keep track of your progress, acknowledge your achievements along the way, and adjust your wellness plan as needed. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself if you fall off track occasionally; what's important is picking back up and continuing your wellness journey.
