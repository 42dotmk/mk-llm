[Question]Gary bought his first used car for $6,000. Gary borrowed the money from his dad who said he could pay him back the full amount over 5 years. Gary decided he would pay his dad back the full amount in 2 years. How much more is Gary spending per month to pay the loan off in 2 years instead of 5?
[Answer]A full year has 12 months. So 2 years is 2 * 12 = 24 months. The loan amount is $6,000 that he will repay in 24 months so 6000 / 24 = $250 per month. If he paid his dad back in 5 years that 5 * 12 = 60 months. $6,000 loan spread out over 60 months is 6000 / 60 = $100 per month. To pay it off in 2 years instead of 5, Gary is paying 250 - 100 = $150 more per month. The answer is 150.
Q: James needs 200 blueberries to make a pint of blueberry jam and then a quart of blueberry jam to make a blueberry pie. If there are two pints per quart, how many blueberries does James need to pick to make 6 pies?
A: First find the total number of blueberries needed for one pie: 200 blueberries / pint * 2 pints / pie = 400 blueberries / pie. Then multiply that number by the number of pie to find the total number of blueberries James need: 400 blueberries / pie * 6 pies = 2400 blueberries. The answer is 2400.
Question: Archie needs to lay sod in his backyard that measures 20 yards by 13 yards. He has a shed on it that measures 3 yards by 5 yards. How many square yards of sod will Archie need for his backyard?
Answer: 20 * 13 = 260 square yards. 3 * 5 = 15 square yards. 260 - 15 = 245 square yards. Archie needs 245 square yards of sod. The answer is 245.
[Question]To eat to when she gets full, Michaela needs 20 oranges. Cassandra needs twice as many oranges as Michaela to eat until she gets full. If they picked 90 oranges from the farm today, how many oranges would remain after they've both eaten until they were full?
[Answer]Since Michaela needs 20 oranges to eat to her full, and Cassandra eats twice as much to have her full, Cassandra needs 2 * 20 = 40 oranges to eat. They eat 20 + 40 = 60 oranges together to have their fill. If they picked 90 oranges today, after eating 60 together, 90 - 60 = 30 oranges would remain. The answer is 30.
Q: A mother duck as 8 ducklings. The first 3 ducklings find 5 snails each. Another 3 ducklings find 9 snails each, and the remaining ducklings each find half the number of snails that mother duck finds. If mother duck finds tree times the total number of snails as the first 2 groups of ducklings, how many snails does the family of ducks have collectively?
A: The first 3 ducklings find 3 x 5 = 15 snails. The next 3 ducklings find 3 x 9 = 27 snails. They find a total of 15 + 27 = 42 snails. Mother duck finds 42 x 3 = 126 snails. The last group has 8 - 3 - 3 = 2 ducklings. They find 126 / 2 = 63 snails each. The family of ducks found a total of 42 + 126 + 63 + 63 = 294 snails. The answer is 294.
