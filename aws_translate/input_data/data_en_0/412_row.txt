While it might be tempting to conclude that "The Cete was extended westward over a century ago" based on the given information, there is insufficient evidence to support this claim. The statement provides an insight into the recent history of the tourist industry in the Cete region, mentioning that in recent years it has expanded westward. However, no specific timeline is provided to determine if this expansion happened precisely a century ago. 

To better understand the situation, let's analyze the different aspects of the statement, starting by defining the key terms and discussing the growth and development of the tourist industry in the Cete region.

1. The Cete: Traditionally, the Cete has been a popular coastal region located in the south of France, known for its stunning beaches, picturesque towns, and luxury tourism industry. It is often referred to as the French Riviera, or Côte d'Azur in French.

2. Saint-Raphaël, Sainte-Maxime, and Saint-Tropez: These are three coastal towns situated along the Mediterranean coast of the French Riviera. Saint-Raphaël and Sainte-Maxime are widely recognized for their family-friendly atmosphere, while Saint-Tropez is renowned for its glamour, attracting numerous celebrities, artists, and wealthy travelers.

3. Tourist industry expansion: The statement suggests that recent years have brought about changes in the tourist industry in the Cete region, with more focus given to the western part of the area. This shift has allowed popular resorts like Saint-Raphaël, Sainte-Maxime, and Saint-Tropez to flourish, showcasing the diversity that the French Riviera can offer to travelers.

Based on this information, it is clear that there has been a westward expansion of the tourist industry in the Cete region. However, it is important to note that the statement refers to this expansion as a recent event, which indicates that it has occurred within the past few decades, rather than precisely a century ago. Without additional information regarding the exact timeline of this development, we cannot definitively conclude that the Cete was extended westward over a century ago.

Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the tourist industry along the French Riviera has evolved over time. While the region was initially known for its lavish resorts targeting the wealthy, it has made an effort to adapt to the changing demands of travelers, and now offers a wider variety of accommodations and experiences catering to various preferences and budgets. The inclusion of Saint-Raphaël, Sainte-Maxime, and Saint-Tropez as part of the larger Cete region exemplifies this trend.

In conclusion, although the tourist industry in the Cete region has indeed expanded westward to include popular family-style resorts like Saint-Raphaël and Sainte-Maxime, and the glamorous Saint-Tropez, there is not enough information to support the claim that this extension took place over a century ago. A further exploration of the history of the French Riviera's tourist industry, along with a clear timeline of its development, would be necessary to draw a more accurate conclusion.
