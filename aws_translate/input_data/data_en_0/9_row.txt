My GF's brother is hard pressed at the moment, his car has broken down and needs to be sent to a shop to be repaired.

&amp;#x200B;

We have 3 cars at home, 2 of them being mine. (I don't really need 2 cars, the 2nd one is a manual I'm trying to learn and practice on.)

We agreed to let him borrow the manual car for 1 week, whilst he sorts out a temporary car for himself. 

&amp;#x200B;

A week goes by and he says that his insurance is wasting his time, hasn't sorted him a car and hasn't processed his request correctly. 

He asks to borrow the car and use it for another week. Didn't really want to, but agreed. 

&amp;#x200B;

So it reaches Sunday morning of the 2nd week, and I ask my GF to ask him when he was going to return it? 

He says **"1-2PM"**. 

(Keep in mind, I am asking her to follow it up as I don't really talk to her brother much, and I'm really only doing this whole thing as a favour to her, not him)

Anyway, 2PM goes by and my car isn't returned.

I ask her where it is, she says **"he's been busy and said he'll return it tonight"**. Bit annoying, but ok, that's fine.

At around 8PM, Car's still nowhere to be found. 

I ask her to follow it up and txt him, she says **"he's having dinner and will return it after"**. Slightly irked at how late it is already, I just say **"urgh, ok"**.

&amp;#x200B;

10PM goes by and my car isn't there still. I ask her nicely to call him and find out where it is. She ignores me and carries on watching her TV show. 

2 Mins later I go back into the room and asks if shes called him, she says **"no,he said he'll return it soon"**. Irritated, I ask her **"do you see the time?! It's 10PM!**" She just sits there and laughs and tells me to **"chill out!"**

&amp;#x200B;

This pushes me to the edge and I start raising my voice. I go off and ask her **"why do I have to keep following up about my OWN CAR?!"** . 

Is it not common courtesy to return a car at a reasonable time? Do I have to explicitly state a time for my own car to be returned? I got so heated that I slept in the guest bedroom as I can't believe I'm being made out to be the bad guy for asking about my own car.

&amp;#x200B;

About 5 mins later, the car returns and she says sarcastically **"Your precious car has returned!"**. 

This pisses me off even more and I just ignore her for the rest of the night. 

&amp;#x200B;

AITA? I thought it was common courtesy to return a borrowed car at a reasonable time, without having to explicitly state it has to be returned before 10PM...

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - GF's brother borrowed my car. Extended a 1 week borrow to 2 weeks. Car was returned super late which pissed me off and escalated into an argument and me sleeping in the guest bedroom.
