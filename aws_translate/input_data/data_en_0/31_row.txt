While the statement "Because its molecules contain only carbon and hydrogen atoms, benzene is classed as a hydrocarbon" is an accurate description of the chemical composition of benzene, it does not necessarily address the primary question about its uses. Instead, let me provide a detailed and long answer to the question "What is benzene used for?".

Benzene (C6H6) is an aromatic hydrocarbon with a hexagonal ring structure composed of carbon atoms, each of which is bonded to a single hydrogen atom. It has a variety of industrial, commercial, and scientific applications, and its significance is attributed to its unique chemical properties, which include high stability, strong reactivity, and solubility in organic solvents.

Here are some of the primary uses for benzene:

1. Production of intermediates in the synthesis of other chemicals:
    One of the most important uses of benzene is as a building block for the production of several industrial chemicals. Some examples of these chemicals include:
    a. Ethylbenzene: This is used to make styrene, which is a key component in the production of polystyrene (a common plastic material).
    b. Cumene: This substance is used to produce phenol and acetone, both of which have numerous industrial applications.
    c. Cyclohexane: This is an essential ingredient in the production of nylon, a widely-used synthetic material.
    d. Nitrobenzene: An intermediate in the production of aniline, which is used in the synthesis of dyes, rubber chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.

2. Solvent:
    Benzene is a highly effective solvent for many organic compounds, allowing it to dissolve fats, oils, waxes, resins, and other materials. It is used in the manufacturing of paints, adhesives, rubber, and lubricants. However, due to its toxic nature, benzene is being replaced in many applications by less hazardous solvents such as toluene and xylene.

3. Laboratory applications:
   In addition to its industrial uses, benzene is used in scientific research and laboratory applications. It is used as a reference and calibration substance for various analytical techniques, such as gas chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, due to its well-known molecular structure and solubility.

4. Fuel component:
   Benzene can be found as a trace component in petrol (gasoline) and is a natural part of crude oil. While it has been largely phased out from gasoline formulations in many countries due to its toxic and carcinogenic properties, it may still be present in small amounts.

It is important to note that the uses of benzene have been restricted in recent years due to its hazardous nature. Benzene is classified as a carcinogen, and exposure to high levels of benzene can cause serious health effects, such as respiratory problems, blood disorders, and an increased risk of cancer. As a result, many countries have implemented strict guidelines and regulations to limit benzene exposure in industrial and consumer products, and numerous efforts have been made to find safer alternatives to benzene in various applications.
