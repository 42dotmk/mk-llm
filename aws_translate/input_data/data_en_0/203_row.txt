Hillary Clinton's overwhelming lead in the new CNN/ORC International poll indicates that she is the most likely candidate for the Democratic nomination for the 2016 presidential election. With a significant number of registered Democrats in Iowa expressing their support for her candidacy, it is expected that this trend will continue in other key states as well.

On the other hand, the poll shows that potential Democratic rivals Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders lag far behind in terms of voter preference in Iowa. It is imperative for these candidates to increase their efforts in terms of campaigning and gaining support from not only Iowa voters but also Democratic voters in other primaries and caucuses.

The Harkin Steak Fry will provide Clinton with a high-profile platform to connect with Iowa Democrats and potentially solidify her position as the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. This event, which has been hosted annually by Sen. Tom Harkin since 1972, is an ideal stage for aspiring presidential contenders to showcase their vision and policies to the local electorate. Biden, who is slated to visit the state to attend a liberal Catholic event in Des Moines, also has the opportunity to strengthen his base and demonstrate his commitment to progressive values.

As the 2016 election campaign season begins garnering more attention, it is essential for Clinton and her rivals to emphasize their individual stances on key political issues, build momentum and engage with voters. They will need to address concerns such as the economy, healthcare, foreign policy, national security, climate change, and social justice. In doing so, they can showcase their leadership capabilities and the potential to guide the nation towards progress.

Moving forward, the Democratic candidates will focus on developing grassroots support, refining their messaging, and preparing for the upcoming primary season. They will attempt to differentiate themselves by leveraging their unique experiences, plans, and objectives. It is likely that they will seek endorsements from various political figures, organizations, and unions, which will enhance their credibility and further expand their support base.

The race for the Democratic nomination is far from over, but at this stage, Hillary Clinton appears to be the frontrunner in Iowa and is expected to do well in other states. However, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders will continue to work diligently to gain support from voters across the country.

In conclusion, the most logical completion of this news story is that Hillary Clinton's lead in the polls indicates her strong position within the Democratic party, making her a favorite for the presidential nomination. However, competitors like Biden, Warren, and Sanders will strive to gain support from the electorate and challenge her in the upcoming caucuses and primaries. As the race progresses, it will be important for all candidates to effectively communicate their vision and policy stances in order to gain the trust and support of the Democratic electorate.
