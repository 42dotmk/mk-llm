If each sandwich comes with 4 strips of pepper, and each pepper makes 8 slices, then each sandwich uses 4 / 8 = 0.5 pepper. If the Sandwich Shop serves a sandwich every 5 minutes, then per hour the Shop serves 60 / 5 = 12 sandwiches. Thus, per hour, the Shop uses 12 * 0.5 = 6 jalapeno peppers. And in an 8 - hour day, the Sandwich Shop uses 8 * 6 = 48 jalapeno peppers.
The answer: 48

If there were 4000 whales in the sea three years ago, and their number doubled this year, then there are 2 * 4000 = 8000 whales in the sea this year. If the predictions come true, there will be 8000 + 800 = 8800 whales in the water next year.
The answer: 8800
Reverse engineering the question: The total number of whales in the sea this year is double what it was last year. If the World Animals Organization predicts that there will be 800 more whales in the sea next year, and the number of whales in the sea last year was 4000, calculate the total number of whales in the sea next year if the predictions are accurate.
