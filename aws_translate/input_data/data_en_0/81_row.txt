Q: Bethany loved riding horses. She rode 1 hour after school every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. On Tuesday and Thursday, she rode for 30 min and on Saturdays, she could ride for 2 hours. How many hours in total did she ride over a 2 week period?
A: She rode 1 hour every Monday, Wednesday and Friday each week so every week she rode 1 * 3 = 3 hours. She rode 30 min on Tuesday and Thursday each week for a total of 30 * 2 = 60 min or 1 hour. On Mon, Wed & Friday she rode 3 hours, 1 hour total on Tue and Thur and 2 hours on Sat for a total of 3 + 1 + 2 = 6 hours. She rode 6 hours per week for 2 weeks so in total she rode 6 * 2 = 12 hours. The answer is 12.
Question: Mr. Manuel is a campsite manager who's been tasked with checking the number of tents set up in the recreation area. On a particular day, he counted 100 tents in the northernmost part of the campsite and twice that number on the east side of the grounds. The number of tents at the center of the camp was four times the number of tents in the northernmost part of the campsite. If he also counted 200 tents in the southern part of the campsite, what is the total number of tents in the recreation area?
Answer: On the eastern part of the campsite, Mr Manuel counted 2 * 100 = 200 tents. The total number of tents in the eastern and the northern part of the campgrounds is 200 + 100 = 300. There are four times as many tents as the northernmost part in the central part of the campsite, which means there are 4 * 100 = 400 tents in the central part of the camp. The total number of tents in the three parts of the campsite is 400 + 300 = 700. If you add the number of tents Mr. Manuel counted at the southern part of the campsite, you get 700 + 200 = 900 tents on the whole campsite. The answer is 900.

Q: A box has 2 dozen water bottles and half a dozen more apple bottles than water bottles. How many bottles are in the box?
A: Since a dozen has 12 items, the box has 2 dozen water bottles, a total of 2 * 12 = 24 water bottles. The box also has half a dozen more apple bottles than water bottles, meaning there are 1 / 2 * 12 = 6 more apple bottles than water bottles. The total number of apple bottles in the box is 24 + 6 = 30. In the box, there are a total of 30 + 24 = 54 bottles. The answer is 54.
