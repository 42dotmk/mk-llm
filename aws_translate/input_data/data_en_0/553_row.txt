Elizabeth Taylor, the legendary actress and philanthropist, was known not only for her exceptional acting career but also for her tumultuous personal life. Throughout her lifetime, Taylor was married a total of eight times to seven different men. Here is a chronological list of her marriages and the respective spouses:

1. Conrad "Nicky" Hilton (May 6, 1950 – January 29, 1951): Elizabeth Taylor's first husband was hotel heir Conrad "Nicky" Hilton. They got married when Taylor was just 18 years old, and the marriage was characterized by domestic violence and Hilton's alcoholism. The couple divorced after just 8 months.

2. Michael Wilding (February 21, 1952 – January 26, 1957): Taylor's second husband was British actor Michael Wilding. The couple had a significant age difference, with Wilding being 20 years older than Taylor. They had two sons, Michael Howard Wilding and Christopher Edward Wilding. However, the marriage ended as Taylor felt isolated in their suburban life and Wilding grew increasingly insecure about his wife's celebrity status.

3. Mike Todd (February 2, 1957 – March 22, 1958): Elizabeth Taylor's third marriage was to film producer Mike Todd, with whom she had a daughter named Elizabeth Frances "Liza" Todd. Despite their intense relationship, the marriage was cut short when Todd tragically died in a plane crash in 1958.

4. Eddie Fisher (May 12, 1959 – March 6, 1964): Following her husband's death, Taylor married singer Eddie Fisher in a controversial relationship. Fisher, who was married to actress Debbie Reynolds at the time, left his wife and children to be with Taylor. Though they stayed together for five years, Taylor eventually left Fisher for her "Cleopatra" co-star, Richard Burton.

5. Richard Burton (March 15, 1964 – June 26, 1974): Taylor's most famous relationship was with Welsh actor Richard Burton. The couple had a passionate and tumultuous marriage, with both of them being global superstars at the time. They adopted a daughter, Maria Burton, before filing for divorce in 1974 after ten years of marriage.

6. Richard Burton (October 10, 1975 – August 1, 1976): In a surprising turn, Taylor and Burton remarried less than a year after their first divorce. However, the reunion was short-lived, as they divorced once again just nine months later.

7. John Warner (December 4, 1976 – November 7, 1982): Taylor's sixth husband was Republican politician John Warner, who eventually became a U.S. Senator from Virginia. During their marriage, Taylor became a political wife and often campaigned for her husband. The couple divorced after six years.

8. Larry Fortensky (October 6, 1991 – October 31, 1996): Taylor's final marriage was to construction worker Larry Fortensky, whom she met during her stay at the Betty Ford Center. The couple held a lavish wedding ceremony at Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch but divorced five years later.

Elizabeth Taylor passed away at the age of 79 on March 23, 2011, and despite her numerous marriages, she left a remarkable legacy in the world of entertainment and philanthropy, particularly championing the fight against HIV/AIDS.
