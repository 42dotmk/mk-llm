Who Has It Worse? BP or Goldman Sachs?
The nation is transfixed by the pictures of oil spilling into the Gulf of Mexico. Of course, it wasn’t too long ago that the nation’s angst was focused on Goldman Sachs Group and the SEC’s civil suit against the Wall street investment bank. Naturally, the questions arises, who has it worse BP or Goldman?

The company behind one of the largest oil spills in U.S. history or the Wall Street investment firm accused of failing to properly disclose details about a mortgage securities deal?

BP will likely face more harm from the spill than Goldman will from its Abacus deal. Just look at the pictures. For nearly two months, televisions across the world have been running 24-hour web cams showing millions of gallons of crude oil spewing relentlessly in the blue waters of the Gulf of Mexico, killing wildlife and leaving tar bars on white sandy beaches.

This endless reel of environment disaster images may not turn away customers from BP gas pumps (especially if BP keeps its prices lower than competitors), but it certainly hasn’t endeared the company to another important constituent: regulators.

BP is the largest operator of offshore oil rigs in the Gulf, and it will need regulatory approve to keep expanding its business here. The British company had planned 10 new offshore projects in the Gulf this year. Its chances for obtaining those permits now look quite slim. President Obama said Monday he was looking for someones a– to kick over the spill, which pundits have said is now a political test of the presidents toughness.

The last gigantic oil spill  the 1989 grounding of the Exxon Valdez — occurred 21 years ago, under a less environmentally hawkish administration of George H.W. Bush and before environmental issues had gained mainstream political appeal. But in today’s political environment, lawmakers and/or regulators may be more inclined to impose draconian restrictions on BPs future U.S. business.

Then there is the issue of cost. Some estimates have pegged litigation and clean-up costs at $40 billion, which is about three times BP’s annual profit. That is real money, and accounts for more than half of the $74 billion in BP lost markets value since the spill began. By comparison, one estimate has put the cost of a Goldman settlement with the SEC at around $600 million, a mere wrist slap and fraction of the company’s annual earnings.

Of course, Goldman has lost about $12 billion in market value since the SEC charges were announced in mid April. But the investment bank’s stock can retrace those losses if the capital and financial markets improve. Much of Goldmans profits are generated from its trading prowess. That will likely remain strong regardless of the outcome of the SEC case.

To be sure, Goldmans reputation has been tarnished by the Abacus deal  which at its heart accuses the firm of selling a product that it believed was faulty. But that cant compete with the images of oil drenched pelicans and the underwater geyser that keeps spewing and spewing.
