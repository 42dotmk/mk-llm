Based on the premise "What on earth could Poirot be doing in London!," it is difficult to definitively conclude whether the hypothesis "Poirot was supposed to be here" is true or false without more context. However, we can consider a few potential interpretations and implications of the premise that may lend support or contradict the hypothesis.

1. Surprise or confusion about Poirot's presence in London: The exclamation in the phrase implies a sense of surprise or confusion about Poirot being in London. It could suggest that the speaker did not expect Poirot to be in London, thus potentially contradicting the hypothesis that "Poirot was supposed to be here." The speaker may have believed that Poirot's presence in London is unusual or unexpected due to a variety of possible reasons, such as Poirot having previously communicated that he would be elsewhere, or that his professional responsibilities typically do not require him to be in London.

2. Poirot's potential reasons for being in London: The use of the phrase "on earth" suggests that there might be numerous reasons for Poirot to be in London, some of which could support or undermine the hypothesis. Poirot might be in London to solve a mystery, attend a meeting, or visit friends or family. Alternatively, he could be in London purely by coincidence or as a result of miscommunication or an unexpected change of plans. Without information about Poirot's reasons for being in London, it is difficult to assess the truth of the hypothesis.

3. Context about Poirot's character and typical behaviors: Poirot is a fictional detective created by Agatha Christie, well-known for his meticulous and methodical approach to solving mysteries. As a detective, he is often required to travel to different locations depending on the case he is working on. Depending on the storyline, Poirot may or may not be "supposed" to be in London. Understanding the specific timeline and events surrounding Poirot's appearance in London may help determine whether the hypothesis holds true.

4. The speaker's knowledge and perspective: The truth of the hypothesis may also depend on the speaker's own knowledge and perspective about Poirot's schedule, intentions, or obligations. If the speaker has accurate information about Poirot's plans, their surprise or confusion might indicate that Poirot was not supposed to be in London. On the other hand, if the speaker's knowledge is limited or inaccurate, their reaction may not accurately reflect whether Poirot was supposed to be in London or not.

In summary, without additional context, it is not possible to definitively determine the truth of the hypothesis "Poirot was supposed to be here" based on the premise "What on earth could Poirot be doing in London!" There are various potential interpretations and implications of the premise that could either support or contradict the hypothesis. Assessing the truth of the hypothesis would require more information about Poirot's reasons for being in London, the speaker's knowledge and perspective, or other contextual cues from the surrounding narrative.
