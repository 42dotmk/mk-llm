Q: Hank is raising money for the local homeless shelter. Hank makes $100 in a carwash and donates 90% of the proceeds to the local homeless shelter. Hank makes $80 in a bake sale and donates 75% of the proceeds to the local homeless shelter. Then he makes $50 mowing lawns and donates 100% of the proceeds to the local homeless shelter. How much money does Hank donate in total?
A: From the carwash, Hank donates $100 * 0.90 = $90. From the bake sale, Hank donates $80 * 0.75 = $60. From mowing lawns, Hank donates $50 * 1.00 = $50. Hank donates a total of $90 + $60 + $50 = $200. The answer is 200.
Question: Jon's laundry machine can do 5 pounds of laundry at a time. 4 shirts weigh 1 pound and 2 pairs of pants weigh 1 pound. If he needs to wash 20 shirts and 20 pants, how many loads of laundry does he have to do?
Answer: The shirts weigh 20 / 4 = 5 pounds. The pants weigh 20 / 2 = 10 pounds. So he needs to do 10 + 5 = 15 pounds of laundry. So that would take 15 / 5 = 3 loads of laundry. The answer is 3.
[Question]A shoe company sells $4000 worth of shoes every month. If they want to make $60000 in an entire year how many more dollars per month should they make selling shoes?
[Answer]The amount of money they currently make in a year is 12 * 4000 = $48000. The additional amount they need to make is $60000 - $48000 = $12000 per year. So, they should make $12000 / 12 = $1000 more every month. The answer is 1000.
Q: Caleb, Andy and Billy went on a picnic with their father. Billy took 6 candies with him, Caleb took 11 and Andy left with 9. On the way, their father bought a packet of 36 candies. He gave 8 candies to Billy, 11 to Caleb and the rest to Andy. How many more candies does Andy now have than Caleb?
A: Billy took some candies and got more from his father for a total of 6 + 8 = 14 candies. Caleb has a total of 11 + 11 = 22 candies. Their father gave out 8 + 11 = 19 candies from a pack of 36. He gave the rest which is 36 - 19 = 17 candies to Andy. Andy has a total of 9 + 17 = 26 candies. Andy has 26 - 22 = 4 more candies than Caleb. The answer is 4.
