Title: The Conservative Counter to Occupy Wall Street: We Are the 53% 

Introduction

Following the Occupy Wall Street movement's "We Are the 99%" campaign, conservatives have launched a counter-narrative: "We Are the 53%." This grassroots initiative is a direct challenge to the Occupy Wall Street narrative that speaks from the perspective of the 53% of Americans who pay federal income tax. Conceived by Erick Erickson, founder of RedState.org and a CNN correspondent, the blog features messages such as "Suck it up you whiners" and takes pride in paying taxes.

The Emphasis on Taxpaying

One of the most noteworthy aspects of the "We Are the 53%" movement is the pride in paying federal income taxes. This is an unusual message from conservatives, who have traditionally expressed disdain for contributing money to the federal government. However, the founders of the Tumblr blog argue that their focus on tax-paying isn't contradictory. They believe that paying taxes is the responsible thing to do, but this doesn't mean they support high tax rates. The issue of tax rates, they argue, should be separate from the broader discussion surrounding social responsibility.

The Depressing Nature of "We Are the 53%"

Max Read, a contributor at Gawker, has described the 53% initiative as depressing. What makes the movement disheartening, Read writes, is that many of the contributors could just as easily be members of the Occupy Wall Street's "99%." 

Rather than seeing their stories as a call for help, the 53% view their financial struggles as a badge of pride. This mindset prevents people from holding accountable the large banking conglomerates whose reckless and self-serving behavior has caused widespread hardship. Instead, the 53% claim responsibility for their own financial situations and place blame squarely on their own shoulders.

A Complex Narrative: Pride vs. Advocacy

The rise of "We Are the 53%" reveals a complicated conflict within the conservative camp. On one hand, these individuals express pride in their contributions to society by paying taxes and taking responsibility for their lives. They argue that government handouts only serve to undermine individual work ethic and encourage dependency.

On the other side, Occupy Wall Street's 99% movement seeks to expose the massive wealth inequality and corporate greed that has left so many struggling to make ends meet. For the 99%, the blame for their circumstances lies with the powerful financial elite who have exploited the system, rather than on themselves.

Conclusion

The conservative response to Occupy Wall Street in the form of "We Are the 53%" highlights the contrasting narratives and perspectives present in American society today. While both movements are expressions of legitimate concerns, they reflect deeply divided opinions on the nature of individual responsibility and the role of government in ensuring economic fairness. In this polarized climate, it remains to be seen whether these debates will merely serve to reinforce existing divisions or promote greater understanding and productive dialogue.
