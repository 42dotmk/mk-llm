Question: For homework, Juan's teacher asked everyone in the class, to write down the different types of transportation (cars, trucks, bicycles, skateboards etc) they saw on their way home that afternoon. After school, Juan walked home and saw the following: 15 cars, 3 bicycles, 8 pickup trucks and 1 tricycle. How many tires in total were there on the vehicles Juan saw?
Answer: He saw 15 cars and 8 trucks so 15 + 8 = 23 vehicles. Those 23 vehicles have 4 wheels each so 23 * 4 = 92 wheels. Bicycles have 2 wheels each and he saw 3 bikes so 2 * 3 = 6 wheels. Tricycles have 3 wheels each and he saw 1 tricycle so 1 * 3 = 3 wheels. In total, Juan saw 92 + 6 + 3 = 101 wheels. The answer is 101.
[Question]Ted needs to purchase 5 bananas and 10 oranges. If bananas cost $2 each and oranges cost $1.50 each. How much money does Ted need to purchase 5 bananas and 10 oranges?
[Answer]Ted needs 5 bananas and they each cost $2. To purchase the bananas, Ted needs 5 * 2 = 10 dollars. Because Ted needs 10 oranges and they each cost $1.50, Ted needs 10 * 1.5 = 15 dollars to pay for the oranges. All together Ted needs $10 for the bananas and $15 for the oranges, so combined Ted needs 10 + 15 = 25 dollars to purchase all the produce. The answer is 25.
Q: John wants to lose weight. He eats 1800 calories a day and burns 2300 a day. If he needs to burn 4000 calories to lose 1 pound how many days will it take to lose 10 pounds?
A: He burns 2300 - 1800 = 500 calories a day. He needs to burn 4000 * 10 = 40,000 calories to hit his goal. That means it will take him 40,000 / 500 = 80 days. The answer is 80.
Question: An apple tree produced 200 apples in a particular season. The tree made 20% fewer fruits the following season, but the tree fruits production in the second season doubled during the third season. Calculate the total number of fruits the apple tree grew in the three seasons.
Answer: If the tree produced 200 apples in the first season, there were 20 / 100 * 200 = 40 fewer fruits in the second season. The total production from the apple tree in the second season is 200 - 40 = 160. In the two seasons, the apple tree produced 160 + 200 = 360 fruits. The apple tree doubled the number of fruits it produced in the third season, totaling 160 * 2 = 320. In the three seasons, the apple tree produced 320 + 360 = 680 apples. The answer is 680.
[Question]James builds a 20 story building. The first 10 stories are each 12 feet tall each. The remaining floors are each 3 feet taller. How tall is the building?
