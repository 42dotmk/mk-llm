Tennessee's journey to statehood began well before its official admission to the Union on June 1, 1796. The region was initially inhabited by various Native American tribes, and European explorers, settlers, and traders began to make their way to the area in the mid-16th century. By the mid-18th century, the Cherokee and the Chickasaw tribes were the most prominent Native American groups in the region. The first permanent European settlements were established by the English in the 1760s and 1770s.

Tennessee was initially part of North Carolina's western territory, which was known as the "Territory South of the River Ohio." In 1784, a few years after the American Revolutionary War, settlers in eastern Tennessee declared the territory as the "State of Franklin." However, the bid to become an independent state lacked sufficient support and was eventually dissolved in 1789.

In 1790, North Carolina ceded its western territory to the federal government, which then organized it into the Southwest Territory. President George Washington appointed William Blount as the territorial governor, who played a crucial role in preparing the region for statehood. The territory quickly experienced an influx of settlers, and by 1795, it had reached the minimum population requirement of 60,000 to be considered for statehood.

The process of officially becoming a state began with a constitutional convention held in Knoxville in January 1796. The convention represented various regions of the territory and comprised 55 delegates who drafted and adopted Tennessee's first state constitution.

On February 6, 1796, the delegates completed the drafted constitution, which was then submitted to President Washington and Congress for review. The constitution provided for a bicameral legislature, a governor with limited powers, and a judiciary system. On June 1, 1796, President Washington signed a bill admitting Tennessee as the 16th state of the United States.

Tennessee's involvement in the U.S. Civil War came much later in its history. As a southern state with a predominantly agricultural-based economy and a large enslaved population, Tennessee was bound to have divided loyalties during the Civil War. While many citizens supported secession, there were also Unionist pockets, particularly in East Tennessee. Nonetheless, on June 8, 1861, the citizens of Tennessee voted in favor of joining the Confederacy, becoming the last state to do so.

The state experienced heavy wartime devastation and was the site of numerous key battles. Towards the end of the war, on July 24, 1866, Tennessee became the first Confederate state to be readmitted to the Union after meeting the requirements for reconstruction.

In summary, Tennessee became a state through a series of territorial acquisitions, population growth, and constitutional conventions that led to its admission to the Union in 1796. Its relationship with the federal government during the U.S. Civil War marked a tumultuous period in its history, but the state's readmission to the Union in 1866 signified its commitment to move forward and rebuild.
