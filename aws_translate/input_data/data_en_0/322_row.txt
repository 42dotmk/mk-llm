The film opens in a bustling city, where Ray, an influential mafia boss, is known for his brutal tactics. Ray's friend, Marty, a lively accountant, accidentally stumbles onto a secret financial heist plan by Ray and his gang, leading to a conflict between the two.

Marty, naive and idealistic, believes in justice and decides to expose Ray. However, Ray catches wind of his plans and decides Marty is a liability that needs to be dealt with urgently. The news rattles the city's underworld, causing panic among those who once called Marty, essentially a pacifist, their friend.

Ray's power and influence make Marty's life unbearable. Perceiving that his end is near, Marty leaves behind several cryptic clues, hoping his journalist wife, Sarah, would uncover the truth if something happened to him. Unable to escape the city in time, Marty is captured by Ray's henchmen.

Ray, showcasing his brute force and lack of empathy, decides to bury Marty alive as a warning to anyone who dared to cross him in the future. Marty is taken to a remote location and buried under the sand, left with nothing but a walkie-talkie to communicate his final words.

The second act begins with Sarah, embarking on a relentless pursuit to find her missing husband. She deciphers Marty's clues which lead her to Ray's heinous plan.

Daniel, Sarah, and a team of other supporting characters are against the clock to find Marty. They pursue multiple leads, confront Ray's gang members, and go through a rollercoaster of emotions and action-packed chases and fights. Meanwhile, Marty clings to life underneath the sand, communicating through the walkie-talkie with them, providing valuable information about his location.

Ray, upon learning Sarah's intentions, becomes hell-bent on stopping her, leading to a thrilling climax. Sarah, driven by the need to save her husband, and Daniel, powered by his urge to serve justice, stand firm against Ray and his gang.

The ultimate climax leads to a location where a fierce fight ensues between Ray's gang and the rescue team. Daniel fights off the henchmen, while Sarah frantically digs through the sand searching for Marty.

The final moments of the film are nail-biting as breathless Marty's voice fades on the walkie-talkie while Ray and Daniel engage in a final showdown. In the end, Sarah manages to find and dig out Marty, just as Daniel takes down Ray, offering viewers a relief-filled, emotional ending.
