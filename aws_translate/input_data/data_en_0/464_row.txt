Q: Jill spends time every day talking to her boyfriend on the phone. The first day of the week she spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend. Each of the following days she spends twice as much time talking on the phone as the day before. After the 5th day her parents take the phone away from her because she was on it too long. How much time did Jill spend talking to her boyfriend that week?
A: Jill starts off spending 5 minutes on the phone, and the following day she spends double that 5 minutes for 5 * 2 = 10 minutes. The following day Jill spends double the previous day's total of 10 minutes on the phone, for 10 * 2 = 20 minutes. On the fourth day, Jill spends double the previous day's total of 20 minutes on the phone, for 20 * 2 = 40 minutes. On the fifth and final day, Jill spends double the previous day's total of 40 minutes on the phone, for 40 * 2 = 80 minutes. All told, Jill spends 5 + 10 + 20 + 40 + 80 = 155 minutes on the phone over 5 days. The answer is 155.

[Question]Guise went to a restaurant and ate ten hot dogs on a Monday. That week, he ate two more dogs each day than the previous day. How many hot dogs had Guise eaten by Wednesday that week?
[Answer]Since Guise was eating 2 more hot dogs each day than the previous day and ate 10 hot dogs on Monday, he ate 10 + 2 = 12 hot dogs on Tuesday. By Tuesday Guise had eaten 12 + 10 = 22 hot dogs. On Wednesday, after eating two more hot dogs than the previous day, the total number of hot dogs he ate is 12 + 2 = 14. In the three days, Guise ate 14 + 22 = 36 hotdogs. The answer is 36.
Q: A company has 500 employees, each paid $12 per hour, working 10 hours a day, five days a week, 4 weeks a month. In August, the amount of work increased, and the company hired 200 more people. How much money does the company pay in total per month after the new hires?
A: The total pay per employee in a day is 12 * 10 = $120. An employee works for 5 * 4 = 20 days in a month. The total amount of money paid to each employee monthly is 20 * 120 = $2400. When the number of employees increased to 500 + 200 = 700 after the new hires in August. The company pays a total of 700 * 2400 = $1680000 per month to its employees. The answer is 1680000.
Question: 3 people run for president. John manages to capture 150 votes. James captures 70% of the remaining vote. If there were 1150 people voting, how many more votes did the third guy get than John?
Answer: There were 1150 - 150 = 1000 people who didn't vote for John. That means James got 1000 * .7 = 700 votes. So the other candidate got 1000 - 700 = 300 votes. This means he got 300 - 150 = 150 more votes than John. The answer is 150.
