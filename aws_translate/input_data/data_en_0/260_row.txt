Question: Melissa wants to make some dresses to sell at the upcoming festival. She has 56 square meters of fabric to make them. She knows that each dress takes 4 square meters of fabric and 3 hours to make. How many hours does she have to work?
Answer: Each dress takes 4 square meters of fabric to make, so the number of dresses she can make will be 56 / 4 = 14 dresses. Each dress takes 3 hours to make, thus she will have to work 14 dresses x 3 hours / dress = 42 hours. The answer is 42.
[Question]Roselyn gives Mara three times as many books as she gives Rebecca and remains with 60 books. If Rebecca received 40 books, how many books did Roselyn have before?
[Answer]If Roselyn gave Rebecca 40 books, and Mara was given three times as many books, Mara has 3 * 40 = 120 books. Rebecca and Mara's total number of books is 120 + 40 = 160 books. If Roselyn gave Mara and Rebecca her books, which is 160, then she initially had 60 + 160 = 220 books. The answer is 220.
Q: Jack goes hunting 6 times a month. The hunting season lasts for 1 quarter of the year. He catches 2 deers each time he goes hunting and they weigh 600 pounds each. He keeps half the weight of deer a year. How much deer does he keep in pounds?
A: The hunting season last 12 / 4 = 3 months. So he goes hunting 3 * 6 = 18 times a year. That means he gets 18 * 2 = 36 deers per year. So he catches 36 * 600 = 21,600 pounds of deer a year. That means he keeps 21600 / 2 = 10,800 pounds of deer a year. The answer is 10800.
Question: Jesse and Mia are competing in a week long race. They have one week to run 30 miles. On the first three days Jesse averages (2/3) of a mile. On day four she runs 10 miles. Mia averages 3 miles a day over the first 4 days. What is the average of their average that they have to run over the final three days?
Answer: Jesse runs 2 miles in the first three days because 3 x (2 / 3) = 2. Jesse has 18 miles left to run because 30 - 10 - 2 = 18. Jesse has to run an average of 6 miles a day because 18 / 3 = 6. Mia runs 12 miles over the first four days because 4 x 3 = 12. She has 18 miles left to run because 30 - 12 = 18. She has to run six miles a day because 18 / 3 = 6. The total they both have to run is 12 miles a day. The average they have to run per day on average is 6 miles because 12 / 2 = 6. The answer is 6.
[Question]Earl has $90; Fred has $48; Greg has $36. Earl owes Fred $28. Fred owes Greg $32. Greg owes Earl $40. When all debts are paid, how much will Greg and Earl have together in dollars?
[Answer]Earl will have $90 - $28 = $62 after paying off his debt to Fred. Fred will have $48 + $28 = $76 after being paid by Earl. But then Fred will have $76 - $32 = $44 after paying Greg. Greg will have $36 + $32 = $68 after Fred paid him. Then, Greg will have $68 - $40 = $28 after paying off his debt to Earl. Then, Earl will then have $62 + $40 = $102. So together, Greg and Earl will have $28 + $102 = $130. The answer is 130.
