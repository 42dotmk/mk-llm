Question: Due to a drought, Jerry's household can only use 1000 gallons of water during July. Jerry uses 100 gallons for drinking and cooking and 20 gallons per shower. He wants to fill his pool, which measures 10 feet by 10 feet by 6 feet. If each gallon of water fills 1 cubic foot of the pool, how many showers can Jerry take in July?
Answer: First find the total volume of the pool: 10 feet * 10 feet * 6 feet = 600 cubic feet. This is also the number of gallons he needs to fill the pool. Subtract the pool water and the drinking and cooking water from the total amount of water Jerry is allowed to use: 1000 gallons - 600 gallons - 100 gallons = 300 gallons. Then divide the amount of water Jerry has left to use for showers by the amount of water per shower to find how many showers he can take: 300 gallons / 20 gallons / shower = 15 showers. The answer is 15.

Q: Mr Castiel prepared 600 boar sausages on the weekend. He ate 2/5 of them on Monday, half of the remaining on Tuesday and saved the rest for Friday. If he ate 3/4 of the remaining boar sausages on Friday, how many sausages are left?
A: On Monday, Mr Castiel ate 2 / 5 * 600 = 240 sausages. The remaining number of sausages after he ate 240 on Monday is 600 - 240 = 360. On Tuesday, he ate half of the remaining sausages, a total of 360 / 2 = 180. The remaining number of sausages that he saved for Friday after eating 180 on Tuesday is 360 - 180 = 180. On Friday, Mr Castiel ate 3 / 4 * 180 = 135 of the sausages he had kept. The remaining number of sausages after he ate 135 on Friday is 180 - 135 = 45. The answer is 45.
Question: Kenny plans to mow lawns all summer, and then use the profits to buy video-games and books. He charges $15 per lawn. The video-games are $45 each. The books are $5 each. At the end of the summer he has mowed 35 lawns. There are 5 video-games he really wants, and then he will use the rest for books. How many books can he buy?
Answer: Kenny earns $525 because 35 x 15 = 525. He spends $225 on video games because 5 x 45 = 225. He has $300 left because 525 - 225 = 300. He can buy 60 books because 300 / 5 = 60. The answer is 60.
