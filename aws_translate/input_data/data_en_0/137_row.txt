Title: Critics Confess Their Love for 'Fast Five', Surprising Audiences and Themselves

In an era of endless franchises and sequels, the highly entertaining and adrenaline-filled 'Fast Five' has officially bucked the trend of diminishing returns, scoring an impressive 77% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and earning surprising admiration from the critics. The Fast and the Furious has yet again defied expectations with this fifth installment, quickly securing a spot in the hearts of series veterans and newcomers alike.

Peter Travers of Rolling Stone unapologetically confesses his newfound love for the film, stating, "Bless me, father of all critic gods, for I have sinned: I liked Fast Five. I watched the cars smashing in IMAX and smiled." While the acting in the film may not be winning any Oscars, it seems that the cast has embraced the sheer fun of it all and allowed their endearing ineptitude to create a truly immersive experience that is simply enjoyable.

According to Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe, Fast Five is “the most honest Hollywood movie of the year,” offering fun and excitement without even a hint of pretentiousness. The chemistry between Vin Diesel and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson has been praised as well, as Morris describes them as "the Pacino and De Niro of absurdly muscled, totally bald, racially mixed action heroes."

Chicago Sun-Times' renowned critic Roger Ebert, although not entirely in love with the film, admits to the undeniable appeal of Fast Five's relentless action sequences and borderline ridiculous stunts. The movie is made up of "sheer, preposterous, and nonstop impossible action, muscular macho guys, hot chicks," and ultimately incompetent villains. While Ebert laments the lack of laughs in the film, audiences will undoubtedly find joy in the film's electrifying energy and fast-paced nature.

Kyle Smith of the New York Post has one minor complaint about Fast Five: "Until the finale, it has no car chases to speak of," leaving viewers with "a lot of dull caper-plotting." While this may be true, the film's explosive finale more than makes up for any lulls in the action. Moreover, Fast Five's two-hour runtime might seem extensive at first, but Smith notes that it's "because it takes that long to read every item in the cliché dictionary." The familiarity with classic action tropes lends a sense of comfort to audiences while still maintaining the thrill Fast Five delivers.

In conclusion, Fast Five has firmly established itself as a standout in the sea of sequels, offering fans a thrilling, action-packed experience that defies traditional expectations for a fifth installment. Critics who may have initially dismissed the film have found themselves caught up in the undeniable fun of the franchise, proving that even seasoned reviewers can't help but smile at the absurdity and excitement the Fast and the Furious series continues to bring. With Fast Five, it seems that the iconic characters and their gravity-defying stunt sequences have captured hearts all around, providing viewers with a much-needed dose of enjoyable entertainment.
