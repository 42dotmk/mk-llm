Question: A rectangle has a length of 40 meters and a width of 20 meters. A similar smaller rectangle has half the length and width of the big rectangle. What's the area of the smaller rectangle?
Answer: The length of the smaller rectangle is 1 / 2 * 40 = 20 meters. The width of the smaller rectangle is 1 / 2 * 20 = 10 meters. Since the area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length times the width, the total area of the smaller rectangle is 20 * 10 = 200 meters square. The answer is 200.
[Question]John eats 3 meals a day. Breakfast is 500 calories. His lunch contains 25% more calories than that. His dinner is twice as many calories as lunch. He also has 3 shakes that are each 300 calories. How many calories does he get in a day?
[Answer]Lunch is 500 * .25 = 125 more calories than breakfast. That means it is 500 + 125 = 625 calories. So dinner is 625 * 2 = 1250 calories. The shakes are 3 * 300 = 900 calories. So in total he eats 500 + 625 + 1250 + 900 = 3275 calories. The answer is 3275.
Q: There were 28 students inside a bus before stopping at an intersection. After stopping at an intersection, there were 58 students on the bus. What's 40% of the number of students who entered the bus at the intermediate stop?
A: At the intermediate stop, 58 - 28 = 30 students entered the bus before it stopped at the intersection. 40% of the number of students who entered the bus at the intermediate stop is 40 / 100 * 30 = 12. The answer is 12.
Question: Three builders build a single floor of a house in 30 days. If each builder is paid $100 for a single dayâ€™s work, how much would it cost to hire 6 builders to build 5 houses with 6 floors each?
Answer: 6 builders can build a single floor 6 builders / 3 builders = 2 times as fast as 3 builders. Thus 6 builders would build a single floor in 30 days / 2 = 15 days. There are 5 hours x 6 floors / house = 30 floors in total in 5 houses with 6 floors each. Therefore 6 builders would complete the project in 15 days / floor x 30 floors = 450 days. It would cost 450 days x $100 / day / builder * 6 builders = $270000 to complete the project. The answer is 270000.
[Question]Kiaan is doing home delivery of newspapers in his neighborhood of 200 homes. After an hour of work, he has distributed newspapers to 2/5 of the homes. After another 2 hours of working, he realizes he has distributed newspapers to 60 percent of the remaining homes. How many homes does he still need to distribute the newspapers to?
[Answer]After the first hour of work, he has distributed newspapers to 2 / 5 * 200 = 80 homes. The number of homes that still need newspapers is 200 - 80 = 120. Two hours later, the number of homes he has distributed newspapers to is 60 / 100 * 120 = 72 homes. The number of homes he still needs to distribute newspapers to is 120 - 72 = 48 homes. The answer is 48.
