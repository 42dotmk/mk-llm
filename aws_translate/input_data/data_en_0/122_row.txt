The conference event described falls under the category of "World" as it pertains to global affairs, politics, and military actions. The protest by delegates against the U.S.-led military operation in Najaf highlights the international conflicts, debates, and diplomatic issues that are commonly associated with this topic.

The situation described in the statement involves the U.S.-led military operation in Najaf, which is a city in Iraq. Najaf has significant religious importance for Shia Muslims since it houses the Imam Ali Shrine. The U.S. military presence in the region during the Iraq War led to various confrontations with insurgent groups.

The conference mentioned in the statement could refer to any political, diplomatic, or international gathering where representatives from different countries and organizations have come together to discuss pressing global issues. Considering the disruptive nature of the protests, it seems likely that the delegates were passionately opposed to the military actions taking place in Najaf, which caused the conference to devolve into chaos.

This chaotic turn of events would fit under the "World" category as it signifies the broad political, cultural, and societal implications of ongoing international conflicts and their impact on diplomatic processes. Events like this could potentially lead to discussions of the use of military force, the efficacy of diplomatic relations, and efforts to find workable solutions for conflict resolution â€“ all of which are themes that are directly relevant to global affairs and politics.

In contrast, it is evident that this event does not fit the other options given, namely "Sports," "Business," and "Science/Tech," as they are primarily focused on different areas of interest:

- Sports: This option generally deals with athletic contests, related news, and events focused on professional or amateur physical competitions. The event mentioned in the statement is unrelated to sports or athletics, as it is a conference and does not involve any competitive physical activity.
- Business: While international conflicts can significantly impact the business world, this event seems to focus primarily on the political and diplomatic aspects of the U.S.-led military operation in Najaf. The Business category would be more relevant if the issue discussed at the conference were centered around financial, economic, or corporate topics directly associated with the ongoing conflict.
- Science/Tech: This option pertains to the realm of scientific research, technological advancements, and their applications in various sectors. The event described in the statement is a political conflict and has no direct connection to scientific or technological issues.

As such, the appropriate selection for the topic of the given statement is "World," given its focus on international relations, political disputes, and military actions. The demonstration's relevance to global affairs and politics is undeniable, and it highlights the complex nature of navigating international concerns and conflicts that shape our world.
