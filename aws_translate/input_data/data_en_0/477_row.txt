Q: Oliver owns a laundry shop, and he charges $2 per kilo of laundry. Two days ago, his shop washed a total of 5 kilos of laundries. Yesterday, it washed five kilos of laundries more than the previous day. Today, it washed twice the number of kilos than yesterday.  How much did he earn for three days?
A: Yesterday, his shop washed 5 + 5 = 10 kilos of laundry. Today, it washed 2 x 10 = 20 kilos of laundry. Thus, Oliver's shop washed a total of 5 + 10 + 20 = 35 kilos of laundries for three days. Therefore, his shop earned 35 x $2 = $70 for three days. The answer is 70.
Question: Lauren's social media channel makes $0.50 for every commercial that's viewed and $1.00 for every person who subscribes. On Tuesday, 100 people watched commercials before viewing her content and 27 people subscribed. How much money did she make?
Answer: She makes $0.50 for viewed commercials and 100 people watched them on Tuesday for a total of .50 * 100 = $50.00. She makes $1.00 for every person who subscribes and she had 27 people sign up so that's 1 * 27 = $27.00. Between the viewed commercials that made $50.00 and the $27.00 she made from new subscribers, she made 50 + 27 = $77.00. The answer is 77.
[Question]James needs to get a new pair of glasses. His frames cost $200 and the lenses cost $500. Insurance will cover 80% of the cost of lenses and he has a $50 off coupon for frames. How much does everything cost?
[Answer]He gets 500 * .8 = $400 off the cost of lenses. That means the lenses cost 500 - 400 = $100. The frames cost 200 - 50 = $150. So he pays 100 + 150 = $250. The answer is 250.
Q: Bob wants to build a pyramid out of legos with 3 levels where the bottom level has 7 legos per side and each level has one less lego per side than the level below it. How many legos total will he need?
A: First find the total number of legos on the bottom layer: 7 legos * 7 legos = 49 legos. Then find the number of legos per side on the next layer: 7 legos - 1 lego = 6 legos. Then find the total number of legos on the second level: 6 legos * 6 legos = 36 legos. Then find the number of legos per side on the top level: 6 legos - 1 lego = 5 legos. Then find the total number of legos on the top level: 5 legos * 5 legos = 25 legos. Then add the number of legos on each level to find the total number of legos: 49 legos + 36 legos + 25 legos = 110 legos. The answer is 110.
