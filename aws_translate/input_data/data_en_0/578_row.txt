In the aftermath of this crucial encounter, the Bengals steadily notched up an impressive tally of victories, dominating their competition. In this article, we closely examine the Cincinnati Bengals' striking progress following that game and quantify their overall performance by comparing their wins to losses.

A Look at the Numbers:
