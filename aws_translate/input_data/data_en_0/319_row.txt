[Question]DJ Snake's friends decided to give him treats to celebrate his engagement. Moksi took him and his fiancee to a luxurious hotel for two nights at $4000 per night. Lil Jon bought them a car worth $30000, and Wynter presented them with a house worth four times the value of the car Lil Jon bought them. What was the total value of all the treats DJ Snake received on his engagement day?
[Answer]Moksi took DJ Snake and his fiancee to a luxurious hotel for two nights at $4000 per night, for a total of 2 * $4000 = $8000. If Lil Jon also bought them a car worth $30000, the value of the treats from Lil John and Moksi summed up to $8000 + $30000 = $38000. Wynter presented them with a house worth four times the value of the car Lil Jon bought them, a total of 4 * $30000 = $120000. The total value of all the treats DJ Snake received on his engagement day is $120000 + $38000 = $158000. The answer is 158000.
Q: Ethan is reading a sci-fi book that has 360 pages. He read 40 pages on Saturday morning and another 10 pages at night. The next day he read twice the total pages as on Saturday. How many pages does he have left to read?
A: Ethan read a total of 40 pages + 10 pages = 50 pages on Saturday. On the next day, he read a total of 50 pages x 2 = 100 pages. The total number of pages that Ethan had read is 50 pages + 100 pages = 150 pages. Therefore, Ethan has 360 pages - 150 pages = 210 pages left to read. The answer is 210.
Question: There are 100 lions in Londolozi at first. If lion cubs are born at the rate of 5 per month and lions die at the rate of 1 per month, how many lions will there be in Londolozi after 1 year?
Answer: There are 5 - 1 = 4 more lions each month. There will be 4 * 12 = 48 more lions after 1 year. There will be 100 + 48 = 148 lions in Londolozi after 1 year. The answer is 148.
[Question]Kristin can run three times faster than Sarith. If Kristin runs 12 times around the adult football field and Sarith runs at the same time around the children's football field that is half the distance as the other field, how many laps did Sarith go around the children's football field?
[Answer]Sarith would run around the adult football field, 12 laps / 3 = 4 laps. So on the children's football field, she managed to run, 4 laps * 2 = 8 laps. The answer is 8.
Q: Gretchen's local ice cream shop offers 100 different flavors. She was able to try a 1/4 of the flavors 2 years ago and double that amount last year. How many more flavors will she need to try this year to have tried all 100 flavors?
A: The shop offers 100 flavors and she tried 1 / 4 of the flavors so she had 100 * .25 = 25 flavors 2 years ago. Last year she ate double the amount from the previous year so she had 25 * 2 = 50 flavors. 2 years ago she ate 25 flavors and last year she had 50 flavors so she has had 25 + 50 = 75 flavors. The shop offers 100 flavors and she has had 75 flavors so she still needs to try 100 - 75 = 25 flavors. The answer is 25.
