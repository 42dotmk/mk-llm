First question: How historically and factually accurate is the Netflix drama Marco Polo?

The Netflix series Marco Polo, which premiered in 2014, is a historical drama loosely based on the life of the Venetian merchant and explorer Marco Polo. The show was created by John Fusco and chronicles Marco Polo's journey and experiences in the court of Kublai Khan. Although the series is inspired by historical events and characters, there are several inaccuracies and fictional elements that have been incorporated for the sake of storytelling and entertainment.

1. Characters: While some of the characters are real figures from history, such as Marco Polo, Kublai Khan, and Chabi (Kublai Khan's principal wife), other characters like Prince Jingim (Kublai's son) and Hundred Eyes (martial arts expert and Polo's trainer) are fictional or loosely based on historical figures.

2. Timeframe: The show compresses several events and experiences that Polo encountered over his 24-year long travels in the East and this timeline compression may result in inaccuracies regarding the chronology of events.

3. Relationship between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan: While Marco Polo did serve in the court of Kublai Khan, it is improbable that he held such a prominent and influential position as depicted in the series. It is suggested that his role was more of a junior diplomat and merchant, rather than a key advisor.

4. Cultural and historical aspects: The series tends to present anachronistic and exoticized depictions of Asian cultures, which may not be entirely accurate. Additionally, it dramatizes certain historical events and battles for the sake of storytelling and entertainment, which can distort the factual accuracy of these events.

Overall, while the series is entertaining and provides a glimpse into the world of Marco Polo and the Mongol Empire, it should not be relied on as an accurate historical account.

Second question: How historically accurate is How to Train Your Dragon?

How to Train Your Dragon is a series of animated films based on the children's books by Cressida Cowell. The story revolves around the Viking village of Berk and a young Viking named Hiccup, who befriends a dragon named Toothless. It is essential to note that How to Train Your Dragon is a work of fiction and fantasy, and it contains many fantastical elements, such as dragons and fictionalized Norse cultures. While there may be some aspects inspired by historical Viking culture, the series should not be considered historically accurate. Its primary purpose is to entertain with a focus on storytelling, character development, and creative world-building.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?

Both questions are inquiring about the historical accuracy of the respective media productions, with the first focused on the Netflix drama Marco Polo and the second on the animated film series How to Train Your Dragon. While the context of the two questions is similar - assessing the accuracy of their historical depictions - they are ultimately asking about the accuracy of two different stories, time periods, and genres.
