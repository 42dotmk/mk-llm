[Question]A movie theatre has 250 seats. The cost of a ticket is $6 for an adult and $4 for a child. The theatre is full and contains 188 children. What is the total ticket revenue for this movie session?
[Answer]The number of adults present is 250 – 188 = 62 adults. The revenue generated by adults is 62 * 6 = $372. The revenue generated by children is 188 * 4 = $752. So the total ticket revenue is 372 + 752 = $1124. The answer is 1124.
Q: Julian has 80 Facebook friends. 60% are boys and 40% are girls. Boyd has twice as many friends who are girls and has 100 friends total. What percentage of Boyd’s friends are boys?
A: Julian's number of friends who are girls is .40 * 80 = 32. Boyd has twice as many friends as Julian who are girls, a total of 2 * 32 = 64. If Boyd has 100 friends, he has 100 - 64 = 36 boys. The percentage of boys in Boyd's Facebook friends is 36 / 100 * 100 = 36. The answer is 36.
Question: Susan is picking strawberries. She's trying to fill her basket, but out of every handful of 5 strawberries she can't help but eat one of them herself. If her basket holds 60 strawberries, how many berries will she actually pick before she fills it?
Answer: Out of every 5 berries, she eats 1, so only 5 strawberries - 1 strawberry = 4 strawberries go into the basket for each handful. The basket holds 60 strawberries, so it will take 60 strawberries / 4 strawberries per handful = 15 handfuls to fill the basket. So in total, Susan will pick 60 strawberries + 15 handfuls * 1 strawberry eaten per handful = 75 strawberries. The answer is 75.
[Question]In five years, Grant will be 2/3 the age of the hospital that he is hired into. If Grant is currently 25 years old, how old is the hospital now?
[Answer]If Grant is currently 25 years old, he will be 25 + 5 = 30 years old in five years. If 2 / 3 represents Grant's age in five years, then the fraction representing the number of years the hospital is older than Grant is 1 - 2 / 3 = 1 / 3. If 2 / 3 represents 30 years, 3 / 3, which is the fraction representing the age of the hospital, represents 3 / 3 * 30 * 3 / 2 = 45 years. Currently, the hospital is 45 - 5 = 40 years old. The answer is 40.
Q: Joe and Adam built a garden wall with three courses of bricks. They realized the wall was too low and added 2 more courses. If each course of the wall had 400 bricks, and they took out half of the bricks in the last course to allow easy checkup of the garden, calculate the total number of bricks the wall has.
A: When they added two more courses for the wall, the number of courses became 3 + 2 = 5. Since each course has 400 bricks, the total number of bricks for 5 courses is 5 * 400 = 2000. To allow for an easy checkup of the wall, they removed 1 / 2 * 400 = 200 bricks from the last course of the wall. In total, the wall has 2000 - 200 = 1800 bricks. The answer is 1800.
