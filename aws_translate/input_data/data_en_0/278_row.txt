While both questions deal with the preparation of steaks at Outback Steakhouses, they do differ in the scope of the information being sought. 

1. "How do Outback Steakhouses prepare and cook their steaks?"
This question is asking for a detailed and comprehensive explanation of both the preparation process and the cooking methods used for steaks at Outback Steakhouses. This covers aspects such as seasoning, marinating, the choice of cuts, and cooking temperatures, as well as any other factors that contribute to the final product. 

To answer this question, let's first look at the preparation process:
Outback Steakhouse is known for its signature steaks, which typically come in various cuts including rib-eye, filet, New York strip, and sirloin. The preparation process starts with selecting high-quality cuts of meat, usually sourced from trusted suppliers to ensure the best possible taste and texture. The steaks are then aged to enhance their flavor and tenderness.

During the preparation stage, the steaks are seasoned using the restaurant's proprietary blend of 17 spices, which is a closely-guarded secret. This spice blend provides the unique and distinctive flavor Outback Steakhouse is known for. The steaks can also be marinated, if necessary, in a special marinade tailored to each specific cut of meat.

Now, let's discuss the cooking process:
Outback Steakhouses use a combination of grilling and broiling to cook their steaks. This method sears in the flavors while ensuring that the steaks are cooked to the desired level of doneness. The restaurant uses concept flame grills, which are specifically designed for high-heat cooking. These grills can reach temperatures of up to 650°F (343°C), which allows for a perfect sear and crust on the outside of the steak while maintaining tenderness on the inside. 

Customers can request their preferred level of doneness, ranging from rare to well-done, and the steaks are cooked accordingly. The cooking times and temperatures vary depending on factors like the thickness of the steak and the desired level of doneness, but they generally use consistent guidelines to achieve the expected results.

2. "How do Outback Steakhouses prepare their steaks?"
This question is focused on the preparation process and does not explicitly inquire about the cooking methods. It seeks information on factors such as seasoning, the choice of cuts, and any other steps that take place before the actual cooking process begins.

To answer this question, a detailed explanation would cover the selection of high-quality cuts of meat and the aging process that enhances the flavor and tenderness of the steaks. Additionally, the answer would mention Outback Steakhouse's proprietary blend of 17 spices used for seasoning and any marination process tailored to specific cuts of meat.

In summary, while both questions revolve around the steaks served at Outback Steakhouses, the first question asks for a more comprehensive response that includes both preparation and cooking methods, whereas the second question explicitly focuses on the preparation stage only.
