Answer based on context:

Following their bye week, the Patriots traveled to Buffalo to play the Bills, who had won 5 of 7 since their 38-7 Week 3 loss to the Patriots. On the first drive of the game, Gay intercepted Losman to give the Patriots the ball at the Bills' 21-yard line. Two plays later, Maroney ran it in from 6&#160;yards out for a Patriots touchdown. After a Bills punt, the Patriots increased their lead to 14-0 after a 43-yard touchdown reception by Moss from Brady. The touchdown, Moss' 13th on the season, broke Stanley Morgan's franchise record of 12 touchdown passes in a single season. On the ensuing drive, a Green strip-sack of Losman was recovered by the Bills, and two plays later, Roscoe Parrish caught a 47-yard touchdown pass for the only Bills touchdown of the game. The Patriots' next drive went for 72&#160;yards and ended in a 16-yard Moss touchdown reception on the first play of the second quarter. A Bills punt on their next possession gave the Patriots the ball at their own 16-yard line. Aided by catches of 25, 15, 11, and 10&#160;yards by Watson, Welker, Stallworth, and Faulk respectively, the Patriots drove 84&#160;yards in under 7&#160;minutes, capping off the drive with a 6-yard touchdown reception to Moss. That touchdown gave Brady the most career touchdown passes in Patriots franchise history, breaking Steve Grogan's record of 182. Another Bills punt led to the Patriots' fifth possession and fifth touchdown of the half, this time a 17-yard Moss touchdown catch ended another 72-yard drive. Moss' fourth touchdown of the half tied an NFL record for touchdowns for a single player before halftime, and set the Patriots' franchise record for touchdowns by a player in a game. Adalius Thomas also had 2.5 sacks in the half, setting a single-game career high. The Patriots began the second half where they left off in the first, driving 73&#160;yards in more than 6&#160;minutes for another touchdown, this one a 3-yard reception by Watson. The Bills responded with a 29-yard Terrence McGee kickoff return that led to a 52-yard Rian Lindell field goal to cut the Patriots lead to 42-10. The Patriots' next series, their seventh of the game, also ended in their seventh touchdown of the game, setting a Patriots franchise single-season touchdown record (1961 and 1980, 52). A Welker screen pass went 24&#160;yards to put the Patriots in the Bills' red zone, and a 1-yard Eckel touchdown run on the first play of the fourth quarter gave the Patriots a 49-10 lead. On the second play of the Bills' next drive, Sanders forced a fumble by running back Dwayne Wright after a 5-yard reception, which Hobbs recovered and returned 35&#160;yards for the Patriots' eighth and final touchdown of the game. The Patriots' 56 points tied a franchise record, and were the most points scored by a road team in the NFL since 1973. Their 46-point scoring margin was also the second-largest in team history. The Patriots' 56-10 win brought their record to 10-0, the tenth time since 1970 a team started a season 10-0.
