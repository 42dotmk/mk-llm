Choh Hao Li was a renowned Chinese-American biochemist, best known for his work in discovering and synthesizing the human pituitary growth hormone. Born on April 21, 1913, in Guangzhou, China, Li made significant contributions to the fields of endocrinology and biochemistry throughout his lifetime.

Li's early education took place in China, where he developed an interest in the sciences. In 1933, he received his Bachelor of Science degree from Nanjing University in China. Afterward, he moved to the United States, where he continued his studies and research pursuits. He obtained his Ph.D. from the University of California in 1938, where he developed expertise in the apparatus and techniques required for peptide synthesis.

After obtaining his Ph.D., Li held various teaching and research positions at different institutions, but his primary affiliation was with the University of California. His work at the university helped him become an internationally recognized authority in the fields of protein and peptide chemistry, endocrinology, and molecular biology.

Choh Hao Li's groundbreaking work in the study of hormones and proteins enabled him to discover and synthesize human pituitary growth hormone. This breakthrough had immense significance, as it paved the way for the development of medical treatments for growth disorders and opened new avenues in the field of endocrinology.

Throughout his storied career, Li authored or co-authored more than 1,000 scientific articles and was awarded numerous patents for his work. His research contributed significantly to the understanding of several hormone structures and functions, including the luteinizing hormone, the melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and the adrenocorticotropic hormone. His work in synthesizing the human pituitary growth hormone demonstrated the feasibility of producing large quantities of hormones through laboratory synthesis, which had far-reaching implications in medicine.

In addition to his scientific accomplishments, Li was an active member of multiple professional organizations and received several awards, honors, and recognitions for his work. His contributions to the field earned him the prestigious Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award in 1963, the Pearl Meister Greengard Prize in 1980, and the National Medal of Science in 1984.

Holding dual nationality of the Republic of China and the United States, Choh Hao Li was a proud and dedicated scientist, consistently working to progress scientific knowledge and improve human health. He passed away in the United States on November 28, 1987, at the age of 74.

In summary, Choh Hao Li's contributions to the fields of endocrinology and biochemistry have left an indelible mark on scientific history. His work in discovering and synthesizing the human pituitary growth hormone has facilitated critical advancements in the understanding and treatment of various growth disorders. With an unwavering commitment to research and innovation, Li's life stands as an inspiration to generations of researchers, paving the way for future advancements in medicine and science.
