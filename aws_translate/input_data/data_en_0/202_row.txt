To answer these questions, I will provide information and analysis on each subject.

Question 1: Why do countries like India and China not take part in the war against ISIS?

Step 1: Understand the core issue
The user is asking about the reasons for India and China's lack of direct involvement in the war against ISIS.

Step 2: Identify the main actors and their stance
ISIS, or the Islamic State, has been at the center of an international military coalition composed of Western and Middle Eastern countries. India and China, despite their significant global influence, have not taken part in this military intervention directly.

Step 3: Analyze the reasons for their stance
There are several reasons for India and China's non-involvement:

1. National priorities: Both countries have different national priorities and security concerns, such as border disputes and domestic terrorism, which may take precedence over joining the military campaign against ISIS.

2. Limited direct threat: While India and China have experienced terrorist attacks from groups affiliated with ISIS, the direct threat from the group's core operations in Iraq and Syria has been comparatively low.

3. Relation with other countries: Both countries maintain complex relationships with regional players involved in the conflict, including Russia, Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. Direct involvement in the war against ISIS could alter these delicate balances of power and diplomacy.

4. Non-interventionist foreign policies: India and China generally adhere to non-interventionist foreign policies that emphasize supporting diplomatic solutions over military intervention.

Question 2: Is Taiwan part of or separate from China?

Step 1: Understand the core issue
The user is asking about Taiwan's political status and whether it is part of China or a separate entity.

Step 2: Identify historical context
After the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the Republic of China (ROC) government retreated to Taiwan, while the People's Republic of China (PRC) was established on the Chinese mainland.

Step 3: Analyze the current situation
Currently, the "One China" policy emphasizes that there is only one sovereign state named "China" and that Taiwan is a part of that state. Most countries, including the United States, officially recognize the PRC as the legitimate government of China, although some maintain unofficial relations with Taiwan. Taiwan operates as a separate, democratic political entity with its own government and economy but faces pressure from the PRC to one day reunify under the "One China" policy.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?

No, the answers to these two questions are not the same. The first question concerns the foreign policies and priorities of India and China, specifically their approach to the war against ISIS. The second question is about Taiwan's political status and its relationship with China. While both questions involve China and touch upon political complexities and international relations, the subject matter and analysis for each question are distinct.
