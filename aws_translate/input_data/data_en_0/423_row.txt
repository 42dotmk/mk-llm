Question: Sean and Sierra invited 200 guests to their wedding. If 83% of the guests RSVP with a Yes response and 9% of the guests RSVP with a No response, how many guests did not respond at all?
Answer: Yes RSVP responses are 200 x 83% = 166 guests. No RSVP responses are 200 x 9% = 18 guests. Guests who responded are 166 + 18 = 184. Guests who did not respond at all are 200 - 184 = 16. The answer is 16.
[Question]After complaints from the residents of Tatoosh about the number of cats on the island, the wildlife service carried out a relocation mission that saw the number of cats on the island drastically reduced. On the first relocation mission, 600 cats were relocated from the island to a neighboring island. On the second mission, half of the remaining cats were relocated to a rescue center inland. If the number of cats originally on the island was 1800, how many cats remained on the island after the rescue mission?
[Answer]After the first mission, the number of cats remaining on the island was 1800 - 600 = 1200. If half of the remaining cats on the island were relocated to a rescue center inland, the number of cats taken by the wildlife service on the second mission is 1200 / 2 = 600 cats. The number of cats remaining on the island is 1200 - 600 = 600. The answer is 600.
Q: Lana and Mike are taking their dog and renting a cabin in the mountains for 2 weeks. The daily rate is $125.00 There is a $100.00 pet fee. There is also a 20% service/cleaning fee for the rental. They need to pay 50% of the entire bill as a security deposit. How much is their security deposit?
A: There are 7 days in a week and they're going for 2 weeks so that's 7 * 2 = 14 days. The daily rate is $125.00 and they are staying for 14 days so that's 125 * 14 = $1,750.00. There is also a $100.00 pet fee on top of their rental fee of $1,750.00 so that's 100 + 1750 = $1850.00. There is a 20% fee on the $1,850.00 so the fee comes to .20 * 1850 = $370.00. The rental will costs $1,850.00 and there is $370.00 service / cleaning fee for a total of 1850 + 370 = $2,220.00. They need to pay 50% of the entire bill as a security deposit so that will be .5 * 2220 = $1,110.00. The answer is 1110.
Question: In my school, the number of students has increased by 20% this year. The number of students this year is 960. How many students were there last year?
Answer: Let X be the number of students last year. The number of students this year is X + X * 20% = 960. Combining like terms, we get X * 1.2 = 960. Dividing both sides by 1.2, we get X = 800 students. The answer is 800.
