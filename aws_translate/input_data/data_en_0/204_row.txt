Q: Osborn is testing a new way to get dressed in the morning on school days so he goes faster and can get up later. He tracks his time for the week and on Monday is takes him 2 minutes. On Tuesday it takes him 4 minutes. On Wednesday it takes him 3 minutes. On Thursday it takes him 4 minutes. Before Friday arrives he looks at his old way of getting dressed and sees that it was taking him 3 minutes on average to get dressed. How fast does he have to get dressed on Friday so his weekly average ties his old method?
A: If it takes on average 3 minutes to get dressed, then it takes 15 minutes total on the school week because 5 x 3 = 15. Thus far this week it has taken him 13 minutes to get dressed because 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13. To tie his previous method, he needs to take 2 minutes on Friday because 15 - 13 = 2. The answer is 2.

[Question]Brenda and nine of her friends want to order a pizza. They decide that each person will eat 2 slices. If each pizza has 4 slices, how many pizzas should they order?
[Answer]All together, Brenda and her friends make a group of 1 + 9 = 10 people. If they each want to eat 2 pizza slices, there should be 10 * 2 = 20 slices. Since a pizza has 4 slices, they will have to order 20 / 4 = 5 pizzas. The answer is 5.
Q: Jillian, Savannah, and Clayton were collecting shells on the beach. Jillian collected 29, Savannah collected 17, and Clayton collected 8. They decided that they wanted to give the shells to two of their friends who had just arrived. They put their shells together and distributed them evenly to each friend. How many shells did each friend get?

Question: Brenda raises mice, and her adult mice recently had three litters of 8 each. She gave a sixth of the baby mice to her friend Robbie to keep as pets. She sold three times the number of babies she gave Robbie to a pet store. Half of the remaining mice were sold to snake owners as feeder mice. How many baby mice did Brenda have left?
Answer: Brendaâ€™s mice had 3 * 8 = 24 baby mice. She gave Robbie 24 / 6 = 4 mice. Thus, she sold 3 * 4 = 12 mice to the pet store. She had 24 - 12 - 4 = 8 mice remaining. She sold 8 / 2 = 4 as feeder mice. Thus, Brenda had 8 - 4 = 4 mice left. The answer is 4.
