Financial disclosure ordered for military mentors

Financial disclosure ordered for military mentors

By Tom Vanden Brook, USA TODAY

WASHINGTON Â— After pressure from two key senators, the Pentagon has reversed course and will require that the retired generals and admirals it hires as consultants file public, not confidential, financial disclosure statements, according to letters from Congress and the Defense Department.

Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and John McCain, R-Ariz., the chairman and ranking member on the Armed Services Committee, told the Pentagon that "senior mentors exercise a level of ... influence" that demands public disclosure. They wrote that if the Pentagon resisted, they would propose legislation mandating it.

Leigh Bradley, a top Pentagon lawyer, responded to their letter by seeking a ruling from the Office of Government Ethics to require public disclosures. Among the reasons she cited for greater transparency is the mentors' ability to affect Pentagon policy. "They will be in a unique position to inform and influence war planning at the highest level and may, ultimately, hold some sway, indirect or otherwise, regarding defense purchasing decisions," Bradley wrote in a Sept. 27 letter.

Rep. Robert Andrews, a New Jersey Democrat who chairs a panel on reforming defense acquisition, called the Pentagon's decision a "no brainer."

"Anybody who consults with the Pentagon about the right way to conduct its programs needs to disclose potential conflicts of interest," Andrews said.

A USA TODAY investigation last year found that mentors made up to $440 an hour in taxpayer dollars, many times their pay while in uniform. Mentors advise active-duty officers, take part in war games and aid in military planning. The earnings came on top of military pensions as high as $220,000 a year. At the same time, many mentors held jobs with defense contractors selling products and services to the Pentagon.

In April, Defense Secretary Robert Gates responded to those findings, capping mentors' pay at $179,000 and requiring public financial disclosures. He also subjected them to rules barring conflicts of interest.

The Pentagon, however, retreated from those restrictions this summer. A ruling from the Office of Government Ethics allowed mentors to file confidential disclosure forms. The Pentagon also considered shielding mentors' names, Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, said in July. Whitman said Wednesday that the Pentagon is setting up a process that requires mentors to file the public disclosure forms.

The new rule will apply to mentors making more than $119,553, according to a letter from William Lynn, deputy Defense secretary.

Mandy Smithberger, a national security investigator for the Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog group, called the Pentagon's decision "fantastic news" for open and transparent government.
