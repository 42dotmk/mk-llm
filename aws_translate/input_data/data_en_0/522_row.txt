Q: At peak hours, 11 am - 1 pm and 5 pm - 6 pm, the local fast-food restaurant serves 12 cars every 15 minutes. Off-peak times, they serve 8 cars every 15 minutes. From 4 pm - 6 pm, how many customers do they serve?
A: 5 pm - 6 pm is one hour and they measure service in 15 - minute blocks so 60 / 15 = 4 15 min blocks. At peak times, they serve 12 cars every 15 minutes so they serve 12 * 4 = 48 cars in 60 minutes. Off peak times, 4pm - 5 pm, they serve 8 cars every 15 minutes so they serve 8 * 4 = 32 cars in 60 minutes. From 4pm - 5 pm they serve 32 cars and from 5pm - 6 pm they serve 48 cars so they serve 32 + 48 = 80 cars. The answer is 80.

[Question]William read 6 books last month and Brad read thrice as many books as William did. This month, in an effort to catch up, Williams read twice as much as Brad, who read 8 books. Who has read more across the two months, and by how much?
[Answer]Last month Brad read thrice 6 books for a total of 3 * 6 = 18 books. This month Williams read twice 8 books for a total of 2 * 8 = 16 books.

Question: Carter has a 14-hour road trip. He wants to stop every 2 hours to stretch his legs. He also wants to make 2 additional stops for food and 3 additional stops for gas. If each pit stop takes 20 minutes, how many hours will his road trip become?
Answer: He has a 14 - hour trip and wants to stop every 2 hours so that's 14 / 2 = 7 pit stops. He will make 7 pit stops plus 2 more for food and 3 more for gas for a total of 7 + 2 + 3 = 12 pit stops. Each pit stop will take 20 minutes and he is making 12 stops so that's 20 * 12 = 240 minutes. 60 minutes are in an hour and he's adding 240 minutes to his trip so that's 240 / 60 = 4 more hours. His trip started as 14 hours and he will add an additional 4 hours in pit stops for a total of a 14 + 4 = 18 hour long trip. The answer is 18.
