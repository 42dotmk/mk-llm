Q: Traci and Harris are baking cakes together. Traci has brought flour from her own house and Harris has 400g of flour in his house. Each cake needs 100g of flour and Traci and Harris have created 9 cakes each. How much flour, in grams, did Traci bring from her own house?
A: To make the cakes, Traci and Harris used a total of 9 cakes * 100g of flour per cake = 900g of flour. Traci therefore brought 900g of needed flour – 400g of flour from Harris’ flour = 500g of flour from her own house. The answer is 500.
Question: Rebecca makes her own earrings out of buttons, magnets, and gemstones. For every earring, she uses two magnets, half as many buttons as magnets, and three times as many gemstones as buttons. If Rebecca wants to make 4 sets of earrings, how many gemstones will she need?
Answer: Four sets of earrings is 2 * 4 = 8 earrings. Since for one earring, she uses two magnets, for eight earrings she uses 2 * 8 = 16 magnets. Since she uses half as many buttons as magnets, then for 8 earrings she would use 16 / 2 = 8 buttons. Since she uses three times as many gemstones as buttons, then in 8 earrings, she will use 8 * 3 = 24 gemstones. The answer is 24.
[Question]A luxury perfume costs $1200. The store owner decided to increase its price by 10% so that he could earn more profit. Few weeks had past but the perfume was still not sold. So, the owner decided to lower the price by 15%. By how much was the final price lower than the original price?
[Answer]There was a $1200 x 10 / 100 = $120 increase of the original price. So, the perfume was priced for $1200 + $120 = $1320. Then, 15% of the new price is $1320 x 15 / 100 = $198. So, the final price is now $1320 - $198 = $1122. Therefore, the final price is $1200 - $1122 = $78 lower than the original price. The answer is 78.
Q: A tank with a capacity of 8000 gallons is 3/4 full. Daxton empty's the tank by 40% of the total volume of water in the tank to water his vegetable farm. He then fills the tank with 30% of the volume of water remaining in the tank. Calculate the final volume of water in the tank.
A: The volume of water that is in the tank initially is 3 / 4 * 8000 = 6000 gallons. When Daxton empties 40% of the water, he pumps out 40 / 100 * 6000 = 2400 gallons of water. The total volume of water remaining in the tank is 6000 - 2400 = 3600 gallons. Daxton then fills the tank with 30 / 100 * 3600 = 1080 gallons of water. The final volume of water in the tank is 3600 + 1080 = 4680 gallons. The answer is 4680.
