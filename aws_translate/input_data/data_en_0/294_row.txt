The Royalists, led by King Charles I, failed to take Redbridge, Southampton, in March 1644 during the English Civil War (1642-1651). The war was fought by the Royalists, who supported King Charles I, and the Parliamentarians, who favored a more prominent role for the parliament in governing the nation, led by Oliver Cromwell.

The English Civil War was a long and bloody conflict that was both politically and religiously driven. In 1644, the Royalists and the Parliamentarians were fighting for control over England, and the tide of the war was constantly shifting. In late 1643, King Charles I launched a campaign to regain control of the Southern and Western regions of England, which would ensure he had direct access to the important trading ports.

The King's plan was to surround the Parliamentarian strongholds in between the Royalist-controlled territories. The campaign began with the Royalist force led by Prince Maurice, the King's nephew, moving to retake the South-Eastern port town of Redbridge. Redbridge was a strategic location, as it contained an important bridge that provided access to the Southampton port.

In March 1644, the Royalists approached Redbridge, expecting to find an opportunity to take the town easily. However, the Parliamentarians, who were well-aware of the strategic importance of Redbridge, had fortified the town with a strong garrison. Under the command of Captain Richard Norton, they prepared themselves to defend the town against a much larger and better-equipped Royalist force.

As the Royalist forces approached, Norton ordered his men to create barricades by felling trees and piling earth across the approach routes to Redbridge. They set up guard posts at key points to monitor the Royalist's movements and strengthen their defenses. As the Royalists got closer, they were met with a barrage of gunfire from the barricaded Parliamentarians.

Realizing that Redbridge was far more prepared for battle than previously assumed, the Royalist forces hesitated to mount a full-scale assault on the town. They opted for a more cautious approach, trying to analyze the strength and disposition of the defender's position. Meanwhile, the defenders continued to harass and repel the Royalist force's attempts to encircle the town.

Despite several skirmishes and probing attacks, the Royalists were unable to break through the staunch defenses of Redbridge. Eventually, their attempts to capture the town proved futile, and Prince Maurice decided to withdraw his forces and focus on other targets. The failure to take Redbridge hindered King Charles I's plan to reestablish control over Southern England, and it was seen as a significant setback for the Royalists.

In conclusion, the Royalists failed to take Redbridge, Southampton, in March 1644, due to the strong Parliamentarian defense and the determination of Captain Richard Norton and his men to protect the town. This event was part of the larger and tumultuous English Civil War, demonstrating the strategic importance of even small towns and the impact they could have on the overall outcome of the conflict.
