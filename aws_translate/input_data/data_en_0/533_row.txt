[Question]Martha needs to paint all four walls in her 12 foot by 16 foot kitchen, which has 10 foot high ceilings. Each wall needs one coat of primer and two coats of paint. If Martha can paint 40 square feet per hour, how many hours will it take her to paint the kitchen?
[Answer]There are two walls that are 12' X 10' and two walls that are 16' by 10'. First find the size in square feet of one 12' x 10' wall by multiplying the height and length: 12 ft * 10 ft = 120 sq ft. Multiply that quantity by 2 since there are two 12' x 10' walls: 120 sq ft * 2 = 240 sq ft. Then find the size in square feet of one 16' x 10' wall by multiplying the height and length: 16 ft * 10 ft = 160 sq ft. Multiply that quantity by 2 since there are two 16' x 10' walls: 160 sq ft * 2 = 320 sq ft. Now add the square footage of both sets of walls to find the total square footage Martha needs to paint: 240 sq ft + 320 sq ft = 560 sq ft. Now multiply that amount by 3 because Martha needs to add 3 coats: 560 sq ft / coat * 3 coats = 1680 sq ft. Finally, divide the total square footage by Martha's painting rate to find how many hours she needs to finish: 1680 sq ft / 40 sq ft / hour = 42 hours. The answer is 42.
Q: Eunice has 10 eggplant seeds and 4 pots. How many seeds will be planted in the fourth pot if 3 seeds can be planted in 1 pot?
A: Eunice can plant a total of 3 pots x 3 seeds = 9 seeds in three pots. So, only 10 - 9 = 1 eggplant seed will be planted in the fourth pot. The answer is 1.
Question: Bob and Kate went to a restaurant for dinner. After they were done eating the waitress gave a $30 bill to Bob and a $25 bill to Kate, but told them they were eligible for special discounts; 5% for Bob, 2% for Kate. Considering the discounts, how much do they have to pay in total?
Answer: 5% of $30 is (5 / 100) * 30 = $1.5. The dollar amount of Bob's discount is $1.5 so he will pay $30 - $1.5 = $28.5. 2% of $25 is (2 / 100) * $25 = $0.5. The dollar amount of Kate's discount is $0.5 so she will pay $25 - $0.5 = $24.5. Altogether they will pay $28.5 + $24.5 = $53. The answer is 53.
[Question]Ten boys brought 15 popsicle sticks each. Twelve girls brought 12 popsicle sticks each. How many fewer popsicle sticks did the girls bring than the boys?
[Answer]The boys brought a total of 10 x 15 = 150 popsicle sticks. The girls brought a total of 12 x 12 = 144 popsicle sticks. Therefore, the girls brought 150 - 144 = 6 fewer popsicle sticks than the boys. The answer is 6.
Q: A pie shop charges $3 per slice of custard pie. They cut each whole pie into 10 slices. If they make 6 whole custard pies, how much money will the pie shop earn?
A: The pie shop has 6 x 10 = 60 slices of custard pie. Therefore, the pie shop will earn $3 x 60 = $180 for the 60 slices of custard pie. The answer is 180.
