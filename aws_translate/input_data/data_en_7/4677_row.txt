Question: Bill needs to soak his clothes for 4 minutes to get rid of each grass stain and 7 additional minutes to get rid of each marinara stain. If his clothes have 3 grass stains and 1 marinara stain, how long does he need to soak them?
Answer: First find the total soaking time to get rid of the grass stains: 4 minutes / stain * 3 stains = 12 minutes. Then add the soak time for the marinara to find the total soak time: 12 minutes + 7 minutes = 19 minutes. The answer is 19.
[Question]Tony tries to drink more water, so he has been tracking how much water he drinks. Yesterday, he drank 48 ounces of water, which is 4% less than what he drank two days ago. How much water did Tony drink two days ago?
[Answer]Tony drank yesterday 100% - 4% = 96% of what he drank two days ago. Since 96% is 48 ounces, then every 1% is equal to 48 / 96 = 0.5 ounces of water. So, Tony drank 0.5 x 100 = 50 ounces two days ago. The answer is 50.
Q: Denny is planning to build a modular home. A 400 square foot Kitchen module costs $20000 and a 150 square foot bathroom module costs $12,000. All other modules cost $100 per square foot. If Denny plans to build a 2,000 square foot modular home containing one kitchen and two bathrooms, how much will it cost, in dollars?
A: The kitchen and two bathroom modules will take up 400 + 150 + 150 = 700 sq. ft. of the 2000 sq. ft. of space. Thus, the remaining modular space is 2000 - 700 = 1300 sq. ft. Cost of the kitchens and bathrooms is $20,000 + $12,000 + $12,000 = $44,000. The cost of the other 1300 sq. ft. of space is 1300 * $100 = $130,000. In total, the cost of the complete 2000 sq.ft. modular home with one kitchen and two bathrooms is $44,000 + $130,000 = $174,000. The answer is 174000.
Question: Aryan owes Fernanda $1200, which is twice what Kyro owes Fernanda. Aryan decides to pay 60% of her debt to Fernanda, and Kyro pays Fernanda 80% of her dept. If Fernanda had $300 in her savings account and adds the money she's been paid by her debtors to the savings account, calculate the total amount of money in her savings account now.
Answer: Kyro owes Fernanda half of what Aryan owes Fernanda, a total of 1 / 2 * $1200 = $600. Aryan pays 60% of her dept, which equals 60 / 100 * 1200 = $720. If Fernanda adds the amount she's been paid by Aryan to her savings account, it increases to $300 + $720 = $1020. Kyro also pays her debt by 80 / 100 * $600 = $480. When Fernanda adds the amount she's been paid by Kyro to her savings account, the total amount of money in the savings account increases to $1020 + $480 = $1500. The answer is 1500.
