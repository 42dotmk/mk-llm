Question: Robi Ney wants to fill a 120-liter tub. He is amused by letting the water run for 1 minute, then closing the water supply for 1 minute, and so on alternating opening and closing the water supply. But the cap at the bottom of the tub is not very airtight and lets 1 liter of water escape per minute. The flow rate of the tap is 12 liters per minute. How long does it take to fill the tub in minutes?
Answer: In 2 minutes, 12 liters of water flow into the bathtub and 2 liters (2 minutes x 1 liter / minute ) escape. This will leave 12 â€“ 2 = 10 liters of water every two minutes. We can divide the number of liters by the number of minutes to find the average flow per minute, which is 10 / 2 = 5 liters per minute. To fill the tub, it will take 120 liters / 5 liters / min = 24 min. The answer is 24.
[Question]To pass the time while she is waiting somewhere Carla likes to count things around her. While she is waiting for school to start on Monday she counts the tiles on the ceiling--38. While she is waiting for everyone to finish their tests after she has handed in hers, she counts the books in the room--75. On Tuesday Carla counts all the tiles twice in a row and she counts the books three times in a row when she has to wait for a long time for the teacher to finish handing out the graded tests. If every time Carla counts something counts as once, how many times has Carla counted something on Tuesday?
[Answer]When Carla was waiting on Monday she counted 38 ceiling tiles and on Tuesday she counted them twice, 38 ceiling tiles x 2 = 76 times she counted a ceiling tile. She also counted 75 books in the room on Monday and counted them three times in a row on Tuesday, 75 books x 3 = 225 times she counted a book. On Tuesday Carla counted the ceiling tiles 76 times + counted books 225 times = 301 times Carla counted something on Tuesday. The answer is 301.
Q: Earl started delivering newspapers on the first floor of a condominium building. He then went up 5 floors then went down 2 floors. He again went up 7 floors and found that he is 9 floors away from the top of the building. How many floors does the building have?
A: Earl was on the 1 + 5 = 6th floor after going up 5 floors. When he went down 2 floors, he was on the 6 - 2 = 4th floor. Since he went up 7 floors, he was then on the 4 + 7 = 11th floor. Since he is 9 floors away from the top of the building, therefore the building has 11 + 9 = 20 floors. The answer is 20.
Question: Randy had $3,000. Smith gave him another $200. Randy then gave Sally $1,200 and kept the rest. What was the value, in dollars, of the rest?
