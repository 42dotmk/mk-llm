Q: Village Foods sells good food at a fair price. Their specialty is fresh vegetables. If they get 500 customers per month, and each customer purchases 2 heads of lettuce for $1 each and 4 tomatoes for $0.5 apiece, then how much money, in dollars, will the store receive in sales of lettuce and tomatoes per month?
A: 2 heads of lettuce at $1 apiece is 2 * $1 = $2. 4 tomatoes at $0.50 apiece is 4 * $0.5 = $2. Thus, each customer purchases $2 + $2 = $4 in lettuce and tomatoes per month. Therefore, if 500 customers per month spend $4 on lettuce and tomatoes, then the store will receive $4 * 500 = $2000 per month on sales of lettuce and tomatoes. The answer is 2000.
Question: Joey wants to buy the latest released pair of designer High Jump basketball sneakers. He plans to mow 3 neighbors’ lawns for $8 a lawn, sell 2 collectible figures to his friends for $9 each, and work an after-school job for 10 hours at $5 per hour. If his earnings just cover the price of the High Jump sneakers, how much do the shoes cost?
Answer: Joey will earn 3 * $8 = $24 mowing his neighbors’ lawns. He will earn 2 * $9 = $18 selling his collectable figures. He will earn 10 * $5 = $50 at his after - school job. The sneakers cost $24 + $18 + $50 = $92. The answer is 92.
[Question]Lao is farming chickens. He can sell each chicken for $1.50. A bag of chicken feed weighs 20 pounds and costs $2. Each chicken will need 2 pounds of feed from the time it hatches to the time he sells it. If he makes $65 profit from selling chickens, how many did he sell?
[Answer]A bag of feed is enough for 10 chickens because 20 / 2 = 10. Each chicken costs $.2 to raise because 2 / 10 = .2. Each chicken results in $1.3 of profit because 1.5 - .2 = 1.3. He sells 50 chickens because 65 / 1.3 = 50. The answer is 50.
Q: Utopia National Park hosted 30,000 elephants on Friday night. The next morning, there was a 4-hour elephant exodus out of the park, at a constant rate of 2,880 elephants/hour. Over the next 7-hour period, new elephants entered the park at a constant rate. If the final number of elephants in the park was 28,980, at what rate did the new elephants enter the park?
A: The Saturday morning exodus out of the park comprised 4 * 2880 = 11520 elephants. This means that after the exodus, the park was left with 30000 - 11520 = 18480 elephants. Since the final number of elephants was 28,980, the new elephants that entered were 28980 - 18480 = 10500. The rate at which the new elephants entered the park was therefore 10500 / 7 = 1500 elephants / hour. The answer is 1500.
Question: Mara and Riley went to a carnival, Mara rode the bumper car two times, Riley rode the space shuttle four times, and they both rode the Ferris wheel three times. If a ticket for a bumper car cost $2, a ticket for a space shuttle cost $4, and a ticket for a Ferris wheel cost $5, how much money did they spend?
Answer: Mara spent $2 x 2 = $4 for riding the bumper car two times. Riley spent $4 x 4 = $16 for riding the space shuttle 4 times. They spent $5 x 3 = $15 each riding the Ferris wheel 3 times. So, they spent a total of $15 x 2 = $30 riding the Ferris wheel. Therefore the total amount they spent at the carnival is $4 + $16 + $30 = $50. The answer is 50.
