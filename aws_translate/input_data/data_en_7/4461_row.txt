The first amateur draft was held in 1965. Unlike most sports drafts, the first-year player draft is held mid-season, in June. Another distinguishing feature of this draft in comparison with those of other North American major professional sports leagues is its sheer size: under the current collective bargaining agreement the draft lasts 40 rounds, plus compensatory picks. In contrast, the NFL draft lasts for seven rounds (a maximum of 256 selections), the NHL entry draft lasts seven rounds and roughly 215 picks, and the NBA draft lasts for only two rounds (60 selections).

Context: The normal blood glucose level (tested while fasting) for non-diabetics, should be between 3.9 and 5.5 mmol / L (70 to 100 mg / dL). The mean normal blood glucose level in humans is about 5.5 mmol / L (100 mg / dL); however, this level fluctuates throughout the day. Blood sugar levels for those without diabetes and who are not fasting should be below 6.9 mmol / L (125 mg / dL). The blood glucose target range for diabetics, according to the American Diabetes Association, should be 5.0 -- 7.2 mmol / l (90 -- 130 mg / dL) before meals, and less than 10 mmol / L (180 mg / dL) after meals (as measured by a blood glucose monitor).

Question: what is the normal percentage of sugar level in the body?
