[Question]Ali has a store that sells fruits and vegetables. He puts 23 kg of kidney apples, 37 kg of golden apples and 14 kg of Canada apples on the shelves. By noon, 36 kg of apples were sold. What is the mass of apples that he has left?
[Answer]You first have to calculate the total mass of apples he had on the shelves, so you add the three kinds of apples: 23 kg + 37 kg + 14 kg = 74kg. Since he sold 36 kg of apples, he still has: 74 kg – 36 kg = 38kg. The answer is 38.
Q: Parker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy. Daisy is 8 inches taller than Reese. If Reese is 60 inches tall, what is the average height for the three of them?
A: Since Daisy is 6 inches taller than Reese, she must be 60 inches + 8 inches = 68 inches tall. Parker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy, making her 68 inches – 4 inches = 64 inches. The average height of the three of them is (60 inches + 68 inches + 64 inches) / 3 = 64 inches. The answer is 64.
Question: Judy uses 10 pencils during her 5 day school week. A 30 pack of pencils costs $4. How much will she spend on pencils over 45 days?
Answer: She uses 2 pencils a day because 10 / 5 = 2. She will use 90 pencils in 45 days because 2 x 45 = 90. She will need 3 packs of pencils because 90 / 30 = 3. She will spend $12 because 3 x 4 = 12. The answer is 12.
[Question]Hasan is packing up his apartment because he’s moving across the country for a new job. He needs to ship several boxes to his new home. The movers have asked that Hasan avoid putting more than a certain weight in pounds in any cardboard box. The moving company has helpfully provided Hasan with a digital scale that will alert him if a package is too heavy. Hasan is in the kitchen, and he fills a cardboard box with 38 dinner plates. When he checks the box, the scale reports his box is too heavy. Hasan knows each of his plates weighs 10 ounces. He removes a single plate from the box and checks the movers’ scale again. The scale reports his box is still too heavy. Hasan repeats the process again and again. When he has removed enough plates, the movers’ scale shows the box is now an acceptable weight for shipping. Hasan deduces that each shipping box can hold 20 pounds before the scale says the box is too heavy. How many plates did Hasan need to remove from the shipping box?
[Answer]Let x be the number of plates removed from the box. Hasan figured out the movers' weight limit was 20 pounds. Since a pound is equal to 16 ounces, each box can hold 20 * 16, or 320 ounces. Each plate weighs 10 ounces, so the weight of the plates in the box after Hasan removes enough plates to satisfy the movers' weight limit is (38 - x) * 10 ounces. Since these two values are equal, we can write the equation (38 - x) * 10 = 320. Dividing both sides by 10 leaves 38 - x = 32. Adding x to both sides gives 38 – x + x = 32 + x, or, 38 = 32 + x. Subtracting 32 from both sides gives the value of x, which is the number of plates removed from the box, 38 - 32 = 32 + x – 32, or, 6 = x. The answer is 6.
Q: If we assume all thirty 4-wheel drive cars in the parking lot have their spare tire with them, how many tires are in the parking lot?
A: Each car has 4 tires + 1 spare = 5 tires. If there are 30 cars in the parking lot and each one has 5 tires, then the total number of tires is 30 * 5 = 150 tires. The answer is 150.
