Article: This method is sometimes called "the traditional method." It involves adding the numbers in units of single digits, then by units of tens, then by units of hundreds. This is accomplished by working from right to left.Start by adding the figures 383 + 412 + 122.  Draw a line below the numbers. This line is equivalent to the equal sign in linear math. You will write your final sum below this line, starting on the right and moving to the left. Careful placement of each number is essential in this method. Make sure you are careful to place each number directly below the one above it.  That is, 3, 1, and 2 should each be in a column of their own - these are the single digits. 8, 2, and 2 should be in a column - these are the units of tens. 3, 4, and 1 should be in a column - these are the hundreds. You may wish to use graph paper to help you keep your lines straight. Beginning learners may even draw templates of horizontal rows and vertical columns to practice lining their numbers up correctly. Add these numbers, and write the sum directly below this column, below the line. In the example above, adding 3 + 2 + 2 = 7. Write the 7 below the line.  You can also choose to add these numbers individually: 3 + 2 = 5. 5 + 2 = 7. Add the number from the next column to the left. In our example, this would be 8 + 1 + 2. Continue working in this way from right to left until all numbers are added. It is the same sequence no matter how many columns of numbers you have. You can have as few as two columns, and as many as your page will hold. It is also the same sequence no matter how many numbers are in your columns. Use this sequence to add any two or more large numbers. If the sum is more than one digit, you will need to "carry" the extra digit. This means that you will need to add an additional number into the next column to the left.  You easily do this by writing a small number one to the top of your next column. This is called "showing your work." For example, add the sum 982 + 247 + 475, then draw a line beneath. Using the right-to-left method, add 2 + 7 + 5. The sum is 14. Write the 4 beneath the line on the right side as the sum, and write a small number 1 above the next column to the left. When you are adding the next column, simply include the additional 1 as a part of your sum. For example, the next column would be the equation 8 + 4 + 7 (+1) = 20. Write the 0 below the line, and write the 2 above the next column to the left. Your next column will now read: 9 + 2 + 4 (+2). Add these numbers. Because there is no additional column, you can now write your sum entire, whether it's one digit or two. In this case, the sum is 17. Look at the sum now written below the line: 1704. This is your total. This process can be done either mentally or on paper, and consists of rearranging the digits you're adding for easier arithmetic.This technique works well when adding long columns of numbers.  Either mentally or with a pencil, go down the vertical column of numbers you need to add, and group them into units of 10. For instance, in the vertical column 9 + 3 + 7 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 4 + 1, you can find three units of 10 (3 + 7, 2 + 4 + 4, 9 + 1) with 7 left. Therefore, your sum of this single column will be 37. If you have a second vertical column, write the 7 at the base of the right column, and carry the 3. Repeat this process until all columns have been added.
