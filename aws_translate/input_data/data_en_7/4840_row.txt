Q: Shawn collected 40 plain pebbles. He painted 9 pebbles red and 13 pebbles blue. He then divided the remaining pebbles equally into 3 groups, and painted them purple, yellow, and green. What is the difference between the number of blue and yellow pebbles?
A: After painting the red and blue pebbles, Shawn had a remainder of 40 - 9 - 13 = 18 pebbles. He painted 18 / 3 = 6 pebbles yellow. The difference between the number of blue and yellow pebbles is 13 - 6 = 7. The answer is 7.
Question: There were 50 candies left in a bowl after Shelly ate 20 candies the previous week. Her friend comes over, bringing twice as much candy as she originally had. Shelly adds this to the bowl and they decide to divide them equally. How much candy did her friend have after eating 10 of her candies?
Answer: The total number of candies Shelley had before eating some is 50 + 20 = 70 candies. When her friend came over, she brought 2 * 70 = 140 candies. The total number of candies in the bowl is now 140 + 50 = 190 candies. When they divide this equally between them, each gets 190 / 2 = 95 candies. When Shellyâ€™s friend eats 10 of her candies, she still has 95 - 10 = 85 candies. The answer is 85.

Q: Last month, a factory made 12000 dolls and their associated accessories. The accessories for each doll included 2 shoes, 3 bags, 1 set of cosmetics, and 5 hats. If each doll took 45 seconds to make and each accessory took 10 seconds to make, what was the total combined machine operation time, in seconds, required to manufacture all of the dolls and their accessories?
A: The number of shoes the factory made was 12000 dolls x 2 shoes / doll = 24000 shoes. The factory also made for each doll 12000 dolls x 3 bags / doll = 36000 bags. The set of cosmetics made for each doll was just one, so there are 12000 cosmetics sets. Finally, the number of hats for the dolls was 12000 dolls x 5 hats / doll = 60000 hats. In total, the number of accessories was 24000 + 36000 + 12000 + 60000 = 132000 accessories. The dolls took in total 12000 dolls x 45 seconds / doll = 540000 seconds to be made. All the accessories also took 132000 accessories x 10 seconds / accessory = 1320000 seconds. Combing both results, we have that the total time the machinery was working was 1320000 + 540000 = 1860000 seconds. The answer is 1860000.
