Title: "Enchanted Summons"

Derek, a down-to-earth, pragmatic lawyer in a bustling city, lives a routine life filled with case files, courtrooms, and regulation court battles. One odd day, he receives a mysterious, gilded summons in the mail. The craftmanship is peculiarly old-world, and the language in the summons appears to be some ancient, arcane script which he can't identify, but for some reason, he can understand it clearly. The summons was from the Fairy Realm, a concept that is utterly ridiculous to his logical mind. 

The summons outlines that he has been chosen to represent a client from their world - Queen Titania, the Fairy Queen, who is facing a wrongful dethronement lawsuit in the Fairy Realm. Derek brushes it off as a well-orchestrated prank - until it happens again, and this time with a fairy, Astoria, effectively startling him in his office, confirming the summons' authenticity.

Astoria, a fearless fairy lawyer working under Titania, manages to convince a bemused and bewildered Derek to embark on this extraordinary journey into the Fairy Realm - a world unbeknownst to most humans, brimming with wonder, magic, and dilemmas quite unlike human ones. Derek is skeptical and incredulous, causing both comedic and conflict-filled situations, but the commitment to his profession compels him to see this through. 

He wades through the labyrinth of fairy laws, their intricacies, and the astonishing magic-infused courtrooms, where he butts heads with Oberon, the Fairy King, who has initiated the lawsuit against Titania, his own wife. It's a high-stakes case, where the political structure, history, and future of the Fairy Realm lie delicately balanced. There are underlying threads of rebellion, manipulation, and deceit, all leading back to the duplicitous group of power-hungry fairies trying to overthrow Titania. 

Complementing the legal battle, Derek's character experiences an arc of growing from a rigid, often dismissive person, to someone who learns to appreciate magic, the unexplainable, and learning to trust his intuition. His dynamic with Astoria, who herself learns about the rigidity and structure of human laws from him, showcases a beautiful cultural and professional exchange.

In the climax, Derek skillfully uses his logic, human wit, combined with fairy laws and magic taught by Astoria, to dismantle the accusations at the trial. The truth unfolds shockingly in the court, proving Queen Titania's innocence and unmasking the traitors among the court. Derek's successful defense restores Titania to her rightful throne, peace in the Fairy Realm, and the perpetrators are justly punished. 

Derek returns to his world, changed, humbled, and promising to keep the secret of the Fairy Realm. This whole unusual journey changes his perspective, not just on his profession but on life as well. His successful defense in the Fairy Realm makes him a fairy-tale legend, unbeknown to his human counterparts. However, in his heart, he now holds an irreplaceable respect for the Fae world and a secret ally in Astoria. The routine life he formerly led now glimmers with the enchanting remnants of his journey. 

The movie closes on Derek in his regular life with a knowing smile, hinting at the unseen adventures he had, redefining the world he knew. As confusing as the summons had appeared in the beginning, he is now grateful for being a part of the Fairy Realm, if only for a short while.
