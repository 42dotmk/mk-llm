Plot:

In the bustling city of Nuevapolis, the expansive forest park named "The Forbidden Terrain" has been declared off-limits by the city authorities due to a series of mysterious occurrences and strange sightings. People who ventured into the park have gone missing, never to be seen again, while others return with tales of ghostly apparitions and unnatural happenings. The residents have all heard about the chilling stories, but none dare to venture inside. The city officials have denied any reports of supernatural occurrences and have stated that the park is closed due to ongoing renovation and preservation projects.

Our protagonist, John Hart, is an eager, aspiring investigative journalist seeking an opportunity to make his name in the field of journalism. He comes across a strange file on his late father's computer, which sparks his interest in the Forbidden Terrain. His father, a former respected journalist, had archived a collection of documents hinting at a clandestine project underway in the forest park. Intrigued, John sets out to unravel the mystery behind the Forbidden Terrain, but to do so, he needs permission to enter the restricted area.

John manages to track down the aloof James Treadwell, the Commissioner of Public Lands, who has the authority to grant a special permit to access the park. He pleads his case before the Commissioner, sharing his father's findings and expressing his belief that something unusual is happening in the forest. The Commissioner, taken aback by John's persistence and the strength of the evidence, decides to grant him a temporary permit.

With the permit secured, John begins his investigation. As he delves deeper into the forest, he encounters several challenges, including trespassing local gangs, treacherous terrain, and the appearance of inexplicable supernatural phenomena. However, in the heart of the forest, he discovers an abandoned, underground facility that appears to be the hub of all the strange happenings. The facility, run by a covert government organization called "The Enclave," is conducting experiments on human subjects using advanced, unregulated technology in a bid to develop psychic abilities for military use.

John captures video footage of the facility and its ongoing experiments, planning to expose the horrific truth to the world. However, his actions attract the attention of The Enclave's ruthless security forces, led by enigmatic Commander Stern. With his life in danger and the evidence in his possession, John is forced to make a daring escape from the forest park, narrowly evading capture.

In a thrilling finale, John returns to the city with the evidence he has collected, making his way to the Commissioner's office and revealing the truth behind The Forbidden Terrain. Together, they inform the public about the secret government program operating in the park, sparking a massive scandal that leads to the dissolution of The Enclave and the arrest of its key operatives.

Ultimately, John's determination and courage result in the reopening of the Forbidden Terrain, and he establishes himself as a prominent investigative journalist. He dedicates his expos√© to his late father, who had unknowingly set the stage for unraveling the shadowy truth under the guise of a simple question - "Where did he get the permit from?"
