(5). Mutagenic chemicals

Given the two facts provided, the answer to the question – "what may change the structure of a nucleotide?" – is mutagenic chemicals. To properly understand how mutagenic chemicals can change the structure of nucleotides, let’s first explore what nucleotides and mutations are and then discuss the role of mutagenic chemicals in this process.

A nucleotide is the basic building block of nucleic acids, which make up the genetic material in living organisms – DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid). These molecules are composed of three components: a sugar (deoxyribose in DNA or ribose in RNA), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. There are four different nitrogenous bases in DNA: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). In RNA, uracil (U) replaces thymine. The specific sequence of these bases in DNA and RNA forms the genetic code that dictates cell functions and the characteristics of the organism.

Now let’s explore mutations. A mutation is an alteration in the sequence of nucleotides that occurs spontaneously or as a result of exposure to certain environmental factors (such as mutagenic chemicals). Mutations can be of two types:

1. Chromosomal mutations: These affect the structure of the chromosome itself, changing the arrangement and organization of genes within the chromosomes. Examples include deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations.
2. Point mutations: These involve a change in a single nucleotide. Examples include substitutions, insertions, and deletions of individual bases.

Mutagenic chemicals (Fact 2) are substances that increase the rate of genetic mutations by altering the structure and functionality of nucleotides present in the DNA and RNA molecules. These chemicals can interact with the genetic material either directly or indirectly, causing changes in the nitrogenous bases and the DNA or RNA backbone. The mechanisms by which mutagenic chemicals cause these changes include:

1. Chemical modification of the bases: Mutagenic chemicals can form covalent bonds with the nitrogenous bases, resulting in altered structure and function. For example, alkylating agents can add an alkyl group to the nitrogenous bases, altering the pairing properties and leading to mistakes during DNA replication.
2. Base damage: Some mutagenic chemicals can cause oxidative damage to the nitrogenous bases, for example, through oxidation reactions (Choice 1). These reactions can lead to the formation of unstable and reactive molecules called free radicals, which can, in turn, damage the DNA base pairs.
3. Intercalation: Mutagenic chemicals can insert themselves between adjacent base pairs, causing distortions in DNA or RNA structure. This can lead to problems in processes such as DNA replication, transcription, and translation, potentially causing frameshift mutations.
4. Crosslinking: Certain mutagenic chemicals can form covalent bonds between adjacent bases on the same or opposite DNA strands, leading to the formation of crosslinks that impede replication and transcription processes.

In conclusion, the correct answer to the question – "what may change the structure of a nucleotide?" – is mutagenic chemicals (Choice 5). These chemicals play a significant role in inducing genetic mutations by either altering the structure of entire chromosomes or changing single nucleotides within the DNA and RNA molecules.
