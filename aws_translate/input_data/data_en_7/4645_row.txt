Patricia knew nothing about how to use makeup, so Mary taught them because she recognized that Patricia had lacked confidence in her appearance for a long time, and as a close friend, Mary wanted to help her regain her self-esteem and empower her to embrace her unique beauty.

As they started their makeup lessons, Mary began by sharing the basics of skincare, explaining the importance of prepping the skin before makeup application and the necessity of maintaining a healthy daily cleansing routine. She emphasized the significance of using gentle cleansers, toners, and moisturizers according to Patricia's skin type, describing the numerous benefits associated with regular exfoliation, including the removal of dead skin cells and the promotion of cell renewal.

Next, Mary introduced Patricia to color science and makeup theory. She discussed the concept of the color wheel and its use for makeup application, illustrating the difference between complementary and analogous colors, and highlighting the best ways to select eyeshadow shades that would enhance Patricia's natural eye color and bring more depth to her features. As they continued to explore, they delved into the many techniques for blending and contouring makeup to achieve various looks, such as natural, dramatic, or avant-garde styles.

In the course of their lessons, Patricia gradually began to recognize her facial features' uniqueness and appreciate the endless possibilities that makeup could provide to accentuate and complement her individual characteristics. They experimented with various lip colors, from bold matte lipsticks to shimmering glosses, finding those that suited her complexion and personality best.

Moreover, Mary wanted Patricia to feel comfortable with makeup application, so she made sure to teach her the correct order of applying makeup products, starting with primer and foundation, followed by concealer, and moving on to powder, blush, and highlighter. As Patricia became more adept in applying makeup, Mary taught her how to accentuate her eyes by using eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara in ways that enhanced their shape and size, making them appear more expressive and captivating.

Mary also emphasized the importance of using high-quality makeup brushes for a smoother and more professional application. She explained how different brush sizes and shapes were used for different purposes, guiding Patricia through the selection process and teaching her the proper techniques for maintaining and cleaning her brushes to ensure the longevity of the products.

While helping Patricia explore the world of makeup, Mary also managed to instill in her friend the value of self-care and nurturing a positive self-image that went beyond cosmetics. As Patricia's confidence grew, she began to understand that external appearances were only part of the equation - true beauty came from within, and it was essential to cultivate self-love, acceptance, and compassion for herself just as much as she did for others.

Over time, the bond between Mary and Patricia only grew stronger, with makeup becoming not just a shared passion but also a symbol of their friendship built on trust, understanding, and genuine care for one another's well-being. Through the transformative power of makeup, they discovered the significance of allowing their natural beauty and inner light to shine through, inspiring others around them to do the same.
