At a glance, the two questions may appear to have a similar meaning, but upon closer examination, we can notice a subtle distinction between them. The first question asks why there are only a few people born transgender, while the second question inquires into how transgender people are born. Let's address each question in detail:

1) Why are few people born transgender?

The underlying reason only a few people are born transgender primarily lies in the multifaceted nature of gender identity, which is influenced by biological, psychological, and social factors. The term "transgender" speaks to an individual whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth.

The exact cause of being transgender is not completely understood, and it is thought to involve an interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences. Research has shown that several genes play a role in the development of gender identity. Similarly, hormonal factors (especially during prenatal development) are considered vital in shaping one's gender identity.

Nonetheless, the prevalence of transgender individuals is subject to the survey methods used to gather data and the societal openness to transgender issues. Up-to-date studies suggest that approximately 0.5% - 1.2% of the population identifies as transgender. It is essential to consider that many transgender individuals may remain unidentified due to factors such as social stigma, discrimination, and lack of awareness or understanding.

2) How are transgender people born?

As mentioned earlier, no single cause can sufficiently explain why some people are born transgender. It is typically attributed to a combination of various genetic, hormonal, and environmental components. Here are some factors that experts believe could play a role:

- Genetic factors: Studies have found a potential link between specific genes (like those involved in hormone metabolism) and the likelihood of being transgender. It is suggested that genetic predispositions might interact with other factors to impact an individual's gender identity.

- Hormonal factors: Hormones such as testosterone and estrogen play a crucial role in the development of fetal sexual characteristics. In some cases, prenatal exposure to atypical hormone levels may affect the fetus's gender identity development. This theory suggests that transgender individuals may experience a mismatch between their assigned sex at birth and their gender identity due to hormonal variations during critical stages of fetal brain development.

- Environmental factors: Some experts believe that the environment, both in the womb and during formative years, can influence the development of gender dysphoria (a condition in which there is a conflict between a person's physical or assigned gender and the gender with which they identify). These factors may include cultural and societal norms, family dynamics, and individual experiences.

In conclusion, while the two questions discussed do address the same subject, they focus on different aspects of the transgender experience. The first question looks into the prevalence of transgender individuals, while the second question seeks to explain the factors involved in the development of transgender identity. Researchers are still working to uncover the various influences that shape gender identity, and our understanding of the subject continues to evolve.
