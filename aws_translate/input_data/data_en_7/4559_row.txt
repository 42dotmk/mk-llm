No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. The first question seeks information about the meaning of 'Architect Grade A' and the process of obtaining Grade A certification in Architecture in Qatar. The second question is about the perception of lower-grade architecture students in the job market.

To address the first question:

'Architect Grade A' refers to a classification system used in some countries to evaluate and categorize the professional competence of architects. In Qatar, a Grade A Architect is a highly qualified professional who has demonstrated a high level of proficiency, expertise, and experience in the field of architecture.

To become a Grade A certified architect in Qatar, here is a general outline of the steps you need to follow:

1. Education: Obtain a bachelor's or master's degree in architecture from a recognized institution. It is crucial to note that the specific academic requirements may vary depending on the local regulatory body's standards in Qatar.

2. Professional Experience: Gain relevant work experience in architecture through internships, work placements, or full-time employment. Usually, several years of practical experience are required before one can apply for Grade A certification.

3. Licensing Exam: Prepare and successfully pass the local licensing examination, often administered by a regulatory body like the Urban Planning and Development Authority (UPDA), to ensure that candidates meet Qatar's professional and technical standards.

4. Continuing Professional Development (CPD): Engage in ongoing learning and professional development courses to stay up-to-date with industry trends, regulations, and advancements in the field of architecture.

5. Application Process: Submit an application for Grade A certification to the relevant regulatory body, including your education and experience credentials, along with any other required documentation.

Now, to address the second question:

Lower grade architecture students or professionals may face certain challenges when entering the job market, especially when compared to their Grade A counterparts. The perception of lower-grade architects can vary, but some common themes include:

1. Limited job opportunities: Graduates with lower grades or less experience may find fewer job openings available to them, as firms often favor more experienced and highly-graded professionals.

2. Lower salaries and benefits: The remuneration package offered to lower-grade architects is likely to be less competitive than what their Grade A counterparts receive.

3. Slower career growth: Lower grade architects may experience slower career progression and may need to put in considerable effort and time to prove their competency and stand out from their more highly-graded peers.

4. Perception issues: Unfortunately, lower-grade architects may sometimes be perceived as less competent or skilled compared to their higher-grade counterparts, even if this is not necessarily the case. Overcoming this perception may require demonstrating strong work ethics, dedication, and a commitment to professional growth.

It is essential for lower-grade architecture professionals to focus on developing their skills, gaining practical experience, and participating in continuing education courses to enhance their employability and increase their chances of career success in the competitive job market.
