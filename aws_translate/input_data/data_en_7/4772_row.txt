Q: A man decides to try and do everything off his bucket list while he is still young and fit enough to finish it all. One of his goals was to climb the seven summits. He realizes first he has to get in shape to do it and it takes him 2 years of working out to get healthy enough to take up mountain climbing. He then spends twice that long learning how to be a technically proficient mountain climber. After that he starts with the simplest mountain on the list and climbs them all. He spends 5 months climbing each mountain. After that he takes 13 months learning to dive and dives through all the caves he wants in 2 years. How much time did it take to get through all these goals?
A: He spent 2 * 2 = 4 years learning to climb. He spends 5 * 7 = 35 months climbing all 7 mountains. After a 13 month break, he starts diving so that is 35 + 13 = 48 months. That means it is 48 / 12 = 4 years. So in total it all took 2 + 4 + 4 + 2 = 12 years. The answer is 12.
Question: Travis and his brother joined a trick-or-treat event. They collected 68 pieces of candy altogether. Each of them ate 4 pieces of candy after the event. How many pieces of candy were left?
Answer: They ate a total of 4 x 2 = 8 pieces of candy after the event. So, Travis and his brother have 68 - 8 = 60 pieces of candy left. The answer is 60.
[Question]A rectangular plot of private property is fenced in by a chain-link fence. The long sides of the plot are three times the length of the short sides. One short side of the fence is rusted from being hit by a sprinkler and needs to be replaced. If all the sides of the fence together are 640 feet long, how many feet of fence need to be replaced?
[Answer]Let S be the length of the short side of the fence. Thus, the length of a long side of the fence is 3S. There are 2 of each side, so the whole fence is 2S + 2 * 3S = 2S + 6S = 8S long. The whole fence is 8S = 640 feet long. Thus, the short side of the fence that needs to be replaced is S = 640 / 8 = 80 feet long. The answer is 80.
Q: Jessica just got her driving permit. She must complete 50 hours of driving with a parent to get her driverâ€™s license. It takes 20 minutes to drive to school. If she drives to and from school every day, how many school days will it take Jessica to meet the 50-hour driving requirement?
A: Jessica will drive 20 minutes, twice every school day (to and from school), so 20 minutes x 2 trips = 40 minutes each day. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so 50 hours of driving x 60 minutes / hour = 3,000 minutes. If you take the 3,000 minutes she needs to drive / 40 minutes driving each day = 75 school days to drive 50 hours. The answer is 75.
Question: During the outbreak of the coronavirus, a company had to ramp up its toilet paper production three times more to cover the increased demand. If the company was producing 7000 toilet paper per day, calculate its total toilet paper production during March of 2020 after increasing its production.
Answer: If the company was producing 7000 toilet paper per day, when it ramped up its toilet paper production three times per day, it produced 3 * 7000 = 21000 more per day. The total toilet production by the company increased to 7000 + 21000 = 28000. In March, with 31 days, the company produced a total of 28000 * 31 = 868000 toilet papers. The answer is 868000.
