Question: Fran baked 50 red macaroons and 40 green macarons. How many macaroons will remain if Fran ate 15 green macaroons and twice as many red macaroons as green macaroons?
Answer: After eating 15 green macaroons, the number is reduced to 40 green macaroons - 15 green macaroons = 25 green macaroons. If Fran ate 15 green macaroons, he also ate 2 red / green * 15 green macaroons = 30 red macaroons. The total number of red macaroons remaining is 50 red macaroons - 30 red macaroons = 20 red macaroons. The total number of macaroons Fran has left are 20 macaroons + 25 macaroons = 45 macaroons. The answer is 45.
[Question]Jason is climbing a telephone pole next to a tree his friend Matt is climbing. Matt can climb 6 feet/minute and Jason can climb 12 feet per minute. After 7 minutes, how much higher will Jason be than Matt?
[Answer]First find the distance Matt climbs in 7 minutes: 6 feet / minute * 7 minutes = 42 feet. Then find the distance Jason climbs in 7 minutes: 12 feet / minute * 7 minutes = 84 feet. Then subtract the distance Matt climbs from the distance Jason climbs to find the difference: 84 feet - 42 feet = 42 feet. The answer is 42.
Q: Working together, four pugs can clean their house in 45 minutes. In how many minutes will 15 pugs working together be able to clean their house?
A: If four pugs can clean their house in 45 minutes, one pug will take 4 * 45 = 180 minutes. Since one pug working alone takes 180 minutes to clean the house, fifteen pugs working together will be able to clean their house in 180 / 15 = 12 minutes. The answer is 12.
Question: Gerald brings chocolate bars to school for his class to share. Each bar contains 8 squares. He brings 7 total bars. His teacher says that for every bar he brings, she will bring two more identical ones. There are 24 students in class. How many squares of chocolate does each student get?
Answer: The teacher brings 14 bars to school because 7 x 2 = 14. There are 21 total bars of chocolate because 7 + 14 = 21. There are 168 total squares of chocolate because 21 x 8 = 168. Each student gets 7 squares because 168 / 24 = 7. The answer is 7.
[Question]Jimmy is setting up a garden. He has three plots: one plot for green beans, one plot for carrots, and one plot for corn. Each corn plant produces 5 times as many servings of veggies as each carrot, and each green bean plant produces half as many servings as each corn plant. If each carrot produces 4 servings of vegetables, and each plot has 9 plants, how many servings of vegetables is Jimmy growing?
[Answer]First, find how many servings one corn plant produces by multiplying the number of carrot servings by 5: 4 servings * 5 = 20 servings. Then find how many servings one green bean plant produces by dividing the number of corn servings by two: 20 servings / 2 = 10 servings. Now multiply the number of servings per carrot plant by the number of carrot plants: 4 servings / plant * 9 plants = 36 servings. Do the same for corn: 20 servings / plant * 9 plants = 180 servings. And do the same for green beans: 10 servings / plant * 9 plants = 90 servings. Now add up the servings for all three types of plant: 36 servings + 180 servings + 90 servings = 306 servings. The answer is 306.
