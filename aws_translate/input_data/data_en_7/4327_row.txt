Q: Chad saves 40% of the money he earns/receives in a year. This year, he made $600 mowing yards and received $250.00 for his birthday/holidays. He also made $150.00 by selling some old video games and another $150.00 doing odd jobs. How much will he save?
A: He made $600.00 mowing yards, $250.00 for his birthday, $150.00 selling items and $150.00 doing odd jobs so he made 600 + 250 + 150 + 150 = $1,150.00. He made $1,150.00 and will save 40% so he saves 1150 * .40 = $460.00. The answer is 460.
Question: Annie is trying to figure out whether it's safe to drive her truck. For every 3 degrees the temperature drops below 32 degrees, Annie's chances of skidding on ice increase 5%. If she goes into a skid, she has a 40% of regaining control. Otherwise, she'll have a serious accident. If the temperature is 8 degrees, what is the percentage chance of Annie getting into a serious accident if she drives?
Answer: First find how many degrees below 32 the temperature is: 32 degrees - 8 degrees = 24 degrees. Then divide that amount by the number of degrees per 5% increase in skid risk to find how many 5% increases there are: 24 degrees / 3 degrees / 5% increase = 8 5% increases. Multiply the number of increases by 5% to find the total increase in skid risk: 8 * 5% = 40%. Now find the chance that Annie has a serious accident if she goes into a skid by subtracting the chance she regains control from 100%: 100% - 40% = 60%. Finally, multiply the chance of going into a skid by the chance of having a serious accident after a skid to find the total risk of a serious accident: 60% * 40% = 24%. The answer is 24.
[Question]Niko has bought 9 pairs of socks that cost $2 each and plans to resell them. He wants to gain 25% profit from four of the pairs of socks and $0.2 profit each for the other 5 pairs of socks. How much will his total profit be?
[Answer]Niko will earn $2 x 25 / 100 = $0.5 profit for each of the first four pairs of socks. So, his total profit for the four pairs of socks will be $0.5 x 4 = $2. His total earnings for the 5 pairs of socks is $0.2 x 5 = $1. Therefore, his total profit will be $2 + $1 = $3. The answer is 3.
Q: Brian can only hold his breath underwater for 10 seconds. He wants to get better, so he starts practicing. After a week, he's doubled the amount of time he can do it. After another week, he's doubled it again from the previous week. The final week, he's increased it by 50% from the previous week. How long can Brian hold his breath for now?
A: At the end of his first week, Brian now has doubled his initial time of 10 seconds to 10 * 2 = 20 seconds. At the end of his second week, Brian doubled the previous week's time of 20 seconds to 20 * 2 = 40 seconds. At the end of his third week of practice, Brian adds another 50% of 40 seconds to his time so 40 * .5 = 20 seconds added. Having added 20 seconds to his time from his second week, Brian can now hold his breath for 40 + 20 = 60 seconds. The answer is 60.
