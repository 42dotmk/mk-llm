Q: Mrs. Anderson bought 2 bags of 3-pound bag of cat food and another 2 bags of dog food that each weigh 2 more pounds than each bag of cat food. There are 16 ounces in each pound. How many ounces of pet food did Mrs. Anderson buy?
A: The two bags of cat food weigh 2 x 3 = 6 pounds. Each bag of dog food weighs 3 + 2 = 5 pounds. So two bags of dog food weigh 2 x 5 = 10 pounds. Thus, Mrs. Anderson bought 6 + 10 = 16 pounds of pet food. And 16 pounds is equal to 16 x 16 = 256 ounces. The answer is 256.
Question: A building has four floors with ten rooms each. Legacy has to clean each room, and it takes her 6 hours to clean one room. If she earns $15 per hour of work, calculate the total amount of money she makes from cleaning all the floors in the building.
Answer: Since the building has four floors with ten rooms each, the total number of rooms in the building is 4 * 10 = 40. If it takes Legacy 6 hours to clean each room, she will take 40 * 6 = 240 hours to clean all the rooms in the building. Since she is making $15 per hour of work, she will earn $15 * 240 = $3600 after cleaning all the rooms. The answer is 3600.
[Question]It is recommended that men should consume no more than 150 calories of added sugar per day. Mark took a soft drink in the afternoon that contained 2500 calories, 5% of which was from added sugar. Then he bought some bars of candy which had 25 calories of added sugar each. If he eventually exceeded the recommended intake of added sugar by 100%, how many bars of candy did he take?
[Answer]He consumed 2500 calories, 5% of which is added sugar to give 2500 * (5 / 100) = 125 calories of added sugar. He exceeded the recommended intake of 150 calories by 100% for a total consumption of 150 + (150(100 / 100)) = $300. This means he took in 300 - 125 = 175 calories from candy alone. Each candy had 25 calories so 175 calories which means he consumed 175 / 25 = 7 bars?. The answer is 7.
Q: Nina makes one-of-a-kind jewelry and sells it at a local boutique. She charges $25.00 for her necklaces, $15.00 for bracelets and $10.00 for a pair of earrings.

She sold 20 earrings for $10.00 a pair for a total of 20 * 10 = $200.00. She sold 2 ensembles for $45.00 each for a total of 2 * 45 = $90.00. All total she made 125 + 150 + 200 + 90 = $565.00. The answer is 565.
Question: Barbara asked the butcher for 4 1/2 pound steaks that cost $15.00/pound. She also asked for a pound and half of chicken breasts that were $8.00 a pound. How much did she spend at the butchers?
Answer: She ordered 4 1 / 2 pound steaks so that's 4 * .5 = 2 pounds of steak. The steak cost $15.00 a pound and she bought 2 pounds so that's 15 * 2 = $30.00 for 4 steaks. She also needed 1.5 pounds of chicken breasts at $8.00 a pound so that's 1.5 * 8 = $12.00 for chicken. The steaks cost $30.00 and the chicken cost $12.00 for a total of 30 + 12 = $42.00 spent at the butchers. The answer is 42.
