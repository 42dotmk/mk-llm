Q: Donna is trying to figure out if her truck is over a particular bridge's weight limit. The bridge can hold 20,000 pounds. Donna's empty truck weighs 12,000 pounds. She's carrying 20 crates of soda that each weigh 50 pounds, 3 dryers that each weigh 3000 pounds, and twice as much weight in fresh produce as in soda. How much does Donna's fully loaded truck weigh?
A: First find the total weight of the soda by multiplying the number of crates by the weight per crate: 20 crates * 50 pounds / crate = 1000 pounds. Then find the weight of the fresh produce by doubling the weight of the soda: 1000 pounds * 2 = 2000 pounds. Now find the weight of the dryers by multiplying the quantity by the weight per item: 3 dryers * 3000 pounds / dryer = 9000 pounds. Now add the empty truck's weight to the weight of all three groups of products to find the fully loaded weight: 12000 pounds + 1000 pounds + 2000 pounds + 9000 pounds = 24000 pounds. The answer is 24000.

[Question]Harrison Elementary School is overcrowded with 1590 students, so 40% of the students are going to move to a new school. There are 3 grade levels, and each grade level needs one 20-person advanced class and the rest of the students divided evenly into 6 additional classes. How many students will there be in each normal class at the new school?
[Answer]First find how many students go to the new school: 1590 students * .4 = 636 students. Then divide that number by 3 to find how many students are at each grade level: 636 students / 3 grades = 212 students / grade. Then subtract the 20 students in the gifted class: 212 students - 20 students = 192 students. Then divide that number by 6 to find the number of students in each other class: 192 students / 6 classes = 32 students / class. The answer is 32.
Q: Kim plants 80 cherry pits. 25% of them sprout and Kim sells 6 of the saplings. How many cherry saplings does she have left?
A: First find the number of saplings that sprout: 80 pits * 25% = 20 saplings. Then subtract the number she sold to find the number she has left: 20 saplings - 6 saplings = 14 saplings. The answer is 14.
Question: Harold makes $2500.00 a month from his job. His rent is $700.00, his car payment is $300.00, his utilities cost 1/2 the amount of his car payment and he spends $50.00 on groceries. He wants to put half of the remaining money into a retirement account. How much money will that leave him?
Answer: His utilities cost 1 / 2 the amount of his $250.00 car payment so his utilities cost 250 / 2 = $125.00. All total, his bills cost him 775 + 250 + 125 + 50 = $1,200. He makes $2500 a month and his bills cost $1200 a month so that leaves him with 2500 - 1200 = $1300.00. He wants to put half of $1300 into a retirement account so he will invest 1300 / 2 = $650 into his retirement account. He had 1300 and puts $650 into his retirement account so that leaves him with 1300 - 650 = $650 remaining. The answer is 650.
