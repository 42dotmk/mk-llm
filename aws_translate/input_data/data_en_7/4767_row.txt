Question: I went to the music shop and there were CDs of The Life Journey for $100, A Day a Life for $50, and When You Rescind for $85 on display. If I bought 3 of each CD to share with my friends, what's the total amount of money I spent in the shop?
Answer: The total cost of The Life Journey is 3 × $100 = $300. The total cost of When You Rescind is 3 × $85 = $255. The total cost of A Day a Life is 3 × $50 = $150. The total cost for all the CDs is $150 + $255 + $300 = $705. The answer is 705.
[Question]Jacob has been tasked with a project to write up an urban plan proposal that will be used to construct a new city. He uses Pittsburg city as a reference which has 2000 stores, 500 hospitals, 200 schools, and 20 police stations. If the new city should have half the number of stores, twice as many hospitals, 50 fewer schools, and 5 more police stations, what is the total number of buildings required for this project?
[Answer]The number of stores required for the new city is 2000 / 2 = 1000 stores. The number of hospitals required for the new city is 2 * 500 = 1000 hospitals. The number of schools required for the new city is 200 - 50 = 150 schools. The number of police stations required for the new city is 20 + 5 = 25 police stations. The total number of buildings required for this new city project 1000 + 1000 + 150 + 25 = 2175 buildings. The answer is 2175.
Q: Mary, Jess, and Christina want to decorate a party room with balloons. Each person inflates balloons at different speeds, and they only have 30 minutes to inflate as many balloons as possible. Mary inflates 10 balloons per minute, Jess inflates 7 balloons per minute and Christina came 15 minutes late and was the slowest one inflating 4 balloons per minute. How many balloons can they inflate before running out of time?
A: Mary will inflate a total of 10 balloons / minute x 30 minutes = 300 balloons. Jess will inflate a total of 7 balloons / minute x 30 minutes = 210 balloons. Christina will inflate a total of 4 balloons / minute x 15 minutes = 60 balloons. Combining all balloons, they made 300 balloons + 210 balloons + 60 balloons = 570 balloons. The answer is 570.
Question: Tyson can swim at a speed of 3 miles per hour in a lake and 2.5 mph in an ocean. This season, half his races happened in lakes and half his races happened in the ocean. He had ten total races, each of which was 3 miles long. How much time did he spend in his races?
Answer: He did 5 races in the lake because 10 / 2 = 5. He did 5 races in the ocean because 10 / 2 = 5. He raced 15 miles in the lake because 5 x 3 = 15. His lake races took 6 hours because 15 / 2.5 = 6. He raced 15 miles in the ocean because 5 x 3 = 15. His ocean races took 5 hours because 15 / 3 = 5. He spent 11 hours racing because 5 + 6 = 11. The answer is 11.
[Question]Mcdonald is planning to open up a farm that provides eggs to the community. In his local community, Saly needs 10 eggs, Ben needs 14 eggs, and Ked needs half of the number of eggs needed by Ben per week. In a month which has 4 weeks, how many eggs should Mcdonald's farm produce?
[Answer]Ked needs 14 / 2 = 7 eggs. Mcdonald has to produce 10 + 14 + 7 = 31 eggs in a week. Therefore, Mcdonald's farm has to produce 31 x 4 = 124 eggs in a month. The answer is 124.
