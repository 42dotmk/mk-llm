Q: A highway is being extended from its current length of 200 miles up to 650 miles. 50 miles are built on the first day, and three times this amount are built on the second day. How many miles still need to be added to the highway to finish extending it?
A: The length of the highway that needs to be constructed is 650 – 200 = 450 miles. After the first day, there are still 450 – 50 = 400 miles that need to be constructed. On the second day, 50 miles * 3 = 150 miles are added to the highway. This means that 400 – 150 = 250 miles still need to be added to the highway. The answer is 250.
Question: Juan bought T-shirts for his employees. He bought shirts for men and women. Women's t-shirts are $5 cheaper than men's t-shirts of the same color. His company has 2 sectors, one in white t-shirts and the other in black t-shirts. He paid $20 for white men's t-shirts and $18 for black men's t-shirts. The 2 sectors have the same number of men and women, with a total of 40 employees. How much did he spend total on buying t-shirts?
Answer: For each type of shirt, he needed to buy, 40 employees / 4 = 10 shirts. White men's T - shirts cost $20 / shirt * 10 shirts = $200. White women's T - shirts cost $5 less, or ($20 / shirt - $5 / shirt) * 10 shirts = $15 / shirt * 10 shirts = $150. Black men's t - shirts cost, $18 / shirt * 10 shirts = $180. Black women's T - shirts cost $ 5 less, so ($18 / shirt - $5 / shirt) * 10 shirts = $13 / shirt * 10 shirts = $130. Now add up all these quantities to find the total: $200 + $150 + $180 + $130 = $660. The answer is 660.
[Question]Every year, Tabitha adds a new color to her hair. She started this tradition when she was 15 years old, which was the year she added her second hair color. In three years, Tabitha will have 8 different colors in the hair. Currently, how old is Tabitha?
[Answer]Since, three years from now, Tabitha will have 8 different colors in her hair, this year she has 8 - 3 = 5 colors in her hair. Since she had 2 colors in her hair at the age of 15, she has added 5 - 2 = 3 colors since she was 15 years old. Since she ads one color per year, 3 added colors = 3 added years. Thus, currently, she is 15 + 3 = 18 years old. The answer is 18.
