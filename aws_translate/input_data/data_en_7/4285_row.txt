The 'Reign of Terror', also known as 'The Terror,' was a particularly violent political period that took place in France during the years 1793-94. It was amidst the turbulence of the French Revolution, which lasted from 1789 to 1799. The Reign of Terror was characterized by a series of chaotic, bloody, and ruthless measures taken against perceived enemies of the French Republic, leading to mass executions and rampant persecution.

The French Revolution began in 1789 due to widespread social and political discontent in France. The nation was facing economic hardships, and the governance under King Louis XVI was marked by injustice and inequality. The revolution aimed to establish a more egalitarian society by dismantling the existing feudal system and monarchical power. The radical revolutionary movement, marked by the fall of the Bastille prison in July 1789, sought to change the ancien r√©gime radically and implement new political, social, and economic reforms.

Despite early successes, such as the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and the establishment of a constitutional monarchy, the revolution became increasingly unstable. As new radical factions emerged, internal and external conflicts intensified. France found itself at war with several European countries, including Austria, Prussia, and Great Britain, which saw the revolution as a potentially contagious threat to their own monarchical systems. Simultaneously, counter-revolutionary groups within France sought to preserve or restore the pre-revolutionary status quo.

The Reign of Terror unfolded in this context of mounting chaos and paranoia. At its helm were the radical Jacobins, led by Maximilien Robespierre, Georges Danton, and Jean-Paul Marat, who came to power by overthrowing the moderate Girondin faction within France's National Convention. The Jacobins instituted the Committee of Public Safety, which acted as a de-facto government, implementing harsh measures to ensure the revolution's progress.

During the Reign of Terror, thousands of perceived enemies of the revolution were arrested, tortured, and executed, many by guillotine. Victims included royalists, moderates, rival revolutionary factions, and, eventually, even original Jacobin leaders such as Danton and Desmoulins. At the height of this brutal period, between June and July of 1794, an event called the Great Terror saw nearly 1,400 executions in Paris alone.

The Reign of Terror finally ended on July 27, 1794, with the fall of Robespierre, who was arrested, condemned to death, and guillotined. His execution marked a significant shift in the French Revolution, leading to the decline of radicalism and the beginning of the more conservative phase known as the Thermidorean Reaction. Ultimately, the French Revolution would lead to the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte and the establishment of the Napoleonic era, which further transformed France and Europe at large.

In summary, the Reign of Terror took place in France between 1793 and 1794 during the French Revolution. A radical period marked by extreme violence, political persecutions, and mass executions, it was led by the Jacobin faction under the influence of Robespierre, Danton, and Marat. Although it eventually came to an end with Robespierre's fall, the Reign of Terror's ruthless legacy remains a critical part of French revolutionary history.
