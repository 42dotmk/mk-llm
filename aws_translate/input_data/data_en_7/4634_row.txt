Question: Debra is the host of a country music radio show, and she broadcasts interviews with celebrity country music singers. Each week, she interviews three singers, one at a time. The first interview segment is always twice as long as the other two segments combined, and the third interview segment is always half as long as the second. If the third segment is 10 minutes long, how many minutes long is the entire show?
Answer: If the third segment is half as long as the second, then the second segment is twice as long as the third, or 10 * 2 = 20 minutes long. The first segment is twice as long as the other two combined, or 2 * (10 + 20) = 60 minutes. Thus, in total, the show is 10 + 20 + 60 = 90 minutes long. The answer is 90.
[Question]The distance across a country is 8205 kilometers. Amelia started at one end and drove 907 kilometers on Monday and 582 kilometers on Tuesday. How many kilometers does Amelia still have to drive to make it across the country?
[Answer]Distance driven = 907 + 582 = 1489 km. Distance remaining = 8205 - 1489 = 6716 km. Amelia still has 6716 kilometers to drive. The answer is 6716.
Q: Martha is making centerpieces for her Thanksgiving dinner. There are six centerpieces, and each centerpiece uses 8 roses, twice as many orchids as roses, and a certain number of lilies. If Martha wants to spend $2700 total, and each flower costs $15, how many lilies will she put in each centerpiece?
A: First figure out how many total flowers Martha is going to buy by dividing her total spending by the price per flower: $2700 / $15 / flower = 180 flowers. Now figure out how many flowers are in each centerpiece by dividing the total number of flowers by the number of centerpieces: 180 flowers / 6 centerpieces = 30 flowers / centerpiece. Now figure out how many orchids are in each centerpiece by multiplying the number of roses per centerpiece by 2: 8 roses / centerpiece * 2 = 16 orchids / centerpiece. Now subtract the number of roses and orchids per centerpiece from the total number of flowers per centerpiece to find the number of lilies per centerpiece: 30 flowers - 16 orchids - 8 roses = 6 lilies. The answer is 6.
Question: A bathroom has 10 6 inch tiles along its width and 20 6 inch tiles along its length. What is the square footage of the bathroom?
Answer: There are 10 tiles that are 6 inches long running the width of the bathroom so it is 10 * 6 = 60 inches long. There are 12 inches in a foot and it’s 60 inches wide so it is 60 / 12 = 5 feet wide. There are 20 tiles that are 6 inches long running the length of the bathroom so it’s 20 * 6 = 120 inches long. There are 12 inches in a foot and it’s 120 inches long so it is 120 / 12 = 10 feet wide. The square footage is l x w so the bathroom has 10 * 5 = 50 sq feet. The answer is 50.
[Question]Louie obtained 80% on a math quiz. He had 5 mistakes. How many items were there on the math quiz?
[Answer]Louie got 100% - 80% = 20% of the total items incorrect, which is equal to 5 items. So 1% is equal to 5 / 20 = 1 / 4 of an item. Hence, the total number of items, represented by 100%, on the math quiz was 1 / 4 of an item x 100 = 25. The answer is 25.
