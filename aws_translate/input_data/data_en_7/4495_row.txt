In order to write a creative marketing brief, follow these steps:

1. Assemble a diverse team: Gather a team of advisors and experts within your company from different departments, such as marketing, sales, design, and content. This interdisciplinary approach ensures that you include various perspectives in the brief and increases the chances of delivering a successful marketing campaign.

2. Define the objective: Clearly state the marketing goals and objectives for your project, considering factors like target audience, intended outcome, brand positioning, and the competitive landscape.

3. Provide context: Explain the background and reasoning behind your project, including the company's current market position, any recent changes in the industry, and potential opportunities or threats.

4. Identify the target audience: Describe your target audience in detail, listing their demographics, psychographics, and any specific behavior or needs that your campaign should address.

5. Outline the key message: Develop a clear and compelling key message for your marketing campaign, keeping in mind your target audience and overarching goals. This message should embody the central theme of your campaign and guide subsequent creative output.

6. Establish the tone and style: Specify the overall tone and style you'd like your campaign to have, whether it's humorous, serious, or inspirational. Provide some visual or written examples to give your team a clear idea of what you're aiming for.

7. Detail the deliverables: List all the marketing materials and content formats you plan to create, such as social media posts, blog articles, videos, print materials, and more. Be as precise as possible, including word counts, dimensions, and any production requirements.

8. Set a timeline and budget: Establish a realistic timeline for the completion of each deliverable and the overall project. Allocate a budget for each task and the overall project, keeping in mind any potential contingencies or unforeseen circumstances.

9. Assign responsibilities: Clearly define roles and responsibilities within your team, assigning tasks to specific individuals or departments. This will help to ensure that everyone understands their role in the project and that tasks are completed on time and within budget.

10. Include a feedback and evaluation process: Outline the process for reviewing, revising, and evaluating the marketing materials to ensure they meet the stated objectives and align with your brand identity. This could include regular team meetings, internal or external reviews, and post-project analysis.

In conclusion, having at least two experts on your team is certainly a good starting point when writing a creative marketing brief, but the actual number of experts is subject to the size and requirements of your marketing project. Engaging experts from various departments also enhances the depth and accuracy of the marketing brief, improving the overall success of your campaign.
