Bernie Madoff, the former non-executive chairman of the NASDAQ stock market and founder of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, was selling a fraudulent investment scheme known as a "Ponzi scheme." This answer provides a summarized version of the information surrounding the revelation of Bernie Madoff's fraudulent activities: "On December 10, 2008, Madoff's sons told authorities that their father had confessed to them that the asset management unit of his firm was a massive Ponzi scheme, and quoted him as describing it as "one big lie.""

To provide a more detailed and long answer, we must explore the background, mechanics, and impacts of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme.

Bernie Madoff began his investment business, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, in 1960. The firm started as a penny stock trader and later became a prominent market maker, involved in both proprietary trading and asset management. The asset management unit of the company was where Madoff operated his notorious Ponzi scheme.

A Ponzi scheme is a type of investment scam where earlier investors are paid returns out of the capital received from new investors, instead of profits earned by the business itself. The constant need for fresh funds to maintain payouts and the illusion of profitability leads these schemes to eventually collapse when there are not enough new investors or when many investors attempt to cash out.

In Madoff's case, he lured investors with promises of high and consistent returns, typically around 10-12% annually. He targeted wealthy individuals, charities, and institutional investors. The illusion of a successful investment operation was maintained by generating fabricated account statements that displayed steady profits, even during periods of market downturns.

The scheme operated for decades, eventually managing billions of dollars. However, it started to unravel as a result of the 2008 financial crisis, when many investors began requesting redemptions. As the market conditions worsened, Madoff struggled to attract new investors to fund these payouts.

In December 2008, Bernie Madoff confessed to his sons that the asset management unit was, in fact, a Ponzi scheme. His sons reported the confession to federal authorities on December 10, 2008. Bernie Madoff was arrested the following day and charged with securities fraud.

The aftermath of Madoff's arrest was immense. Thousands of investors lost a significant amount of money, with the estimated losses around $65 billion at the scheme's peak. Numerous individuals and organizations experienced financial ruin as a result of their investments with Madoff.

In June 2009, Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies, including securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering. He was subsequently sentenced to 150 years in prison. The case led to additional regulatory reforms and renewed focus on investor protection by the government and financial industry watchdogs.

In conclusion, Bernie Madoff was selling a massive Ponzi scheme through the asset management unit of his firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC. His fraudulent actions led to billions lost for his investors and the eventual collapse of the scheme due to the financial crisis in 2008. Following his confession and his sons' report, Madoff was arrested and eventually sentenced to 150 years in prison for the numerous financial crimes he committed.
