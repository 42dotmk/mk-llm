The question for Parliament is: Can this Parliament do something at the European level to reverse this development?

In response to this question, let me provide a detailed answer on what can be done by the Parliament on the European level to reverse the development in question:

To address the concern, the European Parliament can take several actions, each of which requires collaboration among member states, at the institutional, regulatory, and financial levels. Here is an overview of possible steps that can contribute to reversing the ongoing development:

1. Legislative Initiatives: The European Parliament can promote new legislative proposals or recommend amendments to existing laws overseeing this particular development. By reshaping the legal framework, Parliament may create favorable conditions for steering the change in the desired direction.

2. Policies and Strategies: Parliament can work towards the development of a comprehensive policy or strategy encompassing the entire European Union. This may include setting common goals, designing guidelines, and developing action plans to facilitate a coordinated approach among member states.

3. Financial Support: The European Parliament can propose the allocation of funds to support projects and initiatives related to the problem at hand. This can be accomplished through grants, subsidies, or other forms of financial assistance, which can incentivize stakeholders to take actions that align with the desired outcome.

4. Encourage Cross-border Collaboration: Facilitating cooperation among member states is crucial, and the Parliament may take a proactive role in promoting partnerships and joint programs. Establishing frameworks for collaboration, sharing best practices, and providing logistical support can create optimal conditions for creating solutions that resonate with all countries involved.

5. Awareness and Education Campaigns: The European Parliament can endorse awareness-raising campaigns, educational programs, and capacity-building initiatives to inform citizens, stakeholders, and other relevant actors of the issue and engage them in solving it. Through increased awareness and understanding, more people will be motivated to participate in reversal efforts.

6. Advocacy and Diplomacy: By actively engaging with European institutions, international organizations, and third countries, the Parliament can advocate for the matter in question, thus promoting the issue on the international stage. Diplomatic efforts may contribute to creating a favorable environment for change and, in some cases, even facilitate the signing of international agreements or treaties.

7. Monitoring and Evaluation: The European Parliament can establish mechanisms to assess the progress made in reversing the development and identify any obstacles. By collecting, analyzing, and disseminating data, member states can receive feedback on whether their actions are effectively contributing to the desired outcome and make adjustments as necessary.

Each of these measures may be pursued individually or combined in a multifaceted strategy to address the development in question. By working together and leveraging the power of the European Union as a unified force, the European Parliament can help drive change on the continental level, contributing to a reversal of an undesired development that affects multiple member states.
