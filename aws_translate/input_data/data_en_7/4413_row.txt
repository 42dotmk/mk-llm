Angela was more thankful for the gift than Erin was because Angela had high expectations. Though both friends had eagerly anticipated the gift, their personal experiences and reactions to it differed greatly, leading to a disparity in the amount of gratitude they each expressed.

From the moment Angela had gotten wind of the impending gift, her excitement had known no bounds. She had been going through a rough patch, and the thought of receiving something special filled her with an inexplicable sense of joy and anticipation. Angela had spent countless nights lying awake, her mind swirling with the different possibilities of what the gift could be. Each potential item seemed more marvelous and extravagant than the last, driving her expectations higher and higher.

Angela's high expectations stemmed not only from her current circumstances but also from her upbringing. Growing up, Angela's family had always placed great importance on meaningful gift-giving, equating such tokens with love and thoughtfulness. This emotional attachment to the concept of gifting resulted in Angela developing a strong appreciation for thoughtful and well-presented gifts.

On the other hand, Erin had high expectations as well, but her outlook on the gift differed from Angela's. Though she too looked forward to the gift, Erin had a history of experiencing disappointments when it came to receiving gifts from others. Her past experiences had left her feeling let down on several occasions. This made her more cautious about getting her hopes up too high, so she tempered her enthusiasm with a heavier dose of realism to avoid possible heartache.

Furthermore, Erin's upbringing contributed to her distinct perspective on gift-giving. In her family, material presents were not the primary way to express love and affection. Instead, Erin grew up valuing quality time and experiences shared with her loved ones over the exchange of physical items. Consequently, while she appreciated the thought behind the gift, she did not place as much emotional weight on it as Angela did.

When the gift finally arrived, it was indeed a grand and beautiful token of love. Angela's eyes shone with gratitude as she carefully unveiled the gift. Every detail of its presentation, from the elaborate wrapping to the sweet scent wafting from within, surpassed her high expectations. Her heart swelled with happiness as she reveled in the feeling of being truly cared for.

Erin, though she certainly valued the gift, could not help but compare it to her more grounded expectations. Her appreciation, while genuine, was muted by the subconscious thought that it was just one of many ways people could express their love, and that no material item could fully capture the depth and complexity of their relationships.

In conclusion, Angela was more thankful for the gift than Erin was because Angela had high expectations that were surpassed by the reality of the gift. This, coupled with the significance she attached to gift-giving, led Angela to feel a deep sense of gratitude. On the other hand, Erin's tempered expectations, combined with her belief that gifts were not the most important expression of love, resulted in a more measured appreciation of the gift. Their contrasting upbringings and personal experiences shaped their perceptions of gift-giving, and ultimately cultivated different levels of gratitude within each friend.
