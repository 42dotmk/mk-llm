Samantha looked deep into Megan's eyes, her heart racing. She could feel the nerves knotting in her stomach as she considered the enormity of the question. The two women had been together for several years, their love for each other growing stronger every day. Marriage had always been a dream for both of them, although they had never really discussed it in detail. Now, with the weight of the question hanging in the air and the reality of one of them being pregnant, Samantha realized there was no turning back.

(i) Megan's pregnancy had come as a surprise to both of them. They had been talking about starting a family, but had not yet decided on the particulars. Now, with a baby on the way, everything seemed to have a new sense of urgency. As Megan's dark brown eyes stared into Samantha's blue ones, Samantha couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and fear. 

She took a deep breath and replied, "Megan, I love you more than anything in this world. But before we rush into anything, I think we need to consider everything carefully. A baby is a blessing, but it also brings many challenges. Maybe instead of rushing into marriage, we should spend some time preparing for our baby and growing together as a family." 

Megan nodded in understanding. She knew Samantha was right. While marriage was a dream they both shared, it wasn't something that could be rushed into without considering the impact it would have on their developing family. Hand in hand, they stepped into this new journey together, building a life filled with love and happiness.

(ii) Samantha's pregnancy had been a pleasant shock for both of them. At the beginning of their relationship, they had discussed starting a family and having a child. They had reevaluated their priorities, visited a local fertility clinic, and decided to proceed with Samantha as the one carrying the child.

Now, faced with Megan's sudden proposal, Samantha bravely swallowed her emotions and replied, "Megan, you know how much I love you and how much I have always wanted to marry you. However, I don't want us to rush into marriage just because I am pregnant. Getting married should be a decision we make because we want to spend the rest of our lives together, not simply due to circumstances."

Megan sighed in relief, glad that Samantha shared her concerns. They decided to focus on preparing for their baby's arrival and continued to plan a wedding at a pace that felt comfortable for both of them. They spent hours discussing baby names, colors for the nursery, and the values they wanted to impart to their child. At the same time, they made preparations for their upcoming wedding - visiting venues, selecting a guest list, and assembling their dream wedding.

As their baby grew inside Samantha, so did their love for each other. Megan held Samantha's hand throughout the entire pregnancy and childbirth, supporting her every step of the way. Finally, the day came when they welcomed their beautiful baby into the world.

After their child's birth, the couple's love grew even stronger. Marriage followed a few months later, with their precious baby taking part in the ceremony. Their intimate wedding, surrounded by family and friends, not only symbolized their commitment to each other but also to their newly formed family. Together, hand in hand, they embarked on a new journey filled with love, joy, and hope for the future.
