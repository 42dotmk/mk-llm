Question: Bess and Holly are playing Frisbee at the park. Bess can throw the Frisbee as far as 20 meters and she does this 4 times. Holly can only throw the Frisbee as far as 8 meters and she does this 5 times. Each time Bess throws a Frisbee, she throws it back to her original position. Holly leaves her Frisbee where it lands every time she throws it. In total, how many meters have the thrown Frisbees traveled?
Answer: Bess throws the Frisbee out 4 times * 20 meters each time = 80 meters. She then throws it back which doubles the distance traveled to 80 meters * 2 = 160 meters. Holly throws the Frisbee out 5 times * 8 meters = 40 meters. So in total, Holly and Bess have thrown the Frisbees 160 + 40 = 200 meters. The answer is 200.
[Question]A play was held in an auditorium and its ticket costs $10. An auditorium has 20 rows and each row has 10 seats. If only 3/4 of the seats were sold, how much was earned from the play?
[Answer]There are 20 x 10 = 200 seats in the auditorium. Only 200 x 3 / 4 = 150 seats were sold. Hence, the earnings from the play is $10 x 150 = $1500. The answer is 1500.
Q: Billy has four horses. Each one eats 4 pounds of oats, twice a day. How many pounds of oats does he need to feed his horses for 3 days?
A: At each feeding Billy serves 4 horses x 4 pounds of oats / horse = 16 pounds / feeding. Each day Billy uses 16 pounds of oats / feeding x 2 feedings / day = 32 pounds of oats / day. Triple that amount to find the amount of oats needed to feed the four horses for three days: 32 pounds of oats / day x 3 days = 96 pounds. The answer is 96.
Question: Raj's house has an area equal to 1,110 square feet. It has 4 bedrooms that each measure 11 x 11 feet. There are 2 bathrooms that are 6 x 8 feet each. The kitchen and living area complete the home and they have the same sized area. How many square feet is the area of the kitchen?
Answer: Area of 1 bedroom = 11 * 11 = 121 square feet. Area of 4 bedrooms = 121 * 4 = 484 square feet. Area of 1 bathroom = 6 * 8 = 48 square feet. Area of 2 bathrooms = 2 * 48 = 96 square feet. Area of all bedrooms and bathrooms = 484 + 96 = 580 square feet. Kitchen + living room = 1,110 - 580 = 530. Kitchen = 530 / 2 = 265. The kitchen is 265 square feet. The answer is 265.
[Question]Linda is building a new hotel with two wings. The first wing has 9 floors and each floor has 6 halls each with 32 rooms. The second wing has 7 floors each with 9 halls with 40 rooms each. How many rooms are in the hotel total?
[Answer]First find the number of rooms per floor in the first wing: 32 rooms / hall * 6 halls / floor = 192 rooms / floor. Then find the total number of rooms in the first wing by multiplying that number by the number of floors: 192 rooms / floor * 9 floors = 1728 rooms. Then find the number of rooms per floor in the second wing: 40 rooms / hall * 9 halls / floor = 360 rooms / floor. Then find the total number of rooms in the second wing by multiplying that number by the number of floors: 360 rooms / floor * 7 floors = 2520 rooms. Then add the total number of rooms in each wing to find the overall total: 1728 rooms + 2520 rooms = 4248 rooms. The answer is 4248.
