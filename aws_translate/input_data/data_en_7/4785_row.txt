Question: Susie babysits every day for 3 hours a day at the rate of $10 per hour. She spent 3/10 of the money she earned from last week to buy a make-up set. She then spent 2/5 of her money on her skincare products. How much is left from her earnings last week, in dollars?
Answer: Susie earned $10 x 3 = $30 per day. Last week, she earned a total of $30 x 7 = $210. She spent $210 x 3 / 10 = $63 on make - up. While she spent $210 x 2 / 5 = $84 on her skincare products. Thus, she spent a total of $63 + $84 = $147 from her earnings. Therefore, Susie is left with $210 - $147 = $63 from her earnings last week. The answer is 63.
[Question]Bob ordered 80 packs of Greek yogurt from Costco to use for the month. However, when the delivery arrived, he realized 40% of the packs were expired. He decided to return those packs. If each pack was $12, how much was Bob refunded for the expired product?
[Answer]The number of Greek yogurt packs that had expired is 40 / 100 * 80 = 32. If each pack of Greek yogurt was sold at $12, for the 32 packs of greek yogurt that he returned, Bob was refunded $12 * 32 = $384. The answer is 384.
Q: Billy is counting the rings in two trees. Weather fluctuations in this area mean that each tree's rings are in groups of two fat rings and four thin rings. If Billy counts 70 ring groups in the first tree and 40 ring groups in the second tree, how much older is the first tree? (Trees grow 1 ring per year.)
A: First find the total number of rings in a ring group: 2 rings + 4 rings = 6 rings. Then subtract the number of ring groups in the second tree from the number in the first tree to find the difference: 70 groups - 40 groups = 30 groups. Then multiply that number by the number of rings in a group to find the difference in the trees' ages: 30 groups * 6 rings / group = 180 rings, or 180 years. The answer is 180.
Question: Luna, the poodle, is supposed to eat 2 cups of kibble every day. But Luna's master, Mary, and her husband, Frank, sometimes feed Luna too much kibble. One day, starting with a new, 12-cup bag of kibble, Mary gave Luna 1 cup of kibble in the morning and 1 cup of kibble in the evening, But on the same day, Frank also gave Luna 1 cup of kibble in the afternoon and twice as much in the late evening as he had given Luna in the afternoon. The next morning, how many cups of kibble will Mary find remaining in the bag?
Answer: Mary fed Luna 1 + 1 = 2 cups of kibble. Frank fed Luna 1 - cup plus twice 1 - cup, or 1 + 2 = 3 cups of kibble. In total, they fed Luna 2 + 3 = 5 cups of kibble. Thus, if the new bag held 12 cups of kibble, the next morning, 12 - 5 = 7 cups of kibble remained in the bag. The answer is 7.
[Question]Five times a week, Onur bikes 250 kilometers a day. His friend Hanil bikes 40 more kilometers of Onur biking distance in a day. What's the total distance the two friends bikes in a week?
[Answer]Since Onur bikes 250 kilometers in a day, he bikes 5 * 250 = 1250 kilometers for five days in a week. Onur's friend Hanil bikes 40 more kilometers in a day than Onur, meaning he bikes for 250 + 40 = 290 kilometers. In five days of the week, Hanil covers 290 * 5 = 1450 kilometers. In total, the two bikes for 1450 + 1250 = 2700 kilometers in 5 days of a week. The answer is 2700.
