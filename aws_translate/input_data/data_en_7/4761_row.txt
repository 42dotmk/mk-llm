2). Elena had previously traveled to Japan.

Elena smiled warmly as she remembered her own travels to Japan and was more than happy to share her experiences and advice with Felicia. "First and foremost," she began, "it's important to remember that Japanese culture and etiquette can be quite different from what we're used to in the west. Respecting these customs and traditions will go a long way in helping you fit in."

"One of the most important customs to remember," Elena continued, "is the practice of bowing. It's essential in Japan and signals respect and appreciation. There are different levels of bows, but as a foreigner, a simple 15-degree bow when greeting someone will be acceptable."

Felicia nodded, making a mental note to practice her bowing before her trip. Elena then shared another crucial aspect of Japanese etiquette: the exchange of business cards. "If you're going on a business trip, it's important to know how to properly exchange business cards, or 'meishi'. Offer and accept cards with both hands, and make sure to examine the card in front of the person who gave it to you to show your appreciation."

Elena then delved into the subject of manners in public spaces. "In Japan, it's considered impolite to talk loudly or speak on the phone while on public transportation. You'll find the trains to be quite quiet, so be sure to follow suit and keep your voice down," she advised.

Felicia's eyes widened as she realized there were so many nuances to consider. Elena reassured her that there was no need to worry about being perfect. "As a foreigner, you'll be given some leeway," she said, "but being aware of these cultural differences is already a big step in the right direction."

She went on, discussing customs related to visiting temples and shrines, such as cleansing oneself with water before entering and making a small donation before offering a prayer. Elena also stressed the importance of dressing modestly when visiting sacred sites, as a sign of respect.

Another topic that came up was the art of gift-giving. Elena smiled as she shared her experiences of "omiyage," or souvenir gifts, that are often exchanged as a way of maintaining social relationships. "If you're visiting someone's home or meeting someone for the first time, it's considered polite to bring a small gift, ideally something that represents your home country."

Moving on to dining etiquette, Elena shared the importance of saying "itadakimasu" before a meal and "gochisosama" after finishing it. "These phrases are a way to express gratitude for the food," she explained. "And remember to never point your chopsticks at someone, and don't stick them vertically into a bowl of rice, as that's considered disrespectful."

"As for getting around," Elena shared some practical advice. "Navigating the streets of Japan can be a challenge, as most streets don't have names and addresses can be confusing. Using a GPS or maps application on your smartphone can be a lifesaver. However, don't hesitate to ask for directions, as the Japanese people are often eager to help, even with a language barrier."

Felicia listened intently, taking in all of Elena's insights and experiences from her travels in Japan. She left their conversation feeling more prepared and confident, knowing that she would be respectful of the local customs and traditions while enjoying her own journey through the beautiful and enchanting country of Japan.
