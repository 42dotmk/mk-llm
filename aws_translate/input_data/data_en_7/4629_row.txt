Joseph had a deep-seated love for animals, particularly bunny rabbits. This had grown from his early years, when he was first introduced to these delightful creatures by his grandmother during his visits to her countryside home. Joseph's connection with rabbits was not merely for their fluffiness or charming dispositions but went deeper, primarily towards their unique personalities and behaviors that he found fascinating and heartwarming.

In contrast, Kyle was less of an animal enthusiast and more of a practical character. He kept a few rabbits, largely due to societal pressure and as a means to teach his children about responsibility. His involvement with them was not as immersive, nor as romantic, as Joseph's. Kyle's rabbits were well-taken care of, but the quantity and variety were much less than that of Joseph's. The reason was simple - Kyle saw these pets more as a duty or obligation rather than companions to cherish.

Joseph’s affinity for rabbits manifested itself in several ways that led to his larger collection. Initially, Joseph began by adopting rabbits from local shelters, rescuing them from poor living conditions. He devoted a significant portion of his backyard to create a bunny haven, a space designed specifically to suit their needs. Thanks to his meticulous research, the space was safe and comfortably equipped with necessary amenities such as a variety of foods rabbits eat, several mini hutches for shelter and resting, and open areas for them to play and exercise.

With time, Joseph's involvement in the local rabbit communities escalated. He began attending rabbit shows, participating in online groups, and fostering close friendships with fellow rabbit enthusiasts who shared his passion. It was not long before Joseph became a well-known figure to local breeders and sometimes was given the privilege to adopt special breeds.

Joseph’s dedication extended beyond simply housing the rabbits. He invested time in studying rabbit care, even undertaking a basic veterinary course to understand their health better. He prepared their meals with a precision that represented his understanding of their dietary needs, ensuring each meal was a healthy blend of hay, fruits, vegetables, and rabbit pellets. 

Joseph also took the time to interact with each rabbit individually to keep them mentally stimulated. His rabbits were given names that represented their unique personalities, and he spent countless hours observing them interact, memorizing their individual behaviors, traits, preferences, and even their dislikes. They were not merely pets to him; they were his little companions, each with a unique personality and a special place in his heart.

To sum up, Joseph had many more bunny rabbits than Kyle because his love extended beyond just owning pets. His respect, dedication, and understanding of these animals were profound, evident from his commitment to their care and well being. From rescue missions to providing a safe haven, engaging with rabbit communities to adopting special breeds, Joseph's actions were fuelled by his deep love for bunnies. Unlike Kyle, for whom rabbits were more of a responsibility, Joseph saw them as a meaningful part of his life, each rabbit adding a new dimension to his vernacular of joy and companionship. Their numbers kept on adding, not because he wanted to boast of more, but because his heart had made space for yet another fluffy friend.
