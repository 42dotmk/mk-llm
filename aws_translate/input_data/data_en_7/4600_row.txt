Yes, that is correct. The British navy defeated the Eight Banners forces at Ningbo and Dinghai during the First Opium War. To provide more context, here is a detailed explanation of the event and its historical significance:

The First Opium War took place between 1839 and 1842 and was fought between the British Empire and the Qing Dynasty of China, primarily over their disagreements regarding the trade of opium. The war marked a turning point in China's dealings with foreign powers and set the stage for a series of unequal treaties that would have far-reaching consequences for China.

The Eight Banners forces were an integral part of the Qing Dynasty's military organization. The Eight Banners system was established during the early years of the dynasty and comprised soldiers from various ethnic groups, including the Manchu, Han, Mongols, and others. These forces were divided into eight separate banners, each represented by different colors and insignia. The primary purpose of the Eight Banners forces was to serve as the backbone of the Qing military. Doing so, they played a crucial role in maintaining social order and protecting the empire from external threats.

In 1841, the British navy, under the command of Admiral Sir William Parker, launched an offensive campaign against the Chinese coastal cities of Ningbo and Dinghai. These cities were strategically important, as they controlled the access routes to the larger cities of Hangzhou and Shanghai. By capturing Ningbo and Dinghai, the British navy aimed to exert further pressure on the Qing government and force them to negotiate on their terms.

The British navy's superior firepower and advanced military tactics soon proved to be too much for the Eight Banners forces stationed at Ningbo and Dinghai. Despite a fierce resistance and the use of advanced weaponry, such as the deployment of the "Red Barbarian" cannon and the strategic positioning of fire ships, the Qing military was ill-prepared for the British navy's onslaught. Commanders on the British side included senior officers such as Captain Richard Saunders Dundas and naval strategist Sir Henry Pottinger, who played key roles in outmaneuvering their opponents.

The British navy successfully defeated the Eight Banners forces at Ningbo on March 10, 1841, and later at Dinghai on July 2, 1841. The Qing forces not only suffered significant casualties in these battles, but following the capture of these cities, the British forces ravaged the surrounding towns and villages, further exacerbating the devastation faced by the local population. The Ningbo and Dinghai victories significantly weakened China's ability to resist further British incursions.

The British victory over the Eight Banners forces at Ningbo and Dinghai ultimately paved the way for the end of the First Opium War. As a result of their losses and the crippling decline in their military capabilities, the Qing government was eventually forced to sign the Treaty of Nanking in August 1842. This treaty, considered the first of the unequal treaties, marked the beginning of a series of humiliating and exploitative treaties imposed by Western powers upon China during the 19th century.

In conclusion, during the First Opium War, the British navy defeated the Eight Banners forces at Ningbo and Dinghai, leading to the eventual signing of the Treaty of Nanking and the beginning of China's "Century of Humiliation."
