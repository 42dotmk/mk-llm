[Question]Apollo pulls the sun across the sky every night. Once a month, his fiery chariotâ€™s wheels need to be replaced. He trades golden apples to Hephaestus the blacksmith to get Hephaestus to make him new wheels. Hephaestus raised his rates halfway through the year and now demands twice as many golden apples as before. He charged three golden apples for the first six months. How many golden apples does Apollo have to pay for the entire year of chariot wheels?
[Answer]Apollo had to pay 3 * 6 = 18 golden apples for the first six months. For the second six months, he had to pay twice that amount, or 18 * 2 = 36 golden apples. Thus, Apollo had to pay 18 + 36 = 54 golden apples for a year of chariot wheels. The answer is 54.
Q: In today's field day challenge, the 4th graders were competing against the 5th graders. Each grade had 2 different classes. The first 4th grade class had 12 girls and 13 boys. The second 4th grade class had 15 girls and 11 boys. The first 5th grade class had 9 girls and 13 boys while the second 5th grade class had 10 girls and 11 boys. In total, how many more boys were competing than girls?
A: When you add up all the girls from all 4 classes, you had 12 + 15 + 9 + 10 = 46 girls. When you add up all the boys from all 4 classes, you had 13 + 11 + 13 + 11 = 48 boys. There are 48 boys and 36 girls so 48 - 46 = 2 more boys. The answer is 2.
Question: Bob bought 2 show dogs for $250.00 each to breed as a side business. The female just had a litter of 6 puppies. If he sells each puppy for $350.00, what is his total profit?
Answer: He bought 2 dogs for $250.00 each so they costs 2 * 250 = $500.00. He sells each of the 6 puppies for $350.00 so he'll make 6 * 350 = $2,100.00. He made $2,100 on the puppies but spent $500.00 to buy the dogs so his total profit is 2,100 - 500 = $1,600.00. The answer is 1600.
[Question]Eric sorted 150 colored pencils into 5 containers for his art class. Before class, another teacher brought him 30 more pencils. How many can he evenly distribute between the five containers now?
[Answer]Before the extra colored pencils, he had 150 / 5 = 30 colored pencils in each container. With the other colored pencils, he is given he now has 150 + 30 = 180 colored pencils. If you distribute them evenly each container should have 180 / 5 = 36 colored pencils. The answer is 36.
Q: Sophie does 4 loads of laundry a week and uses 1 dryer sheet per load. A box of dryer sheets costs $5.50 and has 104 dryer sheets in a box. On her birthday, she was given wool dryer balls to use instead of dryer sheets. How much money does she save in a year not buying dryer sheets?
A: She does 4 loads of laundry a week and used 1 dryer sheet per load for a total of 4 * 1 = 4 dryer sheets in a week. She used 4 dryer sheets per week for 52 weeks for a total of 4 * 52 = 208 dryer sheets. Her box of dryer sheets has 104 sheets so she needs 208 / 104 = 2 boxes of dryer sheets. Each box costs $5.50 and she used 2 boxes so she now saves 5.50 * 2 = $11.00 by not buying dryer sheets. The answer is 11.
