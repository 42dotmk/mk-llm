Title: Virginia Order on Felon Voting Restoration Unconstitutional

Step 1: Introduce the topic
In this article, we will discuss the controversial order from the Virginia governor aimed at restoring the voting rights of felons, and why this order is being viewed as unconstitutional by critics. Providing a holistic view, we will dissect the arguments made by those who oppose the order and explore the implications for Virginia's criminal justice system and the state's political landscape.

Step 2: Summarize the order
In 2016, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe issued an executive order that restored voting rights to over 200,000 convicted felons who had completed their sentences, including those on probation or parole. The basis for this order was to remove the lifelong voting ban on these individuals and to foster their reintegration into society.

Step 3: Present the arguments against the order
Critics argue that the Virginia order on felon voting restoration is unconstitutional for several reasons. They claim that:

1. The governor overstepped his authority: Opponents assert that Gov. McAuliffe exceeded the powers granted to him by the Virginia Constitution, which only allows for restoration of voting rights on an individual basis. By restoring the rights of an entire class of individuals en masse, the governor is said to have circumvented the intended checks and balances within the state government.

2. Violation of the separation of powers: Rivals claim that the order infringes on the legislative branch's authority to determine voting qualifications. By unilaterally restoring voting rights to large groups of felons, the governor effectively altered the qualifications for voting without proper legislative action.

3. Politically motivated decision: Detractors highlight that a significant number of affected individuals belong to demographic groups that traditionally lean Democratic. They suspect that the move might have been an attempt to manipulate voter demographics in favor of the Democratic Party.

Step 4: Discuss the implications of the order
If the Virginia order on felon voting restoration were deemed unconstitutional, it would have several implications:

1. Voting rights rollback: Thousands of felons who had their rights restored would once again be disenfranchised, further hindering their reintegration into society and potentially affecting their ability to contribute positively as citizens.

2. Legal battles: A decision against the order could prompt legal challenges and appeals, creating a prolonged legal tug-of-war that may drain resources and divert public attention from other pressing issues.

3. Impact on the political landscape: An invalidation of the order could stir political tensions and perhaps lead to polarization, as it could be perceived as stripping voting rights from citizens â€“ a fundamental aspect of democracy.

Step 5: Concluding thoughts
The Virginia order on felon voting restoration has sparked a heated debate over its constitutionality and the scope of a governor's power. Regardless of the outcome, it remains crucial to strike a balance between the competing goals of protecting the democratic process and ensuring that all citizens have the opportunity to participate in it. Ultimately, the weight of the decision lies with the judicial system, and its resolution will certainly have lasting effects on both the felons and the state's political climate.
