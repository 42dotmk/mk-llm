Q: A baseball team has averaged 15 hits per game over their first 5 games. There are 11 players on the team. Their best player has 25 total hits. If the other players continue their average over the next 6 games, how many hits will each player average across the 6 games in total?
A: The best player averages 5 hits a game because 25 / 5 = 5. The rest of the team averages 10 hits a game because 15 - 5 = 10. The rest of the players average 1 hit a game because 10 / 10 = 1. They will average 6 hits per player over the next 6 games because 6 x 1 = 6. The answer is 6.
Question: Mary wants to ride the world's tallest roller coaster, Kingda Ka. The minimum height to ride the roller coaster is 140 cm. Mary's brother is 180 cm, Mary is 2/3 the height of her brother. How many more centimeters does Mary need to grow to ride Kingda Ka?
Answer: Being 2 / 3 of her brother's height, Mary is 180 * 2 / 3 = 120 cm. To reach the minimum height and ride Kingda Ka, Mery needs to grow 140 - 120 = 20 cm. The answer is 20.
[Question]Lola plays basketball on her school team. Her team scored twice at many points at their last home game than their first away game. At the second away game, they scored eighteen points more than the previous away game. At the third away game, they scored two more points than at their second. If Lola’s team scored 62 points at their last home game, how many points do they have to score in their next game to bring their cumulative points up to four times the score from their last home game?
[Answer]At their following away game, Lola’s team scored half as many points as at their home game, so they scored 62 / 2 = 31 points. At the second away game, they scored 31 + 18 = 49 points. At the third away game, they scored 49 + 2 = 51 points. A cumulative score of four times their last home game is 4 * 62 = 248 points. Thus, Lola’s team has to score 248 - 193 = 55 points to bring their cumulative points up to 248. The answer is 55.
Q: John is holding a poker night with his friends and is getting the decks of cards ready before his friends show up. After losing so many cards from various decks, John thinks he needs to count exactly how many cards he has to make sure he has enough full decks for the night. Each deck of cards should hold 52 cards. He finds 3 half-full decks of cards and 3 full decks of cards. As he is arranging them, he realizes that the quality of a lot of the cards is quite poor and decides to throw 34 of the cards in the trash. How many cards does John now have?
A: In the full decks, John has a total of 52 cards in a full deck of cards * 3 full decks of cards = 156 cards. A half - full deck of cards contains 52 cards in a full deck of cards / 2 = 26 cards. So from the half - full decks, John has a total of 26 cards * 3 half - full decks = 78 cards. This is a total of 156 cards from full decks + 78 cards from half - full decks = 234 cards. After throwing some in the trash, he now holds a total of 234 cards - 34 trashed cards = 200 cards. The answer is 200.
