Question: Karen works at an animal shelter with 30 dogs, 28 cats, and 20 lizards. Every month, 50% of the dogs are adopted, 25% of the cats are adopted, and 20% of lizards are adopted. If the shelter takes in 13 new pets a month, how many pets are there after one month?
Answer: First find how many dogs get adopted each month by multiplying the number of dogs by their chance of getting adopted: 30 dogs * 50% = 15 dogs. Then do the same thing for the cats: 28 cats * 25% = 7 cats. And do the same thing for the lizards: 20 lizards * 20% = 4 lizards. Now add up the number of each kind of pet to find the initial total number of pets: 30 dogs + 28 cats + 20 lizards = 78 pets. Now subtract all the pets that get adopted in one month from the initial number of pets: 78 pets - 15 dogs - 7 cats - 4 lizards = 52 pets. Now add the extra 13 pets the shelter takes in that month to find the final number of pets: 52 pets + 13 pets = 65 pets. The answer is 65.
[Question]Jerry is cutting up wood for his wood-burning stove. Each pine tree makes 80 logs, each maple tree makes 60 logs, and each walnut tree makes 100 logs. If Jerry cuts up 8 pine trees, 3 maple trees, and 4 walnut trees, how many logs does he get?
[Answer]First find the total number of pine logs by multiplying the number of trees by the number of logs per tree: 80 logs / pine * 8 pines = 640 logs. Then do the same thing for the maple trees: 60 logs / maple * 3 maples = 180 logs. And do the same thing for the walnut trees: 100 logs / walnut * 4 walnuts = 400 logs. Finally, add up the number of logs from each type of tree to find the total number: 640 logs + 180 logs + 400 logs = 1220 logs. The answer is 1220.

Question: Due to a drought, Jerry's household can only use 1000 gallons of water during July. Jerry uses 100 gallons for drinking and cooking and 20 gallons per shower. He wants to fill his pool, which measures 10 feet by 10 feet by 6 feet. If each gallon of water fills 1 cubic foot of the pool, how many showers can Jerry take in July?
Answer: First find the total volume of the pool: 10 feet * 10 feet * 6 feet = 600 cubic feet. This is also the number of gallons he needs to fill the pool. Subtract the pool water and the drinking and cooking water from the total amount of water Jerry is allowed to use: 1000 gallons - 600 gallons - 100 gallons = 300 gallons. Then divide the amount of water Jerry has left to use for showers by the amount of water per shower to find how many showers he can take: 300 gallons / 20 gallons / shower = 15 showers. The answer is 15.
