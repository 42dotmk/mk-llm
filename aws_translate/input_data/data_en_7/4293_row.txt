[Question]Trevor and Joe were working together to finish a 500 piece puzzle. They put the border together first and that was 75 pieces. Trevor was able to place 105 pieces of the puzzle. Joe was able to place three times the number of puzzle pieces as Trevor. How many puzzle pieces are missing?
[Answer]The puzzle is 500 pieces and the border used 75 pieces so 500 - 75 = 425 pieces left. Joe placed three times as many puzzle pieces as Trevor who placed 105 so Joe placed 3 * 105 = 315 piece. Together Joe and Trevor placed 315 + 105 pieces for a total of 420 pieces. With the border down that left 425 pieces left and they put down 420 pieces so that meant 425 - 420 = 5 pieces were missing. The answer is 5.
Q: Justin wanted to watch a movie that came on at 8 pm that night. His parents agreed as long as he finished his homework and chores before the movie started. He wouldn't be home until 5 pm because of baseball practice. He knew dinner would take 45 minutes, and he figured his homework would take 30 minutes to finish. He needed to clean his room, which would take 30 minutes; then take out the trash, which would take about 5 minutes; and empty the dishwasher, which would take another 10 minutes. What was the latest time that Justin could start his chores and homework to be done by 8 pm to watch his movie?
A: Justin would spend 45 minutes at dinner, 30 minutes doing homework, 30 minutes cleaning his room, 5 minutes on the trash and 10 on dishes for a total of 45 + 30 + 30 + 5 + 10 = 120. Justin knows that 60min is the same as 1 hour. He has 120 minutes of work so 120 / 60 = 2 hours. His movie comes on at 8 pm and he has 2 hours of chores so 8 - 2 = 6 pm is the latest time he could start his chores. The answer is 6.
Question: Caleb is baking a birthday cake for his grandfather. His grandfather is turning 79 years old. Caleb puts three colors of candles on the cake. He puts one candle for each year for his grandfather. He puts 27 yellow candles, 14 red candles and the rest are blue candles. How many blue candles did he use?
Answer: Caleb has put 27 + 14 = 41 yellow and red candles. So, he used 79 - 41 = 38 blue candles. The answer is 38.
[Question]Janet buys a multi-flavor pack of cheese sticks. 15 of the sticks are cheddar, 30 are mozzarella, and 45 are pepperjack. If Janet picks a cheese stick at random, what is the percentage chance it will be pepperjack?
[Answer]First find the total number of cheesesticks: 15 cheddar + 30 mozzarella + 45 pepperjack = 90 cheese sticks. Then divide the number of pepperjack sticks by the total number of cheese sticks and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 45 pepperjack sticks / 90 cheese sticks * 100% = 50%. The answer is 50.
Q: If Layla scored 104 goals in four hockey games and Kristin scored 24 fewer goals in the same four games, calculate the average number of goals the two scored.
A: If Layla scored 104 goals in four hockey games and Kristin scored 24 fewer goals in the same four games, Kristin scored 104 - 24 = 80 goals. The combined number of goals they scored is 80 + 104 = 184. The average number of goals they scored is 184 / 2 = 92. The answer is 92.
