Title: Remembering Frank Kelly: A Fond Farewell to Father Jack Hackett

The Dublin skies were grey and somber, a fitting canvas for a city mourning the loss of one of its most iconic and beloved actors. Friends, family, and fans gathered to pay their last respects to the incomparable Frank Kelly as his funeral service took place on March 3. Known for his unforgettable portrayal of the lovably cantankerous priest Father Jack Hackett in the hit Channel 4 comedy 'Father Ted,' Frank Kelly's sudden passing left an indelible void in the hearts of those who knew him or admired his work.

Born in County Dublin on December 28, 1938, Frank Kelly's acting career spanned over six decades, with an impressive range of roles in theater, film, and television. Though his most famous role was undoubtedly as Father Jack, Kelly's talent for comedy shone through in his numerous other characters, including his work on 'Hall's Pictorial Weekly' and 'Glenroe,' and appearances in 'Emmerdale' and 'Mrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie.' A multifaceted artist, he was also known for his radio and television work as a writer, director, and producer.

At the service held in the Church of the Guardian Angels in Blackrock, the eulogies painted a vivid picture of a man who was as kind and generous as he was talented. His children recounted stories of their father with fondness, while fellow 'Father Ted' actor Joe Rooney, who played Father Damo, spoke lovingly of the show's impact and the lasting friendships forged during the three seasons it aired. A poignant moment occurred when Eoin McLove, a character from the show, recited one of Father Jack Hackett's iconic catchphrases: "Drink! Feck! Arse! Girls!" evoking laughter and tears from those in attendance.

Kelly's children described their father's love for his craft, and how acting was his passion from an early age. They recounted how their father studied acting at the Dublin's Gate Theatre, immersing himself in the works of Shakespeare and Beckett before branching out into a wide array of roles. He often claimed that playing Father Jack was "the gift of a lifetime," despite struggling at times with the immense public recognition that came with it.

The late actor's generosity was apparent in his philanthropic endeavors. Kelly was an active patron for many charitable organizations, including the Irish Heart Foundation and the Royal Hospital, Donnybrook. In remembrance of his kindness and dedication to the well-being of others, the mourners were encouraged to make donations to ASPISC (Association for Suicide Prevention and Inner City Services), a charity close to Kelly's heart.

As the funeral procession made its way through the streets of Dublin, the city that had been his home for so many years, it was clear that the impact of Frank Kelly's life and career went far beyond his time on the screen. His warmth, humor, and humanity touched the lives of everyone he met, and the legacy he leaves behind is one that will be cherished forever.

In the words of Father Ted's creator, Graham Linehan, "If I live to be a hundred, I won't come up with another character as funny as Father Jack." For those who loved and admired Frank Kelly, there can be no truer sentiment. As the curtains close on this extraordinary life, we say farewell to the man who created one of television's most iconic characters and, in doing so, brought laughter and joy to the hearts of countless viewers around the world.
