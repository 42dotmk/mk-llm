Logan had never fired a gun before, so Michael took him to a firing range, where he hoped to introduce his friend to the basics of firearm safety and proper shooting techniques in a controlled and secure environment. Michael, an experienced shooter and gun enthusiast, believed that it was important for everyone, even those who might not have a personal interest in guns, to gain a basic understanding of them. This stemmed from his belief that a lack of education and understanding could foster unnecessary fear or biased opinions. Furthermore, knowing how to handle a firearm safely could come in handy in unexpected situations.

Upon arriving at the state-of-the-art indoor range, the pair was greeted by a friendly on-site staff member who helped them check in and navigate the facility's rules and regulations. As part of their introduction to the world of shooting sports, they were required to attend a first-time shooter safety briefing where they were provided with essential protective gear like headsets to muffle the sound of gunshot blasts and eye protection to shield their eyes from any stray debris.

Once the briefing was completed and the proper gear was donned, Michael led Logan to the rental counter where they would select a firearm suited to a beginner. While Logan felt a mixture of excitement and uneasiness at the prospect of holding a gun, Michael reassured him by carefully selecting a smaller caliber pistol, recognized for its accuracy and minimal recoil. He explained that starting with a smaller caliber weapon would allow Logan to focus on accuracy and technique, whilst growing accustomed to the noise and sensation of firing a gun.

With their protective gear and rental firearm in hand, the pair proceeded to their assigned lane in the spacious firing range. Michael took the time to explain different parts of the gun, the correct way to load the magazine, and the proper stance for shooting before they begin. Emphasizing the importance of safety, Michael reminded Logan to always treat firearms as if they were loaded and never to point the muzzle at anything he didn't intend to shoot.

Stepping up to the firing line, Logan listened attentively as Michael guided him through the process of lining up the sights, slowly exhaling, and smoothly pulling the trigger. Though Logan's arms wobbled slightly with the weight of the pistol and his heart pounded in his chest, he felt a rush of adrenaline as he fired his first shot and watched the bullet pierce the paper target downrange.

Throughout their time at the range, Logan gained confidence under Michael's patient tutelage. They practiced various shooting drills, focusing on improving grip, stance, and trigger control. By the end of their session, Logan's initial nervousness had subsided, and he felt a newfound appreciation for the skill and responsibility required to handle a firearm safely and proficiently.

As they left the firing range, Logan thanked Michael for introducing him to this eye-opening experience which had changed his perspective on firearms and their role in modern society. While he might not become a gun enthusiast like Michael, he recognized the importance of firearm education and respected the dedication and skill it took to become a proficient shooter. The day at the firing range had not only been a bonding experience for the friends but also an educational moment that would stay with Logan for a lifetime.
