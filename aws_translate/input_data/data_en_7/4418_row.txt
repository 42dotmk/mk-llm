Question: Jamie is a firefighter. One day an emergency call comes in from Mrs. Thompson, an elderly woman whose cat can't get down a 20-foot tree.

The cypress trees will earn Gloria 20 trees * $100 / tree = $2000. From the sale of the cypress trees, Gloria will also make 600 trees * $200 / tree = $120000. Finally, the maple trees will bring in 24 trees * $300 / tree = $7200. Combining all the amounts will give Gloria a total of $150 + $2000 + $120000 + $7200 = $129350. Subtracting the cost of the mountain cabin from the total will leave Gloria with a balance of $129350 - $129000 = $350.
The answer: 350
Reverse engineering the question: Gloria wants to buy the $129,000 mountain cabin that her friend Alfonso is selling. She only has $150 in cash. She intends to raise the remaining amount by selling her mature trees for lumber. She has 20 cypress trees, 600 pine trees, and 24 maple trees. She will get $100 for each cypress tree, $300 for a maple tree, and $200 per pine tree. After paying Alfonso for the cabin, how much money will Gloria have left?

The answer: 17

Between 2:30 pm and 5:00 pm, there are 2.5 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2.5 hours x 60 = 150 minutes. Her family was in the bathroom 45 + 30 + 20 = 95 minutes. Mrs. Parker has 150 minutes – 95 minutes = 55 minutes in the bathroom.
The answer: 55

How much time will Mrs. Parker have to use the bathroom to leave on time?

Reasoning and answer: First find the total volume of the smoothie mix: 500 ml + 100 ml = 600 ml. Then divide the total volume by the volume per serving to find the number of servings: 600 ml / 150 ml / serving = 4 servings.

Reasoning and answer: After paying the deposit, Danielle still has to pay a total of $280k purchase price - $40k deposit = $240k via her mortgage. As the mortgage is over 10 years, Danielle’s payments need to total $240k mortgage balance / 10 years = $24k per year. So each month, Danielle has to pay $24k per year / 12 months in a year = $2k per month.
