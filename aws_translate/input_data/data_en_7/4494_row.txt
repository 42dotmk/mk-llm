Question: John has to pay taxes. He earned $100,000 for the year. He has $30,000 in deductions. The first $20,000 of taxable income is taxed at 10%. The rest is taxed at 20%. How much does he pay in taxes?
Answer: His taxable income is 100,000 - 30,000 = $70,000. So he pays 20,000 * .1 = $2000 tax at the lower rate. He has to pay 70,000 - 20,000 = $50,000 at the higher rate. The taxes for that is 50,000 * .2 = $10,000. So his total tax bill is 10,000 + 2,000 = $12,000. The answer is 12000.

[Answer]After spending money on a shirt, Lily had $55 - $7 = $48 left. She spent $7 x 3 = $21 on another store. Therefore, she only has $48 - $21 = $27 left on her account. The answer is 27.
Q: Joy fosters dogs. The mom foster dog eats 1.5 cups of food, three times a day. The puppies each eat 1/2 cup of food, twice a day. There are 5 puppies. How much food will Joy need for the next 6 days?
A: The mom dog eats 1.5 cups of food * 3 = 4.5 cups per day. For 6 days the mom dog will need 6 * 4.5 cups = 27 cups of food. The puppies eat 1 / 2 cup of food * 2 = 1 cup per day. There are 5 puppies * 1 cup = 5 cups per day for the puppies. For the 6 days, the puppies will need 5 cups * 6 = 30 cups of food. Combined the dogs will need 27 cups + 30 cups = 57 cups. The answer is 57.
Question: In the Oprah Winfrey High School marching band, each trumpet and clarinet player carries 5 pounds of weight, each trombone player carries 10 pounds of weight, each tuba player carries 20 pounds of weight, and each drum player carries 15 pounds of weight. If there are 6 trumpets, 9 clarinets, 8 trombones, 3 tubas, and 2 drummers, how much weight does the total marching band carry?
Answer: First find the total number of clarinet and trumpet players: 6 players + 9 players = 15 players. Then find the total weight of the trumpets and clarinets: 15 players * 5 pounds / player = 75 pounds. Then find the total weight of the trombones: 8 players * 10 pounds / player = 80 pounds. Then find the total weight of the tubas: 3 players * 20 pounds / player = 60 pounds. Then find the total weight of the drummers: 2 drummers * 15 pounds / player = 30 pounds. Then add the weight of each type of instrument to find the total weight: 75 pounds + 80 pounds + 60 pounds + 30 pounds = 245 pounds. The answer is 245.
[Question]Karen had the giant box of crayons, containing twice as many crayons as were in Beatrice's box. But Beatrice's box contained twice as many crayons as were in Gilbert's box of crayons. And Gilbert had four times as many crayons as were in Judah's box of crayons. If Karen's box contained 128 crayons, how many crayons were in Judah's box?
[Answer]If Karen's 128 crayons were twice as many as were in Beatrice's box, there were 128 / 2 = 64 crayons in Beatrice's box. And since Beatrice's box contained twice as many crayons as were in Gilbert's box of crayons, then Gilbert had 64 / 2 = 32 crayons. And since Gilbert had four times as many crayons as Judah, then Judah had 32 / 4 = 8 crayons. The answer is 8.
