The car manufacturer that made models called 'Chamois' and 'Gazelle' was the British company, Singer Motors Limited. Singer Motors was founded in 1905 and specialized in manufacturing a range of cars, as well as bicycles and motorcycles. The company was well-known for its premium vehicles and technological innovations, which often resulted in the production of high-quality and unique car designs. Let's delve deeper into the two mentioned models:

1. Singer Chamois:
The Singer Chamois was a small car produced from 1964 to 1970. It was essentially a luxury version of the popular Hillman Imp, a model produced by the Rootes Group, which acquired Singer Motors in 1956. The Chamois was designed to appeal to buyers searching for a more upscale vehicle within the Imp range. 

The Singer Chamois was powered by a rear-mounted 875cc aluminum engine that produced around 42 horsepower. It featured a rear-wheel drive layout, with a rear cooling system as well. The car's design offered a water-cooled inline-four engine placed longitudinally behind the rear axle, which was quite unique among other mini cars at the time. This design choice resulted in a larger and more spacious cabin, making it more comfortable for passengers.

In terms of visual differences, the Chamois had a distinct grille design, featuring a horizontal three-bar grille with a centrally-mounted Chamois emblem. It also offered better interior trim, including wood veneer dashboard, individual front seats, improved upholstery, and the signature 'Chamois' badge on the bonnet and rear.

Throughout its production run, the Singer Chamois saw multiple variants such as Chamois Sport and Chamois Coup√©, which differed mainly in their performance and styling features.

2. Singer Gazelle:
The Singer Gazelle was a larger car manufactured from 1956 to 1970. It was a luxurious version of the Hillman Minx, another model from the Rootes Group, and was marketed as an upmarket alternative within the same range.

The Gazelle underwent several revisions and iterations during its production years, with six distinct series being introduced. The first series of the Gazelle featured a four-cylinder side-valve engine of 1,390cc displacement, which produced 47 horsepower. In later series, the engine was upgraded to a more modern overhead-valve unit, and by the time the Gazelle reached its sixth generation, it had a 1,725cc engine that offered 65 horsepower.

In terms of its design and styling, the Gazelle typically featured unique grille designs, badging, improved interior trim, and wood veneer dashboard. The Gazelle also incorporated wooden door cappings, full-width wheel trims, and chrome bumpers, adding to its upmarket appeal.

The Singer Gazelle was available in various body styles, including a 4-door saloon, a 5-door estate, and a 2-door convertible. The convertible version was particularly popular due to its sleek design and premium feel.

In conclusion, Singer Motors Limited, the British car manufacturer, produced the Singer Chamois and Singer Gazelle models. These cars were positioned as luxurious versions of existing popular models from the Rootes Group, providing customers with more upscale features and refined styling. Singer Motors continued to operate until 1970, when the brand was eventually retired by the Rootes Group, which itself would later merge into the Chrysler UK and then finally become a part of the Peugeot group.
