1. 1634: The Bavarian Crisis
This historical event is the backdrop for a novel of the same name, written by Virginia DeMarce and Eric Flint. Published in 2007 as part of the 1632 book series, which Flint kicked off in 2000, the novel is an alternate history tale that presents a divergent course of European history. Set in the year 1634, this particular novel focuses on the various political and military challenges faced by the European countries during the Thirty Years War (1618-1648). The key plot driver is a crisis in Bavaria, which reaches its climax when an attempt to abduct the Swedish queen, Maria Eleonora, fails.
