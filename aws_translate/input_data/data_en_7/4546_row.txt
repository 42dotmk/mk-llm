If Chloe bought it for $50 per dozen, then half a dozen cost her $50 / 2 = $25. This means that she has $30 - $25 = $5 profit per half a dozen of chocolate - dipped strawberries. If Chloe sold 50 dozens, then she was able to sell 50 / 1 / 2 = 100 half a dozen chocolate - dipped strawberries. Hence, her profit is $5 x 100 = $500.
The answer: 500
Reverse engineering the question: Chloe bought chocolate-dipped strawberries at $50 a dozen. She then sold them for $30 for half a dozen during the Mother's Day celebration. How much is Chloe's profit if she sold 50 dozens?

Reasoning and answer: The weight of apples used for juice and given to the restaurant is 60 + 90 = 150 kg. Thus 405 – 150 = 255kg worth of apples were sold in 5 kg bags. There were 255 / 5 = 51 bags sold. So each bag was sold for 408 / 51 = $8.
The answer: 8

If Betty had 60 marbles, she gave Stuart 40 / 100 * 60 = 24 marbles. Since the number of marbles in Stuart's collection increased to 80 after Betty gave him 24 marbles, the number of marbles he initially had is 80 - 24 = 56.
The answer: 56
Reverse engineering the question: After Betty gave Stuart 40% of her marble collection, the number of marbles in Stuart's collection increased to 80. If Betty had 60 marbles, how many marbles did Stuart have initially?

Reasoning and answer: The solid wall is 8 ft. * 20 ft. = 160 sq. ft. The doorway is 3 ft. * 7 ft. = 21 sq. ft. The window is 6 ft. * 4 ft. = 24 sq. ft. The closet door is 5 ft. * 7 ft. = 35 sq. ft. The total area of the doors and windows is 21 sq. ft + 24 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. = 80 sq. ft. The solid wall is 160 sq. ft., so before the areas of the doors and window are taken into account, the total wall area is 4 * 160 sq. ft. = 640 sq. ft. Taking into account the doors and window, the total wall area Linda will have to paint is 640 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 560 sq. ft.
The answer: 560

Question: Linda is painting her bedroom. Her bedroom has 4 walls, with the room being 20 feet wide by 20 feet long by 8 feet tall. One wall has a 3-foot by 7-foot doorway. A second wall has a 6-foot by 4-foot window. A third wall has a 5-foot by 7-foot doorway to a walk-in-closet. And the fourth wall is completely solid. What is the total area of wall space that Linda will have to paint?

Reasoning and answer: If there are 3 identical cylindrical structures, with a combined total of 72 rooms, then each individual cylindrical structure contains 72 / 3 = 24 rooms. In each 24 - room cylindrical structure, there are 24 - 12 - 7 = 5 kitchens. Thus, the entire, three - cylinder space station contains a total of 3 * 5 = 15 kitchens.
The answer: 15
