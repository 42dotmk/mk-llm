Question: Julie works at a restaurant that pays her an hourly rate of $5. She works 8 hours a day and 6 days a week. How much is her monthly salary if she was not able to go to work for a day?
Answer: Julie's daily earnings are $5 x 8 = $40. Her weekly earnings are $40 x 6 = $240. Her monthly earnings are $240 x 4 = $960. Since she was not able to work for a day, her salary will be $960 - $40 = $920. The answer is 920.
[Question]Mrs. Brynlee reduced the prices of items in her store by 20% after the local government gave small businesses in her county a subsidy. If the price of a shirt in the store was $60 and that of the leather jacket was $90, calculate the amount of money Teagan will pay for buying 5 shirts and 10 leather jackets at the reduced prices.
[Answer]If the price of a shirt in the store was $60, its price was reduced by 20 / 100 * $60 = $12. The price of a shirt was reduced to $60 - $12 = $48. Teagan will pay $48 * 5 = $240 for buying 5 shirts. If the initial price of the leather jacket was $90, the price reduced by 20 / 100 * $90 = $18. The final leather jacket after Mrs. Brynlee reduced the price by 20% is $90 - $18 = $72. Teagan will pay $72 * 10 = $720 for buying 10 leather jackets. The amount of money Teagan paid to Mrs. Brynlee for the shirts and the leather jackets is $720 + $240 = $960. The answer is 960.
Q: Chris buys 2 and a half dozen donuts on his way to work to share with his co-workers. While driving, he eats 10% of the donuts. Once inside, he grabs another 4 donuts for his afternoon snack. How many donuts are left for his co-workers?
A: He buys 2 and a half dozen donuts so that's 2.5 * 12 = 30 donuts. He eats 10% of the donuts on his way to work so he eats .10 * 30 = 3 donuts. He bought 30 donuts and ate 3 so that leaves 30 - 3 = 27 donuts. Once inside, he grabs another 4 donuts of his afternoon snack so that leaves 27 - 4 = 23 donuts for his co - workers. The answer is 23.
Question: Dennis wants to buy 4 pairs of pants from the store which cost $110.00 each with a 30% discount and he also wants to buy 2 pairs of socks which cost $60.00 with a 30% discount. How much money will Dennis have to spend in total after he bought all the items he wants after the discount?
Answer: Dennis wants to buy 4 pairs of pants which cost 110x4 = $440. And he also wants to buy 2 pairs of socks that cost 60x2 = $120. The total amount he needs to spend without the discount is 440 + 120 = $560. The discount he will have amounts to $560x.0.30 = $168.00. So the total amount he needs to spend after deducting the discount from the total amount is 560 - 168 = $392. The answer is 392.
[Question]A movie theater can hold 50 people at a time. They charge $8.00 a ticket. On a Tuesday night they only sold 24 tickets. By not selling out, how much money did they lose?
[Answer]The theater can hold 50 people and they charge $8.00 to watch a movie so on a sold - out night they make 50 * 8 = $400.00. On Tuesday night they only sold 24 tickets at $8.00 apiece so they made 24 * 8 = $192.00. If they make $400.00 on a sold - out night and they only made $192.00 on Tuesday then they lost 400 - 192 = $208.00. The answer is 208.
