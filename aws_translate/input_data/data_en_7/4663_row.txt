(2). Derrick was more concerned with drinking.

Eric and Derrick were polar opposites when it came to their approach to life. Eric was the introspective, diligent student who lost himself in his studies, while Derrick was more of a social butterfly, focusing more on his social life and the many parties college had to offer. 

With both of them being roommates in college, it soon became apparent that Derrick was more concerned with drinking and other indulgences. Perhaps it was his rebellious nature or just the need for another adrenaline rush, Derrick could always be found holding a red solo cup in a crowded room of screaming, dancing students. 

Unlike Derrick, Eric had his priorities straight, which included putting his education first. He understood that college was an expensive investment in his future and was determined to get the most out of it. This attitude drove a wedge between the two friends, as Derrick could never understand why someone wouldn't want to participate in the revelry that occurred every weekend on campus. 

This contrast in behavior began to create a rift between the roommates. There were times that Derrick missed important lectures and assignments because he was recuperating from the previous night's excessive drinking - and Eric was forced to deal with the ensuing mess.

As the semester wore on, Eric's academic performance improved tremendously, so much so that he was on the verge of earning a prestigious scholarship. The professors recognized his hard work and dedication, which only served to motivate him to aim higher.

Meanwhile, Derrick started to realize the consequences of his incessant partying. His grades were slipping, and he found himself struggling to maintain the desired GPA. No matter how much he studied, he was unable to catch up with the academics he had neglected.

Worried for his friend, Eric tried to talk to Derrick about the future and the importance of focused efforts on academics. Yet, despite the seriousness of his intentions, Eric couldn't break through the barrier Derrick had erected around his beliefs.

Derrick, in a moment of realization, began to evaluate his actions. He suddenly understood that he was jeopardizing his future for fleeting pleasures. At first, this epiphany put a temporary halt to his drinking, but it wasn't long before he was back to his old ways.

After the semester ended, the differences between the two roommates continued to grow. Eric received numerous awards at the college's annual ceremony, including the prestigious scholarship that he had set his sights on. Derrick, on the other hand, found himself on the brink of dismissal due to his deplorable academic performance.

With summer unfolding, both roommates returned home. From that point on, their paths diverged significantly. Eric continued with his dedication to academics, earning a degree with honors, and later pursuing a successful career in his chosen field. Derrick, unfortunately, spiraled deeper into the world of alcohol and parties.

Their contrasting choices demonstrate the long-term effects of personal decisions. Eric's focus on his studies allowed him to establish a stable and thriving career, while Derrick's obsession with drinking resulted in a myriad of personal and financial issues. Through the lives of these roommates, the story serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of prioritizing academics and safeguarding one's future.
