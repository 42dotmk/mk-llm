Q: Jacque arrived in France and his suitcase weighed 5 pounds. While in France, he picked up 5 bottles of perfume that weighed 1.2 ounces each, 4 pounds of chocolate, 2 bars of soap that weighed 5 ounces each and 2 jars of jam that weighed 8 ounces each. Considering 16 ounces is the same as 1 pound, how much did Jacque's suitcase weigh on the return flight home?
A: He bought 5 bottles of perfume that weighed 1.2 oz each so they weighed 5 * 1.2 = 6 oz. 2 bars of soap weighed 5 oz each so they weighed 2 * 5 = 10 oz. 2 jars of jam weighed 8 oz each so they weighed 2 * 8 = 16 oz. The perfume is 6 oz, the soap is 10 oz and the jam is 16 oz for a total of 6 + 10 + 16 = 32 oz. 16 oz is 1 pound, and he had 32 oz in products so he had 32 / 16 = 2 pounds of products. His suitcase weighed 5 pounds, and the chocolate weighed 4 pounds and the remaining products weighed 2 pounds so his suitcase weighed 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 pounds. The answer is 11.
Question: Ten percent less than twice the total number of students present in the science class yesterday have attended class today. If there were 70 students in the class yesterday and 30 students are absent today, calculate the number of students registered for the course.
Answer: Twice the number of students present in the science class yesterday is 70 * 2 = 140. Ten percent less than twice the number of students present in the class yesterday means there are 10 / 100 * 140 = 14 fewer students than twice the number present yesterday. The number of students present in the science class today is 140 - 14 = 126. If the total number of registered students for the course who are absent today is 30, a full class of the science course has 126 + 30 = 156 students. The answer is 156.
[Question]Carla had 400 chickens on her chicken farm. However, 40% of the chicken died due to a certain disease. How many chickens were there if she bought ten times as many chickens as the number that died due to disease?
[Answer]If Carla had 400 chickens on her chicken farm, the number that died is 40 / 100 * 400 = 160. Carla remained with 400 - 160 = 240 chickens. Carla then bought 10 * 160 = 1600 new chickens. The total number of chicken that Carla had now is 1600 + 240 = 1840. The answer is 1840.
Q: Betty bought 1 kg of oranges and 3 kg of apples. The total cost of oranges was $12. The apples were two times cheaper than the oranges. How much did Betty pay for 1 kg of apples?

Question: Team Soccer Stars plays in a soccer league. They played a total of 20 games, and won 14 games, lost 2, and drew the rest of the matches. They earn 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and nothing for a loss. How many points did they have at the end of the season?
Answer: Soccer Stars won and lost a total of 14 + 2 = 16 games. This means they drew 20 - 16 = 4 games. The total points from the wins are 14 * 3 = 42 points. The total points from draws are 4 * 1 = 4 points. The total points from the losses are 2 * 0 = 0 points. They had 42 + 4 + 0 = 46 points when the season ended. The answer is 46.
