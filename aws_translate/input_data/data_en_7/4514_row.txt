[Question]Mark just got a new puppy that cost $10. He also bought enough food for 3 weeks. He knows the puppy eats 1/3 cup of food a day. A bag of food with 3.5 cups costs $2. How much did all of this cost him?
[Answer]He needs food for 21 days because 3 x 7 = 21. The puppy will eat 7 cups of food because 21 x (1 / 3) = 7. He needs 2 bags of food because 7 / 3.5 = 2. The food will cost him $4 because 2 x 2 = 4. It will cost $14 in total because 10 + 4 = 14. The answer is 14.
Q: Gwendolyn can read 200 sentences of a book in 1 hour. She just brought a book from the library, having 20 paragraphs per page. What's the total time Gwendolyn will take to read the book if each paragraph has 10 sentences and the book has 50 pages?
A: Gwendolyn just brought a book from the library, having 20 paragraphs per page, and since the book has 50 pages, the number of paragraphs in the book is 50 * 20 = 1000 paragraphs. If each paragraph has 10 sentences, the book's number of sentences is 1000 * 10 = 10000 sentences. Since Gwendolyn can read 200 sentences of a book in 1 hour, she will read 10000 sentences in 10000 / 200 = 50 hours. The answer is 50.
Question: Elmer has a pond that initially contained 2400 pollywogs, but these pollywogs matured into toads and left the pond at a constant rate of 50 pollywogs per day. In addition, Elmer has a son named Melvin, who loves to catch pollywogs, remove them from the pond, and release them into a nearby stream. For the first 20 days, Melvin caught 10 pollywogs per day and released them into the stream. How many days did it take for all of the pollywogs to disappear from the pond?
Answer: For the first 20 days, the combined rate of disappearance of pollywogs from the pond is 50 + 10 = 60 pollywogs per day. During these first 20 days, the total number of pollywogs removed was 60 * 20 = 1200 pollywogs. This means after 20 days there were 2400 - 1200 = 1200 pollywogs left in the pond. At a disappearance rate of rate 50 pollywogs per day, it will take an additional 1200 / 50 = 24 days for the rest of the pollywogs to disappear from the pond. Thus, overall, it will take 20 + 24 = 44 days for all of the pollywogs to disappear from the pond. The answer is 44.

Q: Mary went to the store to buy fruit. Apples cost $1, oranges cost $2, and bananas cost $3. For every 5 fruits that customers buy, the store offers a $1 discount. Mary buys 5 apples, 3 oranges, and 2 bananas. How much will she pay?
A: For 5 apples, Mary will pay 5 * 1 = 5 dollars. For 3 oranges, she will pay 3 * 2 = 6 dollars. For 2 bananas, she will pay 2 * 3 = 6 dollars. She bought 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 fruits. For 10 fruits, Mary gets a discount of 10 / 5 = 2 dollars. In total, the bill is 5 + 6 + 6 = 17 dollars. Subtracting the discount offered by the stores, Mary will pay 17 - 2 = 15 dollars. The answer is 15.
