Question: There are 50 apples and 40 oranges in the cafeteria. If an apple costs $0.80 and an orange costs $0.50, how much does the cafeteria earn for apples and oranges if there are only 10 apples and 6 oranges left?
Answer: Counting the remaining 10 apples. There were 50 - 10 = 40 apples sold. Counting the remaining 6 oranges. There were 40 - 6 = 34 oranges sold. The amount of sales for the apples is $0.8 x 40 = $32. The amount of sales for the oranges is $0.5 x 34 = $17. The cafeteria's total earnings are $32 + $17 = $49. The answer is 49.
[Question]This morning, farmer Rita's workers collected 30,000 gallons of milk and chilled it in a storage tank. They then spent the next 4 hours pumping milk at a rate of 2,880 gallons/hour from the storage tank into a milk tanker. For the next 7 hours, the workers added more milk into the storage tank, at a rate of 1,500 gallons per hour. How many gallons of milk were left in the storage tank?
[Answer]In the first 4 hours, the milk tanker got 4 hours * 2880 gallons / hour = 11,520 gallons. Thus, the storage tank was left with 30,000 gallons - 11,520 gallons = 18,480 gallons. For the next 7 hrs, the workers added 1,500 gallons / hour * 7 hours = 10,500 gallons. The total therefore is 18,480 gallons + 10,500 gallons = 28,980 gallons. The answer is 28980.

Question: Wendy works at a chocolate factory packing chocolates. She can package 2 dozen chocolates in 5 minutes. How many individual chocolates can she package in 4 hours?
Answer: There are 60 minutes in an hour and she packs chocolate in 5 - minute increments. So that's 60 / 5 = 12 5 minute increments in 1 hour. 12 chocolates make 1 dozen and she packages 2 dozen in 5 minutes so that's 12 * 2 = 24 chocolates in 5 minutes. 12 5 minute increments are in an hour and she packages 24 chocolates in 5 minutes so she can package 12 * 24 = 288 individual chocolates in 1 hour. If she packages 288 individual chocolates in 1 hour then in 4 hours she can package 288 * 4 = 1,152 individual chocolates. The answer is 1152.
[Question]Alan likes to support music creators, so instead of downloading songs from the internet, he visits a record store once in a while. He decided now to buy 2 CDs by "The Dark", 1 CD by the creator "AVN", and 5 CDs that are mixes of songs from the 90s. The price of the "AVN" CD is $12 and it is half the price of one CD by "The Dark". The 5 CDs of 90s music cost is 40% of all the cost of all other CDs Alan is going to buy. How much will Alan have to pay for all the products?
[Answer]If one "AVN" is half the price of one "The Dark" CD, that means one CD of "The Dark" costs 12 * 2 = $24. So for two "The Dark" CDs, Alan needs to pay 24 * 2 = $48. So all CDs cost by now 12 + 48 = $60. The 90s music CDs cost 40 / 100 * 60 = $24. That means for all CDs Alan needs to pay 60 + 24 = $84. The answer is 84.
