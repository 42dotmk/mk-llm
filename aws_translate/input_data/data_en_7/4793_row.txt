[Question]Carla adds a can of chilis, two cans of beans, and 50% more tomatoes than beans to a normal batch of chili. If she makes a quadruple batch, how many cans of food does she need?
[Answer]First find the number of cans of tomatoes in a normal batch of chili: 2 cans * 150% = 3 cans. Then add the number of cans of each type of food to find the total number of cans per batch: 3 cans + 2 cans + 1 can = 6 cans. Then multiply the number of cans per batch by the number of batches to find the total number of cans: 6 cans / batch * 4 batches = 24 cans. The answer is 24.
Q: Frank's laundry detergent is double concentrated and will wash 80 loads of laundry. His detergent is usually $25.00 a bottle but they're having a sale. If he buys 2 bottles, both bottles will drop to $20.00 a bottle. How much does he spend, in cents, per load of laundry, if he buys 2 bottles of detergent?
A: If he buys 2 bottles, the price drops to $20.00 per bottle so they cost 2 * 20 = $40.00. He can get 80 loads of laundry per bottle and he bought 2 bottles so that's 80 * 2 = 160 loads of laundry. The detergent cost $40.00 and he will be able to wash 160 loads of laundry so each load costs 40 / 160 = $0.25. The answer is 25.
Question: Bill gets paid $20 every hour he works up to a total of 40 hours, after which he gets paid double that amount per hour. How much does Bill get paid for a 50-hour workweek?
Answer: Bill makes $20 an hour for the first 40 hours, meaning he gets paid 40 * 20 = 800 dollars. For the remaining 10 hours, Bill gets paid double the amount of $20, meaning he makes 20 * 2 = 40 dollars an hour. Since he worked 10 hours at that $40 an hour rate, that means he gets paid 10 * 40 = 400 dollars for the final 10 hours. In total, this means Bill gets paid 800 + 400 = 1200 dollars for his workweek. The answer is 1200.
[Question]The base of a hill located beside a river is 300m above the seabed. If this depth is a quarter of the vertical distance between the riverbed and the peak of the hill, how high is the hill?
[Answer]300m is a quarter of the distance from the riverbed to the hill's peak so (1 / 4) * distance from riverbed to peak = 300m. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 4 gives the distance from riverbed to peak = 300m * 4 = 1200m. The height of the hill is the difference between the distance from the riverbed to the hill's peak and the distance from the riverbed to the hill's base which is 1200m - 300m = 900m. The answer is 900.
Q: Milly and Floretta are having a water balloon fight in their garden. They use 3 packs of their own water balloons and also use 2 packs of a neighbor’s water balloons. Each pack of water balloons contains 6 balloons. Milly and Floretta fill all of the balloons then split them evenly, but Milly takes an extra 7 balloons when Floretta isn't looking. How many water balloons is Floretta left with?
A: Milly and Floretta have a total of 3 packs of their own water balloons + 2 packs of the neighbor’s water balloons = 5 packs of water balloons. So there is a total of 5 packs of water balloons * 6 balloons per pack of water balloons = 30 water balloons available. As they split them evenly, they each have 30 water balloons / 2 = 15 water balloons. After Milly steals some balloons, Floretta is left with 15 – 7 = 8 water balloons. The answer is 8.
