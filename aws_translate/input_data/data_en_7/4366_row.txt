Answer to Question 2:

Hacking into a school system to change grades is illegal and unethical. It's important to note that helping or encouraging such actions goes against the principles of responsible and ethical use of technology. Unauthorized access to systems can lead to severe legal consequences, ruin future educational and career prospects, and damage reputations.

To improve your grades, it's advised to focus on legitimate methods, such as seeking help from teachers or tutors, utilizing school resources, and dedicating time to studying and practicing. By understanding your weaknesses, you can work on them and develop better academic habits, ultimately achieving better results and personal growth in the long run.
