[Question]James decides to make a bathtub full of jello. For every pound of water, you need 1.5 tablespoons of jello mix. The bathtub can hold 6 cubic feet of water. Each cubic foot of water is 7.5 gallons. A gallon of water weighs 8 pounds. A tablespoon of jello mix costs $0.50. How much did he spend to fill his tub?
[Answer]The tub has 6 * 7.5 = 45 gallons. That would weigh 45 * 8 = 360 pounds. So he needs 360 * 1.5 = 540 tablespoons of jello mix. So he spent 540 * .5 = $270. The answer is 270.
Q: Janet lives in a city built on a grid system. She walks 3 blocks north, then seven times as many blocks west. Then she turns around and walks 8 blocks south and twice as many blocks east in the direction of her home. If Janet can walk 2 blocks/minute, how long will it take her to get home?
A: First, find the total number of blocks south Janet is from her starting point by subtracting the blocks she walked north from the blocks she walked south: 8 blocks - 3 blocks = 5 blocks. Then find the number blocks she walked west: 3 blocks * 7 = 21 blocks. Then find the number of blocks she walked east: 8 blocks * 2 = 16 blocks. Subtract the number of blocks she walked east from the number of blocks she walked west to find how many blocks west of her starting point she is: 21 blocks - 16 blocks = 5 blocks. Add the number of blocks she needs to walk north to the number of blocks she needs to walk east: 5 blocks + 5 blocks = 10 blocks. Finally, divide the distance she needs to walk by her speed to find how long she'll spend walking: 10 blocks / 2 blocks / minute = 5 minutes. The answer is 5.
Question: Bryce is bringing in doughnuts for his class. There are 25 students in his class, 10 kids want chocolate doughnuts and 15 want glazed doughnuts. The chocolate doughnuts cost $2 each and the glazed doughnuts cost $1 each. How much is the total cost for doughnuts?

[Question]Vikki worked 42 hours in one week. Her hourly pay rate is $10. From her weekly earnings, 20% is deducted as tax, 5% is deducted as insurance cover, and $5 is deducted for union dues. How much money, in dollars, does Vikki take home after deductions?
[Answer]Vikki earnt 10 × $42 = $420 in one week. She then gets taxed $420 × 0.2 = $84. She also loses $420 × 0.05 = $21 due to insurance. Vikki also pays $5 in union dues. In total Vikki loses $84 + $21 + $5 = $110 because of deductions. Her final total pay after deductions is $420 - $110 = $310. The answer is 310.
Q: Alfred likes to save $1,000.00 over 12 months for his Christmas shopping. He has $100.00 left over from last year's holiday to put towards this year's goal. How much money does Alfred now need to save each month in order to reach his goal in 12 months?
A: He wants to save $1,000.00 and he has $100.00 left over so he still needs to save 1000 - 100 = $900.00. He wants to save $900.00 over 12 months so that means he needs to save 900 / 12 = $75.00 per month. The answer is 75.
