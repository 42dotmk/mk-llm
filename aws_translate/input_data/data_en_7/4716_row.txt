The film starts with a panoramic view of the quaint, peaceful town of Elmswood, with an ominous air that foreshadows the events to come. The main character, Sarah Collins, is a successful journalist in her late twenties, who returns to her hometown in search of a breaking story, only to find herself unraveling the haunting and twisted past of her favorite teacher from high school, Mr. Gribble.

While hanging out with her childhood friends at a local bar, they reminisce about their high school days and talk about where their lives have taken them. The topic of Mr. Gribble, their favorite teacher, and mentor shifts the conversation to a more serious tone. They recall how he had mysteriously vanished from the town years ago, leaving behind only vague rumors of his past.

Intrigued by Mr. Gribble's enigma and desperate for an exclusive story, Sarah decides to investigate. As she starts digging deeper through police records and newspaper archives, she discovers that the seemingly harmless teacher had been involved in a string of unsolved cases that have troubled the town for years.

The investigation takes a turn when Sarah and her friends stumble upon a hidden room in Mr. Gribble's old house, where they find an old journal alongside newspaper clippings of missing person cases - all of them former students who had mysteriously disappeared. The authorities, however, never considered Mr. Gribble a viable suspect due to his exemplary record and reputation in town.
