While the provided statement about the origins of canon law is accurate, it does not directly answer the question as it might be too brief and does not offer proper context. A more detailed and long answer to the question "In what type of religion are canon laws applicable?" could be:

Canon laws are applicable primarily in religions and religious traditions that have a structured hierarchy and an organized system of governance. One of the most well-known examples of a religion with canon law is the Roman Catholic Church, which has a complex system of governance that relies on canon law to regulate and maintain discipline among its clergy and lay faithful.

In the general context, canon laws are applicable in three main monotheistic religious traditions: Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. However, it should be noted that the way canon law is understood and applied within these religions varies significantly.

1. Christianity: Within the Christian tradition, especially in the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, canon law refers to the set of ecclesiastical laws, regulations, and legal principles created and enforced by the Church's hierarchical authorities for the governance of both the clergy and the laity. Canon law governs various aspects of church life, such as the administration of sacraments, the selection of church leaders, establishment and governance of religious institutions, and the conduct of clergy and faithful members. In Protestant denominations, although there might be a similar concept like "church order" or "church law," it does not follow the same structure and prominence as in the Catholic and Orthodox churches.

2. Judaism: In the Jewish tradition, canon law pertains more to the interpretation and application of religious law, otherwise known as Halakha. Halakha is derived from the written Torah, the oral Torah (Talmud), and rabbinic legal decisions. Similar to Christian canon law, Halakha covers various aspects of Jewish religious life, including dietary laws, prayer, Sabbath observance, and marital and family law. The interpretation and application of Halakha are overseen by Rabbis and scholars who have dedicated their lives to understanding and preserving Jewish religious law.

3. Islam: Islamic law, known as Sharia, functions as a kind of canon law in the Islamic tradition. Sharia is derived from the Quran, the Hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad), and the consensus of Muslim scholars (Ijma) and analogical reasoning (Qiyas). Sharia encompasses various facets of Islamic life, including religious rites, family law, business, and finance. Sharia is regarded as the divine law of Allah and is intended to guide and regulate the behavior of all Muslims. Sharia is interpreted and applied by religious scholars and jurists, and its implementation varies significantly between different Islamic societies and countries, depending on the prevailing legal system, customs, and cultural context.

In conclusion, canon laws are applicable in religious traditions that have an organized system of governance, legal principles, and the need for regulatory mechanisms to maintain order and discipline within the community. The concept and application of canon law vary across Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, but the basic premise of regulating religious life and providing guidelines for the behavior of the faithful remains consistent across these traditions.
