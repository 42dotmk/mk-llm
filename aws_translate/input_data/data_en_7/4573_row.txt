While the statement does provide some insight into the main principle driving Martin Luther and the later reformers, it is not a complete answer. To provide a more detailed and comprehensive answer, we should delve deeper into the historical context, the core beliefs of the Reformation, and the primary motivations of its key figures.

Martin Luther, a German theologian and monk, initiated the Protestant Reformation in the early 16th century. His primary objective was to challenge and reform the practices and doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church, which he believed had long deviated from the teachings of the Holy Scriptures. Luther's main principle can be better encapsulated in the concepts of "Sola Scriptura," "Sola Fide," "Sola Gratia," and "The Priesthood of all Believers."

1. Sola Scriptura (Scripture Alone): Luther asserted that the Bible alone should be the ultimate authority on Christian beliefs, practices, and faith. This principle stands in contrast to the Catholic tradition, where authority was derived not only from the Scriptures but also from Church hierarchy, tradition, and the Pope's authority. By emphasizing sola scriptura, Luther aimed to refocus Christian faith on its original source — the Word of God.

2. Sola Fide (Faith Alone): Luther was particularly troubled by the prevalent practice of indulgences in the Catholic Church, a system in which people could essentially buy their way into heaven by purchasing pardons for sins or by aiding the construction of churches. Luther believed that salvation was not obtained through good deeds, the purchase of indulgences, or participation in Church rituals. Instead, it was obtained solely through faith in Jesus Christ and his sacrificial atonement for humanity's sins. This principle of sola fide was fundamentally based on the teachings found in the New Testament.

3. Sola Gratia (Grace Alone): This principle emphasizes that God's grace, rather than human efforts or merits, is the ultimate source of salvation. Luther argued that although human beings are inherently sinful and undeserving, God, through his kindness and generosity, offers the free gift of salvation by grace alone. This belief was a direct challenge to the Catholic Church's stance on the role of good works, sacraments, and penance in achieving salvation.

4. The Priesthood of all Believers: Luther believed that each individual believer should have direct access to God without the need for ecclesiastical mediators, such as priests. This was a radical departure from the hierarchical structure of the Catholic Church, where the clergy was set apart as a privileged group with unique access to divine grace. By embracing the priesthood of all believers, Luther advocated for a personal relationship with God, with each believer actively engaging in the study of the Scriptures and serving as a minister to others.

In conclusion, Martin Luther's main principle transcends the single statement provided. It can more accurately be described as a combination of principles – Sola Scriptura, Sola Fide, Sola Gratia, and The Priesthood of all Believers – which aimed to challenge corruption, restore the authority of the Bible, and emphasize the importance of faith and grace in achieving salvation. These principles became the foundation for the teachings of Luther and the later reformers, eventually giving rise to the various Protestant denominations we know today.
