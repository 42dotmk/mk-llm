The distribution of power between the center and the state in the Indian Constitution is based on the federal scheme that efficiently adopts various features of multiple federal structures. The Indian federal system draws its inspiration primarily from British, Canadian, and Australian models.

The Constitution of India incorporates three lists in its Seventh Schedule: Union List, State List, and Concurrent List. These lists define the division of powers and responsibilities shared between the center and the state governments. This clear demarcation of powers provides the fundamental framework that upholds the autonomy of states while preserving the essence of a federal structure.

1. Union List: The Union List comprises subjects on which only the central government (also known as the union government) can make laws or take decisions. Some of these subjects include defense, atomic energy, foreign affairs, railways, air transport, naval ports, and communication. Since these matters are of national importance and require uniform policies, it is imperative for the central government to maintain control over them without state interference.

2. State List: The State List contains subjects that fall under the authority of the respective state governments. These subjects include public health, agriculture, land, police, local government, weights and measures, and gambling. The center plays no direct role in the legislation over these subjects. However, in cases of emergencies like national security or a breakdown of constitutional machinery within a state, the central government can intervene and enact legislation under the President's Rule.

3. Concurrent List: The Concurrent List includes subjects that allow the central and state governments to make laws together. Some of these subjects are criminal law, bankruptcy, marriage and divorce, bankruptcy and insolvency, price control, and trusts. In the case of a conflict between the central and state laws over a subject in the Concurrent List, the central law prevails.

The Indian Constitution also provides provisions for the division of financial resources between the center and the states. Article 268 to 281 of the Indian Constitution governs the distribution of revenue and taxes between the two levels of government. In addition to these provisions, the Finance Commission is established every five years to advise the President on the distribution of taxes between the center and states, thereby ensuring a fair degree of financial autonomy to the state governments.

Moreover, the Supreme Court of India plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of power between the center and state governments. It acts as the guardian of the Constitution and settles disputes that arise on the interpretation of the Constitution or federal laws. The Court ensures that the powers are wielded within the limits prescribed by the Constitution.

In conclusion, the distribution of power between the center and state in the Indian Constitution is based on a federal scheme that borrows features from multiple federal structures. A combination of the Union, State, and Concurrent Lists, financial provisions, the mechanism of Finance Commission, and the role of the Supreme Court facilitates an equilibrium of power and responsibilities between both levels of government while preserving the unity and diversity of the Indian nation.
