Title: Behind the Facade

Genre: Mystery/Thriller

Plot:

Act I:

Chloe Thompson, a successful lawyer in her mid-thirties, lives in a quiet suburban neighborhood with her husband, Tom, a renowned real estate developer. Though they seem to have an idyllic life from the outside, their marriage is strained due to Tom's intense work schedule and Chloe's inability to come to terms with her childless status.

One day, Chloe's younger sister, Sophie, requests she and her new boyfriend, Stan, stay with Chloe and Tom for a couple of weeks while their apartment is being renovated. Chloe eagerly agrees, seeing this as an opportunity to bring some warmth back into her home and strengthen her bond with Sophie, whom she has drifted apart from over the years.

Act II:

Chloe quickly warms up to the easygoing and charming Stan, and the four of them spend quality time together. Stan, a part-time graphic designer, also seems to be interested in holistic healing, often recommending herbal supplements and remedies to Chloe and others in their group.

One night, after a particularly bad argument between Chloe and Tom, Stan suggests Chloe try a specific natural sleep aid to help her relax. Chloe accepts his suggestion and takes the concoction that Stan has given her but does not immediately go to sleep. Instead, she becomes disoriented and begins to experience distorted perceptions of reality.

As Chloe stumbles to her bedroom, she catches a glimpse of Stan rifling through Tom's office and finds evidence of Tom's involvement in a real estate fraud. Chloe tries to confront Stan, but her compromised state leaves her powerless as she collapses on the bed and drifts into unconsciousness.

Act III:

Chloe eventually wakes up, unsure whether what she saw was merely a hallucination or reality. She starts to become increasingly suspicious of Stan and starts investigating him and her husband's possible connection to the fraud.

Chloe, secretly working with her close friend and fellow attorney, Rachel, finds out that Stan has been drugging others and manipulating them to gain information and leverage on them. They also discover that Stan, having a criminal past, is blackmailing Tom for his illegal land deals.

When Chloe and Tom finally confront Stan and Sophie, they learn that Sophie was already aware of Stan's actions. Sophie, initially jealous of her sister's success and feeling betrayed by Chloe's lack of empathy regarding her own struggles, had agreed to involve Stan in their lives as revenge but later regrets her decision after witnessing the emotional toll it takes on Chloe.

Act IV:

Chloe, having gathered the necessary evidence, reports Stan's blackmailing and fraud to the police, and he is ultimately arrested. Sophie, though now estranged from Chloe, learns a life-changing lesson and takes responsibility for her actions.

Chloe agrees to support Tom during his legal proceedings, and they start attending couples' therapy to repair their damaged marriage. In the end, Chloe and Tom manage to work through their differences and rekindle their love for one another. As Chloe emerges stronger from the ordeal, she and Sophie also endeavor to repair their crumbling relationship and rebuild their bond as sisters. The movie concludes with Chloe, Tom, Sophie, and Rachel – all forever changed by this harrowing experience – resolving to move forward and strive for a better future.
