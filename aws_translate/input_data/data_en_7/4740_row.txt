Q: Alan likes to support music creators, so instead of downloading songs from the internet, he visits a record store once in a while. He decided now to buy 2 CDs by "The Dark", 1 CD by the creator "AVN", and 5 CDs that are mixes of songs from the 90s. The price of the "AVN" CD is $12 and it is half the price of one CD by "The Dark". The 5 CDs of 90s music cost is 40% of all the cost of all other CDs Alan is going to buy. How much will Alan have to pay for all the products?
A: If one "AVN" is half the price of one "The Dark" CD, that means one CD of "The Dark" costs 12 * 2 = $24. So for two "The Dark" CDs, Alan needs to pay 24 * 2 = $48. So all CDs cost by now 12 + 48 = $60. The 90s music CDs cost 40 / 100 * 60 = $24. That means for all CDs Alan needs to pay 60 + 24 = $84. The answer is 84.
Question: Bob drove for one and a half hours at 60/mph. He then hit construction and drove for 2 hours at 45/mph. How many miles did Bob travel in those 3 and a half hours?
Answer: Bob drove for 1.5 hour * 60 / mph = 90 miles. Bod drove for 2 hour * 45 / mph = 90 miles. In total Bob drove 90 + 90 miles = 180 miles. The answer is 180.
[Question]Justin needs to collect one flower for each classmate that is in his 2nd-grade class. It takes him on average 10 minutes to find a flower he likes. He has been gathering for 2 hours. Assuming he has lost 3 of the flowers he initially gathered, how many more minutes does he need to look if he has 30 classmates?
[Answer]If he gathers for 2 hours, the number of minutes gathering is 2 * 60 minutes per hour = 120 minutes of gathering flowers. Gathering for 120 minutes / 10 minutes per flower = 12 flowers gathered. If he gathers 12 flowers initially but lost 3, he has 12 - 3 = 9 flowers gathered and kept. Since he has 30 classmates total and has 9 flowers, he needs to gather 30 - 9 = 21 more flowers. Assuming it takes 10 minutes per flower, it will take him 10 * 21 = 210 minutes to gather the remaining 21 flowers needed. The answer is 210.
Q: The total number of lions in a park is twice the number of leopards in the same park. The number of elephants is half the combined number of lions and leopards. Calculate the total population of the three animals in the park if the number of lions is 200.
A: If there are 200 lions in the park, which is twice the number of leopards in the park, there are 200 / 2 = 100 leopards in the park. The total population of lions and leopards in the park is 200 lions + 100 leopards = 300. The number of elephants in the park is 1 / 2 the total population of lions and leopards; thus, there are 300 / 2 = 150 elephants in the park. There are a total of 150 + 300 = 450 animals in the park. The answer is 450.
Question: Uncle Lou was given four bags of peanuts to eat on his 2-hour plane flight. Each bag contains 30 peanuts. If he eats all of the peanuts during the flight, one at a time, consumed at equally spaced intervals, what is the length of time, in minutes, between eating each peanut?
Answer: Four bags of peanuts, with 30 peanuts per bag, is a total of 4 * 30 = 120 peanuts. Two hours is 60 * 2 = 120 minutes. Thus, consuming 120 peanuts, 1 at a time, at equally spaced intervals over two hours requires 120 / 120 = 1 minute intervals between peanuts. The answer is 1.
