[Question]Ajax is 80 kilograms. He is planning to lose some weight. Exercising for an hour will help him lose 1.5 pounds. If 1 kilogram is equal to 2.2 pounds How many pounds will he weigh if he exercises for 2 hours every day for two weeks?
[Answer]Ajax weighs 80 x 2.2 = 176 in pounds. He will lose 1.5 x 2 = 3 pounds per day. So he will lose 3 x 7 = 21 pounds per week. So, he will lose 21x 2 = 42 pounds after 2 weeks. Therefore, he will weigh 176 - 42 = 134 pounds after 2 weeks. The answer is 134.
Q: Robe's car broke and he used $10 from his savings to pay for the repair. Before the repair, he bought 2 kinds of spare parts. A corner light that costs twice the price of the repair fee, and two brake disks; each disk cost thrice the price of the corner light. After that, he had $480 savings left. How much money did Robe have saved before his car broke?
A: The corner light cost $10 x 2 = $20. Each brake disk costs $20 x 3 = $60. So, the total price of the brake disks is $60x 2 = $120. He spent $10 + $20 + $120 = $150 for the repair. Therefore, Robe has saved $480 + 150 = $630 before his car broke. The answer is 630.
Question: James started a food fight in his school's cafeteria, and the school administration is making him work off the cost of all the food he wasted at minimum wage ($8). James has to pay for 20 wasted pounds of meat at $5/pound, 15 wasted pounds of fruits and vegetables at $4/pound, 60 wasted pounds of bread products at $1.50/pound, and 10 hours of time-and-a-half pay for the janitorial staff, who normally make $10/hour. How many hours will James have to work to pay for everything?
Answer: First find the total cost of the wasted meat: $5 / pound * 20 pounds = $100. Then find the total cost of the wasted vegetables: $4 / pound * 15 pounds = $60. Then find the total cost of the wasted bread products: $1.50 / pound * 60 pounds = $90. Then find the time - and - a - half rate for the janitors: $10 / hour * 1.5 = $15 / hour. Then multiply that by the number of hours to find the total janitorial cost: $15 / hour * 10 hours = $150. Then add up all the costs to find the total cost of everything: $100 + $60 + $90 + $150 = $400. Then divide the total James owes by his hourly wage to find how many hours he needs to work: $400 / $8 / hour = 50 hours. The answer is 50.
[Question]Isabella has three times as many green houses as yellow houses. She also has 40 fewer yellow houses than red houses. If she has 90 green houses, how many of her houses are not yellow?
[Answer]If the number of green houses is three times the number of yellow houses, and there are 90 green houses, then there are 90 / 3 = 30 yellow houses. She also has 40 fewer yellow houses than blue houses, meaning there are 30 + 40 = 70 blue houses. The number of houses that are not yellow is 70 blue houses + 90 green houses = 160. The answer is 160.
