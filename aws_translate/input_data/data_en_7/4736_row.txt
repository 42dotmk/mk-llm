Reasoning and answer: The total length cut from the 51 - meter ribbon is 100 x 15 centimeters = 1500 centimeters. Since 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters, then 1500 centimeters is equal to 1500 / 100 = 15 meters. Therefore, 51 - 15 = 36 meters of ribbon remains.
The answer: 36

They sold 221 regular size rubber ducks at $3.00 each so they made 221 * 3 = $663.00. They sold 185 large rubber ducks at $5.00 each so they made 185 * 5 = $925.00. The regular size ducks brought in $663.00 and the large brought in $925.00 for a total of 663 + 925 = $1,588.00 for charity.
The answer: 1588
Reverse engineering the question: The city is holding its annual rubber duck race for charity. The regular size rubber ducks are $3.00 each and the large size rubber duck is $5.00 each.

Regina has 4 pigs / cow * 20 cows = 80 pigs. She could sell the pigs for 80 pigs * $400 / pig = $32000. For the cows Regina would get 20 cows * $800 / cow = $16000. In total Regina would earn $16000 + $32000 = $48000.
The answer: 48000

Reasoning and answer: First find the total number of petunias: 4 flats * 8 petunias / flat = 32 petunias. Then find the total number of roses: 3 flats * 6 roses / flat = 18 roses. Now find how much fertilizer Seymour needs for the petunias: 32 petunias * 8 oz / petunia = 256 oz. Now find how much fertilizer Seymour needs for the roses: 18 roses * 3 oz / rose = 54 oz. Now find how much fertilizer Seymour needs for the Venus flytraps: 2 Venus flytraps * 2 oz / Venus flytrap = 4 oz. Now add up the fertilizer for all three plants: 256 oz + 54 oz + 4 oz = 314 oz.
The answer: 314
