(2). Logan uses more grounds.

The coffee that Michael makes is usually weaker than that of Logan because Logan uses more grounds. Logan's love for the rich and bold flavor of coffee has led him to experiment with various coffee beans and brewing techniques over the years. His passion and experience gave him a particular edge over Michael, who tended to rely on basic recipes and coffee-making methods.

Logan's choice of using more grounds per cup of water directly impacted the flavor of the coffee he brewed. With a deeper understanding of the perfect coffee-to-water ratio, he discovered that using more grounds produced a stronger and more flavorful cup. This methodology made his coffee taste fuller and more robust than Michael's, who often underestimates the importance of the coffee grounds and their effect on the final result.

Being an enthusiastic coffee connoisseur, Logan also appreciated the value of high-quality beans. He made sure to purchase beans from reputable sources and roast them just before grinding them to a precise consistency. Michael, on the other hand, wasn't as particular about his choice of beans. He would typically buy pre-ground coffee from the supermarket, which did not hold the same freshness or flavor as Logan's freshly ground beans.

Moreover, Logan had a knack for finding the best brewing method for each type of coffee bean. He was continually refining his techniques to draw out the unique flavors and nuances of different varieties. Michael, on the other hand, always used a basic drip coffee maker. While it was convenient and straightforward, it could not compete with the results of Logan's more hands-on techniques, such as the pour-over or French press method.

When it came down to it, Michael's coffee was not terrible by any means. However, it was always lighter and more watery than Logan's, which boasted an unmistakable intensity and rich flavor. Their friends certainly noticed the difference when they were invited over for a cup and would often tease Michael about his inferior brew.

Eventually, Michael became curious about Logan's methods and decided to ask him for some pointers. Surprised that he had taken such an interest, Logan agreed to teach Michael the art of making the perfect cup of coffee. They spent many afternoons together, perfecting Michael's technique and searching for the ideal coffee-to-water ratio.

In time, Michael began to appreciate the intricacies of coffee making and started to develop a genuine passion for the craft. With Logan's guidance, he explored new beans, experimented with different grinding consistencies, and even invested in a better coffee maker.

As Michael continued to improve his skills, the friendly competition between him and Logan only grew stronger. They would often host coffee-tasting parties, where friends would come to sample their latest brews and vote on their favorite. Though Logan's coffee still reigned supreme, Michael's newfound expertise gradually narrowed the gap separating their brews.

In the end, the two friends bonded over their mutual love for coffee, sharing tips and techniques while perfecting their craft. Michael's days of weaker coffee were behind him, and even though Logan's brew remained the crowd favorite, Michael was now able to serve a cup of coffee he was proud of. Their friendly rivalry not only enhanced their knowledge and enjoyment of coffee but also deepened their friendship.
