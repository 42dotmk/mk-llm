[Question]Sara and Joe have a combined height of 120 inches. Joe is 6 inches more than double Sara's height. How tall is Joe?
[Answer]Let x be Sara's height in inches. Joe is 6 + 2x inches tall. 120 = x + (6 + 2x). 120 = 3x + 6. 114 = 3x. x = 38 inches. Joe is 6 + 2(38) = 82 inches. The answer is 82.
Q: Alvin is selling his marble set. He has 100 marbles. 20% are white, 30% are black, and the rest are different colors. He sells the white ones for a nickel each, the black ones for a dime each, and the colors for $0.20 each. How much does he earn?
A: He has 20 white marbles because 100 x .2 = 20. He has 30 black marbles because 100 x .3 = 30. He has 50 color marbles because 100 - 20 - 30 = 50. He earns $1 from white marbles because 20 x .05 = 1. He earns $3 from the black marbles because 30 x .1 = 3. He earns $10 from the colors because 50 x .2 = 10. He earns $14 in total because 1 + 3 + 10 = 14. The answer is 14.
Question: Chrystalâ€™s vehicle speed is 30 miles per hour. Ascending the mountain decreases its speed by fifty percent, and descending the mountain increases its speed by twenty percent. If the distance going to the top of the mountain is 60 miles and the distance going down to the foot of the mountain is 72 miles, how many hours will Crystal have to pass the whole mountain?
Answer: The vehicle's speed decreases to 30 x 0.50 = 15 miles per hour when ascending to the top of the mountain. So, the total time Crystal will have to spend going to the top of the mountain is 60 / 15 = 4 hours. And the speed of the vehicle increases by 30 x 0.20 = 6 miles per hour when going down to the foot of the mountain. So, the total speed of the vehicle when going down is 30 + 6 = 36 miles per hour. Thus, Chrystal will have to spend 72 / 36 = 2 hours to descend from the mountain. Therefore, the total hours she will spend to pass the whole mountain is 4 + 2 = 6 hours. The answer is 6.
[Question]Daria just got a new credit card so she could buy some furniture. Daria has $500 saved ready to pay for the furniture she buys, but the rest of the money will have to stay on her credit card statement until the next month, when she can pay it off with interest. She bought a couch for $750, a table for $100 and a lamp for $50. After she pays the initial $500, how much does she still owe before interest?
[Answer]Daria spends $750 + $100 + $50 on furniture = $900 total on furniture. Of that $900 she spent, she can pay $500 now, so $900 - $500 = $400 that Daria still owes. The answer is 400.
Q: Carmen is selling girl scout cookies. She sells three boxes of samoas to the green house for $4 each; two boxes of thin mints for $3.50 each and one box of fudge delights for $5 to the yellow house; and nine boxes of sugar cookies for $2 each to the brown house. How much money did Carmen make?
A: Carmen earned 3 * $4 = $12 at the green house. She earned 2 * $3.50 = $7 for the mints. She earned $7 + $5 = $12 at the yellow house. She earned 9 * $2 = $18 at the brown house. So, Carmen earned a total of $12 + $12 + 18 = $42. The answer is 42.
