Q: Abby is building 2 raised beds to grow vegetables. The beds are both 8 feet long, 4 feet wide and 1 foot high. Each bag of soil has 4 cubic feet. How many bags of soil will she need?
A: One garden bed measures 8ft long, 4ft wide and 1ft high so to find the cubic feet needed, 8 * 4 * 1 = 32 cubic feet of soil needed. Both beds are the same size so she needs 2 * 32 = 64 cubic feet of soil. Every bag has 4 cubic feet of soil and she needs 64 cubic feet so 64 / 4 = 16 bags needed. The answer is 16.
Question: A movie theater charges $5 for matinee tickets, $7 for evening tickets, and $10 for opening night tickets. A bucket of popcorn costs $10. On Friday, they had 32 matinee customers, 40 evening customers, and 58 customers for an opening night showing of a movie. If half the customers bought popcorn, how much money in dollars did the theater make on Friday night?
Answer: The movie theater made 5 * 32 = $160 in matinee tickets. It made 7 * 40 = $280 in evening tickets. It made 10 * 58 = $580 in opening night tickets. There were 32 + 40 + 58 = 130 customers. Half of the customers bought popcorn, so 130 / 2 = 65 bought popcorn. Thus, the theater made 10 * 65 = $650 from popcorn. Therefore, in all, the theater made 160 + 280 + 580 + 650 = $1670 on Friday night. The answer is 1670.
[Question]Emma and Briana invested some capital into a business. Emma's investment is supposed to yield 15% of the capital annually while Briana's should yield 10% annually. If Emma invested $300 and Briana invested $500, what will be the difference between their return-on-investment after 2 years?
[Answer]15% of $300 is (15 / 100) * $300 = $45. Emma will earn an annual ROI of $45 for 2 years for a total of $45 * 2 = $90. 10% of $500 is (10 / 100) * $500 = $50. Briana will earn an annual ROI of $50 for 2 years for a total of $50 * 2 = $100. The difference between their ROI after 2 years is $100 - $90 = $10. The answer is 10.
Q: Mary is paying her monthly garbage bill for a month with exactly four weeks. The garbage company charges Mary $10 per trash bin and $5 per recycling bin every week, and Mary has 2 trash bins and 1 recycling bin. They're giving her an 18% discount on the whole bill before fines for being elderly, but also charging her a $20 fine for putting inappropriate items in a recycling bin. How much is Mary's garbage bill?
A: First find how much Mary pays weekly for the trash bins: $10 / trash bin * 2 trash bins = $20. Then add this to the cost of the recycling bin: $20 + $5 = $25. Then multiply the week cost by the number of weeks per month to find the monthly cost: $25 / week * 4 weeks / month = $100 / month. Now calculate Mary's senior discount: 18% * $100 = $18. Now subtract the discount and add the fine to find the total monthly cost: $100 - $18 + $20 = $102. The answer is 102.
