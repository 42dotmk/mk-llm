These questions are not the same as they pertain to different aspects of India-Pakistan relations and the Kargil War. Let's address the questions individually.

1. What can Pakistan achieve by attacking India? What was Pakistan's aim during the Kargil War?

Pakistan attacking India can have various aims, depending largely on the context and historical background. However, any such action would likely result in severe repercussions. In the specific context of the Kargil War:

The Kargil War took place between May and July 1999 in the Kargil district of Kashmir and elsewhere along the Line of Control (LOC) between India and Pakistan. The primary aim of Pakistan's incursion into Indian-controlled territory was to internationalize the Kashmir issue and facilitate the resolution of the contentious dispute. Pakistan hoped that by occupying strategic heights in the Kargil region, it would not only force India to negotiate on Pakistan's terms but also alter the dynamics of the long-standing conflict.

At the same time, another objective was to cut off Indian supply lines and put pressure on India's strategic military points in the region. By doing so, Pakistan aimed to weaken the Indian forces, divert their attention from the insurgency in the Kashmir Valley, and potentially force a redeployment of troops.

2. Why didn't India continue its attack on Pakistan after the latter withdrew to the LOC in the Kargil War? Who intervened and why?

India did not continue its attack on Pakistan after the Kargil War for several reasons:

a. Diplomacy: During the war, both countries faced immense international pressure to end hostilities and resolve the crisis diplomatically. Notably, the United States, led by then-President Bill Clinton, intervened in the conflict, urging Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to withdraw Pakistani forces back across the Line of Control (LOC). India, too, faced international pressure to halt its offensive once Pakistan had withdrawn to prevent any further escalation.

b. Ceasefire: India achieved its primary objective of reestablishing control over the Kargil district and restore the pre-war status quo. A continuation of hostilities could have resulted in significant losses for both sides, potentially leading to a full-scale war and a major regional crisis.

c. Escalation risks: The nuclear capabilities of both countries also played a decisive role in preventing further escalation. Any prolonged and intensified conflict could have heightened the risk of a nuclear confrontation, considering that both India and Pakistan had conducted nuclear tests in 1998.

d. War costs: Wars typically have financial and human costs, and both countries were aware of this reality. Continued hostilities would have put strain on their respective economies, military resources, and, in turn, their civilian populations that would bear the war's burden.

In summary, while the questions provided touch upon aspects related to the Kargil war between India and Pakistan, they are not the same. The first question relates to the potential aims of Pakistan in attacking India and their objectives during the Kargil War. The second question delves into the reasons behind India's decision not to continue the attack after Pakistan withdrew its forces. Both questions shed light on different aspects of a complex and multi-faceted conflict, revealing the intricate nature of India-Pakistan relations.
