[Question]It takes 320 rose petals to make an ounce of perfume. If each rose produces 8 petals, and there are 12 roses per bush, how many bushes will Fern have to harvest to make 20 12-ounce bottles of perfume?
[Answer]First find the number of roses needed for one ounce of perfume: 320 petals / 8 petals / rose = 40 roses. Then multiply the number of roses needed for one ounce by the number of ounces per bottle to find the number of roses per bottle: 40 roses / ounce * 12 ounces / bottle = 480 roses / bottle. Then multiply that number by the number of bottles to find the total number of roses needed: 480 roses / bottle * 20 bottles = 9600 roses. Then divide that number by the number of roses per bush to find the number of bushes Fern needs to harvest: 9600 roses / 12 roses / bush = 800 bushes. The answer is 800.

Question: 40% of the mosquitos in Jack's area are infected with malaria. 20% of the mosquitos are infected with Zika virus. Without a vaccine, the chances of getting infected with either virus after getting bitten by an infected mosquito are 50%. Jack is taking an experimental malaria vaccine that reduces the chances of getting infected after getting bitten by 50%. If Jack gets bitten by a random mosquito, what is the percentage chance he catches either Zika virus or malaria?
Answer: First find Jack's chances of getting bitten by an infected mosquito: 40% + 20% = 60%. The chance of being infected by a mosquito with after being bitten: 60% * 50% = 30%. Then find the chances of getting ill after receiving the vaccine: 30% * 50% = 15%. The answer is 15.
[Question]A company is hosting a seminar. So far, 30 attendees from company A have been registered; company B has twice the number of attendees of company A; company C has 10 more attendees than company A; company D has 5 fewer attendees than company C. If a total of 185 attendees have registered, how many attendees who registered are not from either company A, B, C or D?
[Answer]There are 30 x 2 = 60 attendees from company B. Company C has 30 + 10 = 40 attendees. Company D has 40 - 5 = 35 registered attendees. So, the total attendees from company A, B, C, and D is 30 + 60 + 40 + 35 = 165. Therefore there are 185 - 165 = 20 attendees that are not from companies A, B, C, or D. The answer is 20.
Q: At Sarah's job 60% of the employees are women and the rest are men. Of the men, 75% have a college degree and 8 do not. How many women work at Sarah's company?
A: 25% of men at the job don't have a college degree because 100 - 75 = 25. There are 32 men at the company because 8 / .25 = 32. 40% of the employees are men because 100 - 60 = 40. The company has 80 workers because 32 / .4 = 80. There are 48 women at the company because 80 - 32 = 48. The answer is 48.
