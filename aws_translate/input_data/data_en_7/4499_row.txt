Making Amatriciana with clams is relatively simple, but requires some variations from the traditional Amatriciana sauce. Here's a step-by-step guide for preparing the dish. 

Ingredients:
- 400g pasta (spaghetti or linguine)
- 400g canned crushed tomatoes (or fresh tomatoes, peeled and chopped)
- 200g pancetta (or guanciale), diced
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 tsp red pepper flakes (adjust according to your liking)
- 1/2 cup white wine
- 1 kg fresh clams, cleaned and scrubbed
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 2-3 tbsp olive oil
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnishing)
- Grated Pecorino Romano cheese (optional)

Steps:

1. Prepare all ingredients: Having all your ingredients ready before preparing the dish is essential. Start by chopping the onion, mincing the garlic, dicing the pancetta, and cleaning the clams.

Step justification: This prevents any delay while cooking, ensuring that all ingredients are at the right temperature when adding them to the dish.

2. Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, following the package instructions. Drain and set aside.

Step justification: Cooking the pasta separately ensures that it doesn't become overcooked while you are preparing the sauce and clams.

3. Prepare the sauce: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the pancetta and cook until crispy. Remove the pancetta and set aside on a paper towel-lined plate.

Step justification: Frying pancetta first helps release its fat, which will add flavor to the sauce, and also creates crispy bits for added texture.

4. In the same skillet, add the onion and cook until softened and slightly golden. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes, cooking for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

Step justification: Cooking onions first softens them and adds sweetness, while cooking garlic and red pepper flakes with onions prevents burning and adds flavor.

5. Stir in the canned crushed tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Cook the sauce over low heat for 10-15 minutes to allow flavors to meld and develop.

Step justification: Simmering the sauce cooks out any raw tomato taste and helps to infuse flavors from the other ingredients.

6. Cook the clams: In a separate pan, heat a little olive oil over medium heat. Add the clams, white wine, and a pinch of salt. Cover and cook until the clams open, around 5-7 minutes. Discard any unopened clams.

Step justification: Cooking the clams separately in white wine infuses them with flavor and ensures they cook evenly.

7. Combine everything: Once the sauce is ready, gently fold the cooked clams and their juices into the sauce. Add the cooked pasta and pancetta to the sauce, and toss everything together to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce.

Step justification: Combining all ingredients ensures that the flavors meld, creating a cohesive and delicious Amatriciana with clams dish.

8. Taste and adjust seasoning: Add salt and pepper to taste.

Step justification: Adjusting seasoning ensures that the final dish is balanced and flavorful.

9. Serve and garnish: Plate the pasta and sauce, garnishing with freshly chopped parsley and grated Pecorino Romano cheese, if desired.

Step justification: Garnishing the dish with parsley adds a pop of color and fresh flavor, while the cheese adds a salty, savory touch.

Enjoy your Amatriciana with clams!
