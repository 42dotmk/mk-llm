(B). Samantha could save it.

The sun was setting when Natalie accidentally hit a possum while driving her car through the woods. Horrified, she pulled over and checked on the small animal. To her relief, the possum was still alive, but appeared to be in pain. She knew she couldn't just leave it there with possible severe injuries, so she quickly pulled out her phone to see if there was a nearby veterinary clinic. Fortunately, she found one not too far away, Samantha's Veterinary Clinic, and immediately decided she had to make the drive, hoping Samantha could save the injured creature.

Natalie carefully wrapped the possum in a soft blanket she had in her car and placed it on the passenger seat. Throughout the drive to the clinic, she kept glancing back to make sure it was still alive while following the GPS directions. After an anxious 10 minutes, Natalie made it to the clinic just as Samantha was preparing to close for the day.

Upon seeing Natalie carrying the injured animal, Samantha could tell this was an emergency. She reopened her clinic and warmly welcomed Natalie inside. The possum was now laid on the examination table, its shallow breaths indicative of the pain it was experiencing. Samantha gently inspected the animal, noting the fractures in its legs and a few scratches on its body.

Samantha explained to Natalie that the possum would require surgery to repair the fractures, and would then need time to recover under her care. Grateful to have found someone who was willing to help, Natalie agreed to bear the cost of the procedure, even though she knew it could be expensive.

The veterinarian swiftly prepped the operating room while Natalie waited nervously in the reception area. Samantha's knowledge and experience shone through as she meticulously operated on the possum, working steadily to repair the broken bones and suture its wounds. Although it took a couple of hours, the surgery was a success. Samantha administered some pain medication and antibiotics to the possum, ensuring its recovery would be as comfortable as possible.

Days went by, and Natalie regularly called Samantha to receive updates on the possum's progress. Under Samantha's watchful eye and expert care, the animal began to recuperate faster than anticipated. It wasn't long before the possum was ready to venture back into the wild.

On the day of its release, Natalie met Samantha at the clinic, her heart swelling with joy at the prospect of returning the small creature to its home. Together, they drove back to the spot in the woods where the accident had occurred. Holding the possum in her arms, Natalie could feel the animal's eagerness to return to its natural habitat.

With tears in her eyes, she thanked Samantha profusely for her kindness and dedication in saving the possum's life. The two women watched as the possum scurried into the underbrush, disappearing into the thick woodland.

Natalie knew that Samantha's veterinary expertise had turned a potential tragedy into a heartwarming story - a story she'd treasure for years to come. As the sun began to set, they stood amidst the trees, a gentle evening breeze rustling the leaves around them. The events unfolding in the last few days reminded them of the importance of compassion, empathy, and the power of working together to make a difference in the lives of others, regardless of how small or inconsequential it may seem to some.
