(II) yes;

Both questions address the concern of recognizing and identifying "true" friends in one's life. Your question is not a multi-choice problem but rather an inquiry seeking guidance in understanding the meaning of genuine friendship and identifying true friends. I will provide a detailed answer to help you evaluate your relationships and determine if you have true friends.

Having true friends can enrich one's life significantly. A true friend is someone who is there with you during both the good times and the bad times, showing support, understanding, and companionship. They genuinely care about your well-being, listen to you, and respect your opinions and feelings. True friends can be hard to come by, but they are certainly worth cherishing. To determine if you have true friends, consider examining your relationships using the following criteria:

1. Trustworthiness: True friends are trustworthy and reliable. They do not betray your trust or share your personal information and secrets with others. They keep their promises and are honest with you, even when it is difficult to do so.

2. Loyalty: True friends are loyal and stand by you during hard times. They do not abandon you when things are tough or engage in gossip about you behind your back. They defend you when someone tries to mistreat or disrespect you.

3. Emotional support: True friends provide emotional support when you need it. They listen to your concerns, empathize with your feelings, and offer encouragement and advice if you ask for it. They are genuinely happy for your successes and share your sorrows when you face difficulties.

4. Mutual interests: True friends often share mutual interests and engage in activities together. While it is not necessary to have all the same hobbies, common interests can cement the bond between friends.

5. Reciprocity: True friendship involves a balance of give and take. Both parties should contribute to the relationship. A true friend does not always expect you to be the one to make sacrifices, nor do they take advantage of your kindness.

6. Open communication: True friends communicate openly and honestly. They respect your opinions and feelings, and they are comfortable discussing difficult topics with you. They value your perspective and do not shy away from addressing conflicts or differences in opinion.

7. Personal growth: True friends support and encourage your personal growth. They challenge you to become a better person, celebrate your achievements, and offer constructive feedback to help you improve where necessary.

8. Shared history: Long-time friends who have been through various life experiences together can forge a strong bond that is hard to break. This shared history serves as a foundation for the friendship and helps nurture trust, understanding, and appreciation for one another.

9. Acceptance: True friends accept you for who you are, without judgment or conditions. They appreciate your quirks and unique qualities and celebrate your individuality.

To determine if you have true friends, you can reflect on your relationships based on these criteria. Ask yourself if your friends possess these qualities, and if you also offer the same in return. Genuine friendships are built on mutual understanding, trust, support, and respect. When you have true friends, you confidently know that they are there for you, just as you are there for them.
