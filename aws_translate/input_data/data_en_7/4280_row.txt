"Gain speed" is an answer aligned with human common sense due to several factors rooted in our understanding of the physical world and the laws that govern it. When examining the given scenario, a round object rolling down a ramp, we can analyze different aspects, such as the object's shape, as well as the incline and surface of the ramp, which all contribute to the object gaining speed. The basic principles of motion, gravity, and friction can help elucidate why "gain speed" is the most logical and sensible answer when compared to the other options provided.

1. Principles of motion: According to Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion, particularly the first law (the law of inertia), an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue to move in a straight line with constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. In this case, gravity and the inclined plane provide the external forces necessary to set the round object into motion and alter its velocity.

2. Gravity: Gravity is a natural force that attracts two objects with mass toward each other. In the context of our scenario, gravity pulls the round object downwards, causing it to accelerate along the incline of the ramp. The gravitational force provides the means for the object to change its velocity (i.e., gain speed) as it rolls down the ramp.

3. Round shape: A round object, such as a ball or a wheel, has a property called rotational inertia that allows it to roll smoothly and easily along surfaces. This property minimizes friction and other resistive forces, allowing the object to maintain or increase its speed as it moves. Additionally, round objects have no corners or edges that would create drag or limit the effectiveness of the motion down the ramp.

4. Inclined plane: The inclined plane of the ramp serves as a key factor in the round object gaining speed. From a human common sense standpoint, a ramp provides a slope that makes it easier for objects to move downwards due to gravity. This is in contrast to a flat or uphill surface, which does not facilitate the same acceleration effect. The steeper the incline, the greater the rate at which the round object will gain speed.

5. Friction: The natural force of friction interacts between the round object and the ramp's surface, opposing the object's motion. However, the object's round shape and the inclined plane typically allow it to overcome this resistive force and gain speed more effectively than if it had a different shape or were on a flat surface.

Comparing this to the other given answers, "sound well" is not relevant to the situation, as it pertains to audio, not movement. "Fly" suggests that the round object would become airborne, which isn't a typical or expected outcome in this scenario. "Become broken" implies that the rolling movement would damage the object, which, unless the object is extremely fragile or there is some external force, is not necessarily true in all circumstances, while "fall into a hole" assumes the presence of a hole, which is not explicitly mentioned in the scenario.

Hence, taking into account the principles of motion, gravity, the object's shape, and the inclined plane, "gain speed" is the answer most closely aligned with human common sense. It corresponds to our everyday experience and understanding of how round objects behave when they roll down inclined surfaces.
