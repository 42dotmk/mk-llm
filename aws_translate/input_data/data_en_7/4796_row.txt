Cameron needed better evaluation for the athletes for several reasons that can be attributed to achieving improved outcomes in the sporting environment, enhancing their individual growth, and optimizing the overall team performance. By dividing the athletes into different classes, Cameron demonstrated an understanding of the benefits of a targeted and specialized approach to athlete evaluation and development. Here are some of the main reasons why Cameron sought better evaluation:

1. Identification of individual strengths and weaknesses: By dividing the athletes into different classes, Cameron can focus on assessing and identifying their unique attributes, including their strengths and areas that need improvement. This will allow them to work on tailored programs and develop strategies that help them advance their skills and minimize their weaknesses.

2. Personalized training and development: Once the athletes' individual characteristics and performance levels have been determined, the coaching staff can create specialized training programs that cater to their specific needs. This approach to training will enable athletes to progress at their own pace and ensure optimal development in their respective disciplines.

3. Balanced team composition: Cameron's divide-and-evaluate method will help identify the right mix of skill sets required for a strong and cohesive team. By understanding each athlete's potential, Cameron can assemble a well-rounded group that complements each other's abilities and supports the overall goals of the team.

4. Early detection of talent: This method of evaluation can help in identifying promising athletes early on in their sporting careers. By grouping them according to their skill levels and adequately evaluating their progress, Cameron can provide the necessary guidance to nurture their talents and help them reach their full potential.

5. Better performance tracking: Evaluating the athletes in a targeted manner will allow for more accurate and comprehensive performance measurement. Coaches and administrators can track each athlete's progress, compare it with other athletes in the same class, and adjust the training accordingly to ensure that they are all on the right path.

6. Increased motivation and engagement: Athletes who feel understood and valued by their coaches are more likely to be motivated and engaged in their training. By investing time and effort in understanding each athlete's unique capabilities, Cameron is fostering a positive and supportive environment that encourages growth and success.

7. Greater competitiveness: In the world of sports, every edge counts, and better evaluation plays a vital role in staying ahead of the competition. By having a deeper understanding of the athletes and consistently working on improving their abilities, the team will be better prepared for competitions and will increase its chances of performing well.

In summary, Cameron's decision to divide the athletes into different classes for better evaluation demonstrates a commitment to the holistic development and growth of the athletes, as well as towards the overall success of the team. By doing so, Cameron can ensure that the diverse needs and potentials of the athletes are recognized and addressed, leading to a highly competitive and well-rounded group of individuals who are equipped to face challenges head-on and achieve success in their respective sports.
