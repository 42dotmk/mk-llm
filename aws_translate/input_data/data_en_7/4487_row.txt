Caroline was unhappy with her ability to focus on the project at hand. It seemed like an odd sensation, bothersome and profoundly distracting. She knew it was crucial for her to give her all to this task, but her mind kept wandering. Caroline couldn't help but feel that something was amiss, and she couldn't shake the nagging sensation that she was being watched.

Angelo, her project partner, seemed to be doing just fine. He was inherently focused and dedicated to the project, almost unnaturally so. Seeing how engrossed Angelo was, Caroline couldn't help but feel slightly frustrated by her own inadequacy in concentrating. She sought his guidance, hoping he could offer some words of wisdom. Instead, Angelo remained distant, ignoring her attempts at seeking help and advice. He buried himself in the work at hand, leaving Caroline to flounder on her own.

As she tried to refocus her mind on the project, Caroline would sometimes catch herself daydreaming about the peculiar set of circumstances that surrounded them. The project they were working on was funded by an enigmatic company, with very specific instructions on timing and logistics. They were stationed in a small town, where the locals seemed to hold a variety of secrets.

One of the most mysterious figures in town was Jobe Smith. An eccentric individual, Jobe lived in a garden shed located on the property of the local parish, the shed owned by the priest of the town. Jobe had struck a unique deal with the priest, who offered him shelter in return for performing maintenance and upkeep on the property. Rumors about Jobe's peculiar past swirled around town, creating an air of mystique and intrigue.

In the midst of all the whispers, it was difficult not to notice that Jobe was tied to another notable character in town, McKeen's brother. The brother was a jack-of-all-trades, requiring someone with equally diverse skills to assist him with various odd jobs that were too time-consuming or laborious to handle on his own. With his murky past and his resourceful demeanour, Jobe seemed to be the perfect fit for this role. He would often be seen at McKeen's brother's side, working together with him on tasks ranging from plumbing to landscaping.

As the work on the project carried on, Caroline and Angelo began to feel the pressure mounting. Struggling to find a sense of balance between her frustration and concern, Caroline tried to focus on the tasks at hand. Unknown to them, however, their progress was closely monitored by an unseen party. The project director, employed by a mysterious agency known as The Shop, had vested interests in seeing the project through to completion. Tasked with keeping tabs on the experiment, the agency operated mere ghosts, providing Caroline with an unexpectedly substantial reason for her unnerving feelings of being watched.

As Caroline and Angelo continue to work on the project, the presence of The Shop looms large above them, unseen but influential. The vibrant characters of Jobe Smith and McKeen's brother provide texture to a small town with secrets tucked away within its walls. In this remote corner of the world, the individual private struggles of Caroline and Angelo become entwined with the larger machinations of shadowy organizations and enigmatic figures, ultimately weaving a tale that highlights the complexity of human experiences and the mysterious nature of the world around us.
