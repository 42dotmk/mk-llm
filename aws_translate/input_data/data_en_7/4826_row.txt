Movie Plot:

Dr. James Norton is a psychiatrist who has devoted his life to helping his patients overcome their inner demons at Woodhaven Psychiatric Hospital. The hospital has a history of enigmatic deaths, but the staff is tight-lipped about the events. When news breaks about the recent death of Isabel Thompson, an investigative journalist, John Harris, picks up the story.

John decides to go undercover as a maintenance worker at the hospital in an attempt to find the truth about Isabel's death. During his investigation, he discovers that Isabel had been admitted to the hospital by her family after she claimed to be haunted by the ghost of her twin sister.

As John infiltrates the hospital, he meets Anna Forbes, a nurse who is also disturbed by the series of unexplained deaths. Together, they uncover that Dr. Norton has developed an experimental treatment involving hypnosis and psychoactive drugs to access the deepest, darkest corners of patients' minds, ultimately leading to repressed memories resurfacing.

Isabel, during her treatments with Dr. Norton, had become increasingly paranoid and aggressive, claiming that her twin sister, who had died in a tragic accident years prior, continued to torment her. Despite Dr. Norton's attempts to suppress her claims, Isabel's condition deteriorated, culminating in her untimely death.

As John and Anna delve deeper into the mystery, they realize that some of the patients, including Isabel, had not only been subjected to the experimental treatments, but also to a harrowing form of psychological manipulation, turning them into unwitting participants in a series of brutal and deadly battles against their inner demons.

With the hospital's employees becoming increasingly suspicious of John's true intentions, a race against time ensues as John and Anna gather evidence to expose the horrifying truth behind the walls of Woodhaven Psychiatric Hospital and Isabel's tragic demise.

In a nail-biting climax, Dr. Norton confronts John and Anna about their meddling. He defends his methods by explaining that the patients' experiences were necessary for their rehabilitation. A tense struggle breaks out, during which Dr. Norton accidentally falls and suffers a fatal injury.

John and Anna, now in possession of evidence to expose the hospital's dark secrets, succeed in shutting down Woodhaven and ensuring the safety of its patients. The movie ends with the ghost of Isabel ascending peacefully into the afterlife, while John, Anna, and the surviving patients start the process of healing from their traumatic experiences.
