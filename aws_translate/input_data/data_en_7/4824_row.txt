[Question]A soccer team had 24 players prepared for a soccer game. The first half saw 11 players start the game with 2 substitutions made. In the second half, the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half. How many players on the team did not play that day?
[Answer]With two substitutions, 11 + 2 = 13 players from the team played the game in the first half. In the second half, the team made twice the number of substitutions it made in the first half, a total of 2 * 2 = 4 substitutions. The total number of players who played the game is 13 + 4 = 17. If the soccer team had 24 players prepared for the soccer game, the number of players who did not play the game is 24 - 17 = 7 players. The answer is 7.
Q: Jeff spends three times as many hours on the weekend catching up with his Facebook pals as he does working. Monday through Friday, however, he spends four times as many hours working as he does catching up. If he spends 3 hours every day catching up, how many hours does he spend working in an entire week?
A: On the weekend, Jeff works 3 / 3 = 1 hour each day. On the weekdays, he spends 4 * 3 = 12 hours working each day. Thus, he spends 2 * 1 + 5 * 12 = 62 hours working each week. The answer is 62.
Question: A family's water and electricity bills average $30 a month for the first 4 months and $24 a month for the last 2 months. If the family's bills were averaged over all 6 months, what would the average monthly bill be?
Answer: The sum of the bills of the family in the first 4 months is $30 / month x 4 months = $120. The sum of the bills of the family in the last 2 months is $24 / month x $2 = $48. The sum of the bills of the family over the 6 months is $120 + $48 = $168. Hence, their average monthly bill is $168 / 6 months = $28 / month. The answer is 28.
[Question]Zach was a waiter in a fancy restaurant. His last table for the night was a party for 4 people. The mom ordered lobster for $25.50, the dad ordered steak for $35.00 their twin boys both ordered a cheeseburger and fries for $13.50 each. They started their meal with an appetizer that cost 8.50. Everyone also ordered a dessert that cost $6.00 each. They wanted to give a 20% tip for Zach on the bill. What did the final bill total come to?
[Answer]The twins ordered a cheeseburger each so 2 * 13.50 = $27.00 for both cheeseburgers. Everyone ordered a dessert so 4 * 6 = $24.00 for dessert. When you add all the meals together they spent 25.50 + 35.00 + 27.00 + 8.50 + 24.00 = $120.00. Zach's tip was 20% so .20 * 120.00 = $24.00. When you add up the meals $120.00 and Zach's tip of $24.00 then the total cost is 120.00 + 24.00 = $144.00. The answer is 144.
