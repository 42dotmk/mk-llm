Title: The Tragic Case of Laurel Schlemmer: A Mother's Horrific Attempt to be a "Better Mother"

Introduction:

In a world where mothers are often seen as the epitome of love and protection for their children, the case of Laurel Schlemmer stands in stark contrast. At 40 years old, Schlemmer made the news headlines as a result of her tragic attempt to drown her youngest children, allegedly with the hope of becoming a better mother to her eldest son. The actions undertaken by Schlemmer have left a grieving family and appalled society grappling to understand the warped rationale behind her actions.

The Incident:

On the fateful day of the incident, Laurel Schlemmer decided that, in order to be a better mother to her seven-year-old son, she needed to drown her two youngest sons, aged 3 and 6. Luke Schlemmer, the three-year-old, lost his life after his mother allegedly sat on him while he was in the bathtub. His elder brother Daniel Schlemmer, aged 6, was put on life support with no brain activity after undergoing the same traumatic experience.

Confirmation of Brain Death:

The tragedy escalated when it was later confirmed that Daniel Schlemmer was brain dead. The lack of any response or activity emanating from the child's brain was a clear indication that he would never recover from his mother's actions. With no hope of revival, Daniel's life support was presumably removed, and his family was left to pick up the shattered pieces of their lives.

The 911 Call and Suicide Watch:

To compound the heartache, Mrs Schlemmer was interviewed by a 911 operator, to whom she provided a troubling account of the events leading up to her sons' drowning. She stated that while she was in the restroom, she left her sons to play in the bathtub. Upon returning to the bathroom, she claimed to have found her children unconscious. Whether or not this account was entirely accurate, it raises questions about the kind of support and supervision that were in place for the family.

Following her confession, it was reported that Laurel Schlemmer was placed on suicide watch. This implies that the authorities were concerned about the potential risk she posed to herself in the aftermath of these tragic events. While determining the cause of the incident, it is possible that mental health factors may have played a significant role in her actions.

An Earlier Incident:

Yet, this was not the first time that Laurel Schlemmer had caused harm to her children. In a worrying development, it was revealed that she backed over her sons with her van just one year prior to the drowning incident. This prior occurrence brings to light the question of whether this earlier event should have acted as a warning sign for Schlemmer's ability to care for and protect her children, or if adequate intervention and support were provided to the family at that time.

Conclusion:

The tragic case of Laurel Schlemmer and the devastating loss of her two youngest sons highlights the importance of understanding the extreme pressures that some parents face and ensuring that mental health care and support are accessible to struggling families. Furthermore, it serves as an essential reminder to remain vigilant and responsive to warning signs exhibited by caregivers, such as previous incidents of harm towards their children. Only when we learn to recognise and respond to these warning signs can we hope to prevent future tragedies of this nature.
