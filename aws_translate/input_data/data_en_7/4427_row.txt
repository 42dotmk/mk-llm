The ten lost tribes of Israel refer to the ten of the twelve tribes of ancient Israel who were said to have been exiled after the Assyrian conquest around 722 BCE. They are commonly believed to have dispersed throughout the ancient world, assimilating into the populations of various regions, and their descendants eventually lost sense of their original Israelite identity. However, historians and biblical scholars have debated the veracity of this account and the fate of the ten tribes, as well as searched for tangible evidence to determine their existence.

Nevertheless, according to the Hebrew Bible, the twelve tribes of Israel were descended from the twelve sons of the patriarch Jacob (who was also called Israel). Here is a list of the ten tribes considered "lost":

1. Reuben: This tribe was named after the firstborn son of Jacob and his wife Leah. The Tribe of Reuben occupied the area south of the Sea of Galilee at the northern region of the Dead Sea.

2. Simeon: The Tribe of Simeon, led by Jacob's second son with Leah, was originally located within the territory of Judah in the southern part of Israel.

3. Dan: Named after Jacob's fifth son, borne by Bilhah, Rachel's maid, the Tribe of Dan initially settled in the northwest coast of Israel, near the modern city of Tel Aviv, before eventually migrating north to avoid the Philistines.

4. Naphtali: Named after Jacob's sixth son with Bilhah, the Tribe of Naphtali settled in the northern part of Canaan, near the Sea of Galilee, and was known for its agricultural richness.

5. Gad: The Tribe of Gad descended from Jacob's seventh son, borne by Zilpah, Leah's maid. They settled on the eastern side of the Jordan River in modern-day Jordan, known for its grazing lands.

6. Asher: The Tribe of Asher stemmed from Jacob's eighth son with Zilpah. This tribe inhabited an area along the Mediterranean coast of present-day Lebanon, which today includes cities such as Tyre and Sidon.

7. Issachar: Named after Jacob's ninth son and fifth son with Leah, the Tribe of Issachar was located in the northern region of Israel's Jezreel Valley, famous for its fertile soil.

8. Zebulun: Descended from the tenth son of Jacob and Leah, the Tribe of Zebulun lived along the Mediterranean coast, south of the Phoenician city of Tyre.

9. Ephraim: The Tribe of Ephraim was established by one of the two sons of Joseph, Jacob's firstborn son with his wife Rachel. The tribe settled in a central part of Canaan, comprising the southern section of the present-day West Bank.

10. Manasseh: The other half of the tribe founded by Joseph's sons, the Tribe of Manasseh settled in the northern part of the West Bank and east of the Jordan River. The tribe itself was later divided into two half-tribes, preserving the original count of twelve tribes.

Throughout history, various groups have claimed descent from the lost tribes of Israel, sometimes as a means of legitimizing their ancestry or religious status. The two remaining tribes, Judah and Benjamin, made up the southern Kingdom of Judah, which was later conquered by the Babylonians. However, unlike the ten lost tribes, the descendants of Judah and Benjamin maintained their Israelite identity, eventually became known as the Jewish people, and their history is better documented. The search for the ten lost tribes remains an area of fascination for historians, archaeologists, and religious scholars.
