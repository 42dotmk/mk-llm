[Question]Stephanie is checking her household budget, and needs to calculate how much she has left to pay for her bills. Her electricity bill costs $60, and this is paid in full. Her gas bill was $40, and she has already paid three-quarters of this. She makes another payment of $5 towards her gas bill while checking her budget. Her water bill is $40, which she has paid half of, and her internet bill is $25, which she has made 4 payments of $5 towards. Overall, how many dollars does Stephanie still need to pay to finish paying her bills?
[Answer]Stephanie has paid three - quarters of her gas bill, which is 40 * 0.75 = $30. She then made another payment, which means she has paid 30 + 5 = $35 of her gas bill. She has paid half of her water bill, which is 40 * 0.5 = $20. She has made 4 payments towards her internet bill, which is a total of 4 * 5 = $20. Overall, her bills were 60 + 40 + 40 + 25 = $165. Overall, she has made payments of 60 + 35 + 20 + 20 = $135. Therefore, she still has to pay 165 â€“ 135 = $30. The answer is 30.
Q: An apple tree produced 200 apples in a particular season. The tree made 20% fewer fruits the following season, but the tree fruits production in the second season doubled during the third season. Calculate the total number of fruits the apple tree grew in the three seasons.
A: If the tree produced 200 apples in the first season, there were 20 / 100 * 200 = 40 fewer fruits in the second season. The total production from the apple tree in the second season is 200 - 40 = 160. In the two seasons, the apple tree produced 160 + 200 = 360 fruits. The apple tree doubled the number of fruits it produced in the third season, totaling 160 * 2 = 320. In the three seasons, the apple tree produced 320 + 360 = 680 apples. The answer is 680.
Question: Ernest bought 50 meters of wire and cut it into 5 equal parts. He then used 3 parts of the wire. How many meters of wire is not used?
Answer: Each part of the wire is 50 / 5 = 10 meters long. Ernest used 3 parts, then he used 10 x 3 = 30 meters of the wire. Therefore, 50 - 30 = 20 meters of wire is not used. The answer is 20.
[Question]If Lyn donates $240 to a private organization each year where 1/3 of it goes to the community pantry project, 1/2 goes to the local crisis fund, 1/4 of the remaining goes to livelihood project funds, and the rest is for contingency funds. How much goes to contingency fund?
[Answer]The community pantry project gets 240 x 1 / 3 = $80. The local crisis fund has 240 x 1 / 2 = $120. The total funds allocated for the two funds is $80 + $120 = $200. So, $240 - $200 = $40 are left for the other 2 funds. The livelihood project gets $40 x 1 / 4 = $10. This means that the contingency fund is $40 - $10 = $30. The answer is 30.
Q: Together, Alan and Marcy handed out 150 parking tickets. If Marcy handed out 6 fewer than 5 times as many tickets as Alan, how many tickets did Alan hand out?
A: Let a be the number of tickets Alan hands out and m be the number Marcy hands out. We know that a + m = 150 and m = 5a - 6. Substituting the second equation into the first, we get a + 5a - 6 = 150. Adding 2 to both sides, we get a + 5a = 156. Combining like terms, we get 6a = 156. Dividing both sides by 6, we get a = 26. The answer is 26.
