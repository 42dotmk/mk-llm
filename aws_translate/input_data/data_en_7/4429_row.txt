Based on the given premise, which states that there is an instructional film showing the types of stress people in the medieval ages had to deal with, it can be inferred that the hypothesis "People in the medieval ages had little stress" is not true. This inference can be further supported by examining various aspects of life in the medieval ages, including social, economic, political, and environmental factors, which contributed to creating a stressful environment for the people living at the time.

1. Social Factors:
Medieval society was highly hierarchical, with a rigid class structure. The feudal system ensured that each social stratum had its own set of responsibilities and expectations, and it was extremely difficult to move up in social status. This created stress for individuals as they constantly had to meet the expectations of their superiors while maintaining their social standing within their own class.

2. Economic Factors:
People in the medieval ages faced various economic stressors, such as famine, high taxation, and the devaluation of currencyâ€”all of which contributed to a constant struggle for survival. The majority of the population lived in poverty, working as peasants and laborers, and the restrictive nature of the feudal system made it challenging for them to improve their financial situation.

3. Political Factors:
During the medieval ages, there was a lack of centralized political authority, resulting in constant power struggles between rival factions and kingdoms. This led to numerous conflicts, including wars, invasions, and disputes over land and resources. The general population had to endure the consequences of these conflicts, such as forced conscription, destruction of property, and loss of life, which inevitably caused significant stress and fear.

4. Environmental Factors:
The medieval era experienced several environmental challenges, such as the Little Ice Age, which disrupted agricultural production and led to widespread famine. Additionally, the lack of proper sanitation and medical knowledge resulted in the spread of numerous diseases, including the infamous plague, which wiped out a significant proportion of the European population during the 14th century. The uncertainty and terror brought about by these environmental factors significantly contributed to the stress experienced by people in the medieval ages.

5. Psychological Factors:
The medieval period was characterized by a strong belief in supernatural forces, including witches, demons, and other entities thought to bring about misfortune and suffering. The constant fear of such forces, alongside superstitions, and the pervasive influence of the church, led to a heightened sense of anxiety and stress for individuals as they tried to navigate their lives while adhering to strict religious doctrines and avoiding the wrath of the supernatural realm.

In conclusion, the hypothesis "People in the medieval ages had little stress" is not supported by the evidence available. In fact, people during the medieval era had to contend with a variety of issues and challenges that were unique to their time, which contributed to a significant amount of stress and anxiety. The instructional film mentioned in the premise is likely to delve into these stressors, providing a window into the lives of people in the medieval ages and a better understanding of the challenges they faced.
