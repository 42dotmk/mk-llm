While the statement "At her behest, a reference threatening the 'undermining of native religions and customs' was replaced by a passage guaranteeing religious freedom" does offer insight into Queen Victoria's beliefs and actions, it does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question about what Victoria believed an official proclamation transferring control from the East India Company to the British monarchy would do.

To provide a more detailed response to the question, one must consider the broader context of the transfer of power from the East India Company to the British monarchy. This transfer occurred in 1858 after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, which was a widespread and violent uprising against British rule in India. Many factors contributed to the rebellion, including cultural, economic, and political grievances. After the rebellion, it was clear that the East India Company could no longer effectively govern British India, and the British government decided to take direct control of India in the form of Crown rule.

Queen Victoria believed that an official proclamation transferring control from the company to the monarchy would have several effects:

1. Strengthen British control: Taking direct control of India under the British monarchy would centralize power and provide a more stable form of governance than the East India Company could offer. This would help to prevent the disarray and mismanagement that had contributed to the rebellion.

2. Address grievances of the Indian population: Victoria felt that an official proclamation could also be used as an opportunity to address some of the grievances that the Indian population had with the company's rule. As mentioned in the statement, one of these changes was her insistence on the inclusion of a passage guaranteeing religious freedom, instead of one that threatened the undermining of native religions and customs. This would help to ease tensions in India and build trust between the British and Indian populations.

3. Promote fairness and equality: By transferring power to the British monarchy, the proclamation could help ensure that the government treated the Indian population more fairly and equitably. Victoria believed in the importance of treating all subjects of the British Empire with dignity and respect, regardless of their nationality or religion. The proclamation would embody these values and demonstrate the British government's commitment to fair governance.

4. Bolster the British Empire: The official proclamation transferring control would also serve to strengthen the British Empire as a whole. Establishing a clear and direct relationship between the Indian territories and the monarchy would provide a more coherent structure for governing and administering the empire. This would contribute to the overall stability of the empire and help protect British interests in India as well as other parts of the world.

In conclusion, Queen Victoria believed that an official proclamation transferring control from the East India Company to the British monarchy would strengthen British control in India, address the grievances of the Indian population, promote fairness and equality, and bolster the British Empire as a whole. While the specific statement about religious freedom is an important aspect of her beliefs, it is only part of a larger understanding of her perspective on the transfer of power in India.
