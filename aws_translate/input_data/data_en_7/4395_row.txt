The statement "kittens will die if they drink cold milk when they're warm" does not directly follow from the given text. It is not accurate to conclude that kittens will die from drinking cold milk when they're warm. However, it can potentially cause digestive issues and possibly harm them if they are already cold.

To elaborate further on how to feed newborn kittens commercial milk replacer, follow these detailed steps:

1. Prepare the milk replacer: Read the instructions on the commercial milk replacer package carefully and follow them to prepare the milk. This usually involves mixing the powder with warm water, and the proportions might vary according to different products.

2. Warm the milk replacer: The milk must be warmed to a suitable temperature (around 95-100째F (35-38째C)) before feeding it to the kittens, as cold milk can be harmful to them. You can use a bottle warmer or place the bottle in a bowl of warm water until the milk reaches the desired temperature. Shake the bottle gently to ensure even heat distribution.

3. Test the kitten's temperature: As mentioned earlier, make sure the kitten is not cold before feeding. If the kitten feels cold to touch, warm it up using a heating pad, warm water bottles, or by simply holding it close to your body. Keep in mind that a kitten's body temperature should be between 95-99째F (35-37째C) to ensure safe feeding.

4. Prepare the kitten for feeding: Place the kitten on its stomach on a towel or other soft surface. This will mimic the natural nursing position and help the kitten feed comfortably.

5. Use a suitable bottle and nipple: Use a bottle specifically designed for feeding kittens or a small pet nursing bottle, with a hole in the nipple that is just big enough for a steady drip when the bottle is inverted.

6. Feed the kitten: Gently insert the bottle nipple into the kitten's mouth and allow the kitten to latch on. Hold the bottle at a 45-degree angle to prevent air from entering the kitten's digestive system. Feed the kitten slowly and ensure that it is swallowing the milk.

7. Monitor the feeding amount and frequency: Newborn kittens typically need to be fed every 2-4 hours, depending on their age and size. Consult a veterinarian about the appropriate feeding schedule and amount. Maintain a feeding chart to keep track of the feedings.

8. Burp the kitten: After each feeding, gently burp the kitten by placing it against your shoulder and gently patting its back to release any trapped air in its stomach.

9. Clean the kitten: Newborn kittens require help to stimulate urination and defecation. Use a warm, wet cloth or cotton ball to gently rub the kitten's genital and anal area after each feeding.

10. Keep the kittens clean and warm: Make sure the kittens are in a clean, warm, and draft-free environment. Use a heating pad or warm water bottles to maintain a consistent temperature around the kittens.

11. Regularly visit a veterinarian: Schedule regular check-ups with a veterinarian to ensure the kittens are growing and developing properly. The veterinarian can also provide guidance for any adjustments needed in the feeding process.
