Q: In the park, the first rose bush has 12 red flowers. The second rose bush has 18 pink flowers. The third rose bush has 20 yellow flowers. The fourth rose bush has 8 orange flowers. For her vase, Lorelei picks 50% of the red roses, 50% pink roses, 25% of the yellow roses, and 25% orange roses. How many roses are in her vase?
A: The number of red roses Lorelei picks is 12 x 50% = 6 roses. The number of pink roses Lorelei picks is 18 x 50% = 9 roses. The number of yellow roses she picks is 20 x 25% = 5 roses. The number of orange roses she picks is 8 x 25% = 2 roses. The total number of roses in her vase is 6 + 9 + 5 + 2 = 22 roses. The answer is 22.
Question: Heaven and her younger brother want to buy school supplies, so they ask their father for money, who gives them $100 in total to use. Heaven buys two sharpeners and four notebooks at $5 each, and her brother uses the remaining amount to buy ten erasers at $4 each and some highlighters. How much money did Heaven's brother spend on highlighters?
Answer: Heaven spent 2 * 5 = $10 on sharpeners. She also spent 4 * 5 = $20 on notebooks. Heaven's brother used 10 * 4 = $40 to buy erasers. The total amount of money Heaven and her sister spent on sharpeners, notebooks, and erasers is 40 + 20 + 10 = $70. The total amount of money her brother spent on highlighters is 100 - 70 = $30. The answer is 30.
[Question]The cash price of a refrigerator was $8000. Samantha wanted to buy the refrigerator but pay in installments. If she paid a deposit of $3000 and paid 30 equal monthly installments of $300 each, calculate how much money she would have saved by paying cash.
[Answer]When Samantha paid $300 in 30 equal monthly installments, she paid a total of $9000. Since the higher purchase is a deposit plus the total monthly installments, Samatha paid $3000 + $9000 = $12000 for the refrigerator on higher purchase. If she would have bought the refrigerator on the cash prize, Samantha would have paid $12000 - to $8000 = $4000 less. The answer is 4000.
Q: John's grill messes up and burns half his steak. He eats 80% of what isn't burned. If the steak was originally 30 ounces how much steak did he eat?

Question: Collin learned that he could earn $0.25 per aluminum can that he brought into the recycling center. He found 12 cans at home and three times as many at his grandparents' house.  His neighbor gave him 46. His dad brought home 250 cans from the office. His dad told him he could keep the money from the cans he brought home from the office if he promised to put half of his entire amount collected into savings. How much money would Collin have to put into savings?
Answer: He found 12 and his grandparents gave him three times that amount so he got 12 * 3 = 36 cans from his grandparents. All total he collected 12 cans, the 36 from his grandparents, 46 from the neighbor and 250 from his dad for a total of 12 + 36 + 46 + 250 = 344 cans. Each can is worth $0.25 so .25 * 344 = $86.00. He agreed to put half of the $86 earned into savings so he will save 86 / 2 = $43.00. The answer is 43.
