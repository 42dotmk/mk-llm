Question: Hunter saw 5 frogs sitting on top lily pads in the pond. Three more frogs climbed out of the water onto logs floating in the pond. Then two dozen baby frogs hopped onto a big rock jutting out from the pond. How many frogs did Hunter see in the pond?
Answer: Hunter saw 5 + 3 = 8 adult frogs in the pond. He saw 2 x 12 = 24 baby frogs in the pond. Altogether, he saw 8 + 24 = 32 frogs in the pond. The answer is 32.
[Question]Paul, Amoura, and Ingrid were to go to a friend's party planned to start at 8:00 a.m. Paul arrived at 8:25. Amoura arrived 30 minutes later than Paul, and Ingrid was three times later than Amoura. How late, in minutes, was Ingrid to the party?
[Answer]If the party was planned to start at 8:00 am, Paul was 8:25 - 8:00 = 25 minutes late. If Paul was 25 minutes late, Amoura was 25 + 30 = 55 minutes late. If Ingrid was three times late than Amoura was, she was 3 * 55 = 165 minutes late. The answer is 165.
Q: A school is planning a community outreach program. Each classroom must raise $200 for this activity. Classroom A has raised $20 from each of two families, $10 from each of eight families, and $5 from each of ten families. How much more money does Classroom A need in order to reach the goal?
A: Classroom A raised 2 x $20 = $40 from two families. They raised 8 x $10 = $80 from eight families. They raised 10 x $5 = $50 from ten families. Altogether, they raised $40 + $80 + $50 = $170. Therefore, they need $200 - $170 = $30 more to reach the goal. The answer is 30.
Question: To make a yellow score mixture, Taylor has to combine white and black scores in the ratio of 7:6. If she got 78 yellow scores, what's 2/3 of the difference between the number of black and white scores she used?
Answer: The total ratio representing the yellow scores that Taylor got is 7 + 6 = 13. The difference in the ratio between the number of black and white scores Taylor used is 7 - 6 = 1. The fraction representing the difference in the ratio between the number of black and white scores Taylor used is 1 / 13, representing 1 / 13 * 78 = 6. 2 / 3 of the difference between the number of black and white scores Taylor used is 2 / 3 * 6 = 4. The answer is 4.
[Question]Bea's mom planted 50 Mahogany and 30 Narra trees on their farm. Due to a typhoon, a total of 5 trees fell. One more Mahogany tree fell than the number of Narra trees that fell. A month after the typhoon, Bea's mom planted twice as much as the number of the Narra and thrice the number of Mahogany trees that fell. How many trees are now on the farm?
[Answer]Before the typhoon, their farm had a total of 50 trees + 30 trees = 80 trees. If there was 1 more than Mahogany than Narra tree that fell, then this means there were 2 Narra trees and 2 + 1 = 3 Mahogany trees that fell during the typhoon. So, Bea's mom planted 2 trees x 2 = 4 Narra trees. She also planted 3 trees x 3 = 9 Mahogany trees. So, her mom planted 4 trees + 9 trees = 13 more trees. After the typhoon, they only had 80 trees - 5 trees = 75 trees left. Therefore, there are 75 trees + 13 trees = 88 trees now. The answer is 88.
