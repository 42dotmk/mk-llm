The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier refers to a monument dedicated to the unidentified servicemen who perished in the line of duty during wars. While there are several tombs of unknown soldiers worldwide, I shall focus on two of the most notable ones: the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the United States and the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in the United Kingdom.

1. Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, United States:

Located in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the United States was established on November 11, 1921. The idea of honoring unidentified soldiers gained momentum in the aftermath of World War I, when a profound sense of grief and recognition of the sacrifice made by so many led to calls for a national memorial. In response to these sentiments, on March 4, 1921, the U.S. Congress approved the burial of an unidentified American soldier from World War I in the plaza of Arlington National Cemetery's new Memorial Amphitheater.

An elaborate selection process was created to ensure that the chosen remains genuinely belonged to an unidentified soldier. The selected remains were transported to the United States aboard the USS Olympia, with the interment ceremony taking place on November 11, 1921, also known as Armistice Day (now observed as Veterans Day).

Over time, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier has come to represent the sacrifice of not only World War I unknowns but also unidentified soldiers from subsequent wars. Unknown soldiers from World War II and the Korean War were interred in the tomb on May 30, 1958. In 1984, the remains of an unknown soldier from the Vietnam War were also interred; however, in 1998, these remains were exhumed, identified through DNA testing as Air Force 1st Lt. Michael Joseph Blassie, and then reinterred in a cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri. Since then, the Vietnam crypt has remained empty as a symbol of those who were never identified. Since 1937, the tomb has been guarded around the clock by the tomb guards of the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment, also known as "The Old Guard."

2. Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, United Kingdom:

In the United Kingdom, the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior is located in Westminster Abbey, London. Inspired by Reverend David Railton, an army chaplain who saw a grave marked by a rough wooden cross bearing the inscription "An Unknown British Soldier," the concept gained approval, and work began on selecting the unknown warrior. Similar to the process in the United States, the British military ensured the chosen remains were genuinely unidentified. On November 7, 1920, the remains were brought to England from France and interred on November 11, 1920, inside Westminster Abbey.

The tomb has since become a revered symbol of remembrance and gratitude for the sacrifices made by all unidentified soldiers who fought in World War I and later conflicts. Since its establishment, several other Commonwealth nations have created similar monuments, making the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior a ubiquitous symbol of honor and appreciation.

In summary, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the United States was established on November 11, 1921, while the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in the United Kingdom was created slightly earlier on November 11, 1920. These monuments serve as solemn reminders of the sacrifices made by countless unidentified soldiers who fought and died for their nations during times of war.
