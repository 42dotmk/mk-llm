[Question]Rocco stores his coins in piles of 10 coins each. He has 4 piles of quarters, 6 piles of dimes, 9 piles of nickels, and 5 piles of pennies. How much money does Rocco have?
[Answer]Each pile has 10 coins, so he has:. 10 * 4 * $.25 = $10.00 worth of quarters,. 10 * 6 * $.10 = $6.00 worth of dimes,. 10 * 9 * $.05 = $4.50 worth of nickels, and. 10 * 5 * $.01 = $0.50 worth of pennies. Altogether he has $10.00 + $6.00 + $4.50 + $0.50 = $21.00. The answer is 21.
Q: Bridget counted 14 shooting stars in the night sky. Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than did Bridget, but Sam counted four more shooting stars than did Reginald. How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?
A: Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than did Bridget, or a total of 14 - 2 = 12 shooting stars. Sam counted 4 more shooting stars than did Reginald, or a total of 12 + 4 = 16 shooting stars. The average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them was (14 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 14 shooting stars. Thus, Sam counted 16 - 14 = 2 more shooting stars than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them. The answer is 2.
Question: Janice opened an art book that she had found in the library and found 5 drawings on the first page. After opening the first ten pages, she realized that the number of drawings on each page increased by five after every page. How many drawings were in the first five pages?
Answer: If the first page had 5 drawings, and the number of drawings on each page increased by five, the second page had 5 + 5 = 10. The total number of drawings in the first 2 pages is 5 + 10 = 15. On the third page, the number of drawings increased to 10 + 5 = 15. The first three pages have a total of 15 + 15 = 30 drawings. The fourth page had 15 + 5 = 20 drawings. There are 30 + 20 = 50 drawings on the first four pages. The fifth page also had an extra 5 more drawings than the fourth page, totaling 20 + 5 = 25. For the first five pages, Janice saw 25 + 50 = 75 pages. The answer is 75.
[Question]Tony goes on 5 rollercoasters while he is at the park. The first went 50 miles per hour. The second went 62 miles per hour. The third when 73 miles per hour. The fourth when 70 miles per hour. His average speed during the day was 59 miles per hour. How fast was the fifth coaster?
[Answer]The total speed of all five coasters is 295 because 59 x 5 = 295. The final coaster went 40 miles per hour because 295 - 50 - 62 - 73 - 70 = 40. The answer is 40.
Q: Charlotte, Lisa, and Patricia have a joint baseball collection. One of their friends is selling a rare baseball card for $100 on his website. Not wanting to miss such a rare opportunity, they have pooled all their money to buy the card. Patricia has $6. Lisa has five times Patricia’s money, but double Charlotte’s. How much more money do they require?
A: Since Patricia has 6 dollars, then Lisa has 6 * 5 = 30 dollars. Patricia’s money is double Charlotte’s, meaning that Charlotte has 30 / 2 = 15 dollars. Adding up all the money they have gives a total of 6 + 30 + 15 = 51 dollars. Since the rare card costs 100 dollars, the girls require an additional 100 - 51 = 49 dollars. The answer is 49.
