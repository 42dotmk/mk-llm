(i) Maria had inferior spiritual habits.

Maria had always been aware of her less-than-perfect spiritual habits. Often overwhelmed by the busy, modern world, she found it difficult to cultivate mindfulness and tranquility. Long hours at work, chaotic social life and the distractions of technology all took a toll on her mental well-being.

Seeing Maria's struggles, Mary, an old-school, wise woman with years of spiritual practice under her belt, felt compelled to help her friend. Mary had spent years learning and practicing various forms of spirituality, including meditation, yoga, and prayer. She'd seen a profound transformation in herself – she'd grown more compassionate, patient and understanding over time. She wanted the same for Maria.

Thus, Mary gently proposed the idea of mentoring Maria in her spiritual pursuits. Maria gratefully accepted, eager to cultivate a richer spiritual life. And so, Mary began to guide Maria through a well-crafted regimen of prayer and meditation.

In the initial weeks, Mary introduced Maria to different types of meditation, including mindfulness, loving-kindness and transcendental meditation. She taught Maria the art of focusing on her breath and letting go of her thoughts as they arose, allowing her mind to unwind, easing her into a deep state of relaxation.

Maria soon started noticing subtle changes – her patience was growing, and she felt a newfound peace within herself. Feeling encouraged by these moments of success, Maria and Mary moved on to exploring the power of prayer. Together, they would pray for guidance, strength, and clarity on their spiritual journey.

Mary shared stories and teachings from various spiritual traditions and explained the significance of each prayer they performed. The background they get from these stories enriched Maria's understanding and appreciation of the prayers, helping her forge a more profound, personal connection with the Divine.

As the weeks went by, Maria diligently practiced the techniques and lessons she learned from Mary. She began to implement these practices outside their sessions as well, learning to draw upon the tranquility she experienced during meditation when facing the challenges and stresses of her daily life. As a result, Maria's spiritual habits continued to grow and strengthen.

Despite the occasional slip-ups and obstacles, Maria's dedication to her spiritual practice was unwavering. Over time, her once-inferior spiritual habits gave way to a growing understanding and appreciation of mindfulness, prayer, and self-reflection.

Maria soon developed a robust and mature spiritual life. She and Mary continued to meet and share their progress with each other, bound together by their shared journey of self-discovery, growth and enlightenment.

As the years went by, Maria gradually evolved into a wise, compassionate and loving individual, radiating a sense of peace that was visible to all who met her. Friends, family and strangers alike found themselves inspired by Maria's transformation, and many began to seek her guidance just as she once sought Mary's.

Maria never forgot the kindness, patience, and wisdom Mary had shared with her, and she endeavored to pay it forward by helping others find their own path to spiritual fulfillment. Thanks to Mary's influence, Maria had turned her once-inferior spiritual habits into a powerful force for good in the world.
