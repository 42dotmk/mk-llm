Question 1 and Question 2 are not asking the same thing, as there are two distinct parts in Question 1, while question 2 focuses on only one aspect. Therefore, let me provide detailed answers to both questions separately.

Question 1: What does an IAS exactly do and what is his or her salary?

An IAS officer, or Indian Administrative Service officer, is a part of the All India Services, which is a prestigious group of civil servants that serves the Government of India as well as the individual states. IAS officers handle the administrative functions at various levels, including central, state, and district levels.

Here's an overview of the roles and responsibilities of an IAS officer:

1. Policymaking and Implementation: IAS officers play a crucial role in formulating and implementing government policies and developmental programs. They work closely with elected representatives and help in decision-making in various sectors such as education, healthcare, infrastructure, and agriculture.

2. Revenue and Law and Order Administration: At the district level, IAS officers act as District Collectors or District Magistrates. They are responsible for maintenance of law and order, revenue administration, natural resources management, and supervision of other departments and offices in their jurisdiction.

3. Public Welfare and Social Development: IAS officers are involved in designing and executing public welfare schemes and programs to uplift the standard of living of the society, particularly of underprivileged and marginalized communities.

4. Crisis and Disaster Management: In times of natural disasters and emergencies, IAS officers are responsible for coordinating relief and rescue operations, distribution of essential resources, and rehabilitation efforts to minimize the impact on public life.

Now, coming to the salary aspect, the monthly salary of an IAS officer varies according to their rank and service experience. As of 2021, the pay scale of an IAS officer starts from the Junior Time Scale and goes up to the Apex Scale. Here's an approximate breakdown:

1. Junior Time Scale (entry-level): INR 56,100 
2. Senior Time Scale (after 4 years of service): INR 67,700
3. Junior Administrative Grade (after 9 years of service): INR 78,800
4. Selection Grade (after 12-15 years of service): INR 1,18,500
5. Super Time Scale (after 17-20 years of service): INR 1,44,200
6. Above Super Time Scale (after 25-30 years of service): INR 1,82,200
7. Apex Scale (reserved for the highest-ranking IAS officers): INR 2,25,000

Apart from the basic salary, IAS officers are entitled to various allowances and perks like house rent allowance, dearness allowance, travel allowance, medical facilities, and subsidized accommodation, among others. These benefits vary depending on the posting and rank of the officer.

Question 2: What is the salary of an IAS?

As mentioned in the detailed answer to Question 1, the salary of an IAS officer varies according to their rank and years of service. The pay scale starts from the Junior Time Scale at around INR 56,100, and goes up to the Apex Scale at around INR 2,25,000 per month. The salary increases with rank progression, years of service, and promotions.

In summary, while question 1 primarily asks about the roles and responsibilities of an IAS officer and subsequently about the salary, question 2 is solely focused on the salary aspect.
