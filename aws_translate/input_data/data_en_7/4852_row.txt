After the Achean War, which took place from 146 BC to 146 BC, several significant events and repercussions occurred that reshaped the ancient world and set the stage for Rome's dominance in the Mediterranean region. The Greek heartlands (excluding the Hellenistic kingdoms in the East) were now under Roman control, marking the end of an era and the beginning of a new political landscape.

1. The fall of the Achaean League: The Achaean War led to the fall of the Achaean League, which was a confederation in ancient Greece, consisting primarily of city-states in the northern and central parts of the Peloponnese. The League aimed to maintain autonomy from the Hellenistic kingdoms and preserve Greek culture, but after its defeat in the Achean War, it was disbanded, and its territories were divided among Rome's provincial administrators.

2. The destruction of Corinth: Roman forces, under the command of Lucius Mummius Achaicus, dealt a significant blow to Greek pride by destroying the ancient city-state of Corinth in 146 BC, after they captured and plundered it. Many of its inhabitants were either killed or enslaved, and Corinth's art and treasures were shipped off to Rome. This act symbolized the subjugation of the Greek states under Roman authority.

3. Roman hegemony over Greece: With the fall of the Achaean League and the destruction of Corinth, Rome solidified its control over the Greek city-states, incorporating the territories into the newly created Roman province of Achaea. Greek states, while allowed a degree of local autonomy, were now required to submit to the authority of Roman provincial governors and contribute resources and manpower to the Roman Empire.

4. The decline of Hellenistic influences: In the wake of the Achean War, the Hellenistic era saw its influence decline, although certain facets of Greek culture, art, and philosophy persisted in the eastern Mediterranean. Many Greeks who were not under direct Roman control moved east, where they could continue to live within Hellenistic society. This eastward shift set the stage for a future confrontation between the Roman Empire and the Hellenistic kingdoms, primarily Ptolemaic Egypt and the Seleucid Empire.

5. The rise of Rome as the dominant world power: With its conquest over the Greek heartlands and the continued decline of Hellenistic powers in the east, Rome now sat as the dominant world power, with its control stretching as far as modern-day Spain to Egypt and Central Europe. The Roman Republic's government structure, military prowess, and influence continued to grow, eventually giving way to the Roman Empire under Augustus.

6. Enhanced exposure to Greek culture for Rome: The Achean War put Rome in a position to be heavily influenced by Greek culture. Many Greek texts were translated into Latin, and Roman upper classes began to adopt and emulate Greek art, philosophy, science, and architecture, integrating their Hellenized elements into Roman society.

In conclusion, the immediate aftermath of the Achean War led to the fall of the Achaean League, the destruction of Corinth, Roman hegemony over Greece, the decline of Hellenistic influence, a shift in Greek culture to the east, and the rise of Rome as the predominant world power. Furthermore, the direct exposure to Greek culture fueled Rome's fascination with Greek intellectual approach and artistic expression, which eventually integrated into the fabric of Roman society.
