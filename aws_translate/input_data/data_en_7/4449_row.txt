The Battle of Waterloo took place on June 18, 1815, about 12 miles south of Brussels, in present-day Belgium. It marked the end of the Napoleonic Wars and is considered one of the most pivotal battles in European history. The conflict involved several armies and commanders, with the principal forces being the French army under the command of Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte and the Anglo-allied army commanded by the Duke of Wellington, supported by the Prussian army led by Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher.

1. The French Army:

Napoleon Bonaparte was the Emperor of France at the time of the Battle of Waterloo. After his exile to the island of Elba in 1814, he returned to France in March 1815 and reassembled the French forces. At Waterloo, Napoleon commanded the Armée du Nord, which consisted of several corps:

- Imperial Guard: Napoleon's elite force, commanded by Marshal Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon.
- I Corps: Led by Marshal Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon, the I Corps was primarily composed of veterans from Napoleonic Wars.
- II Corps: Commanded by Marshal Honoré Charles Reille, this corps mainly consisted of infantry divisions.
- III Corps: Led by Count Louis-Nicolas Davout, Marshal of France, the III Corps bolstered Napoleon's forces with several infantry divisions.
- IV Corps: Commanded by General Henri-Gatien Bertrand, the IV Corps contained various infantry divisions.
- VI Corps: Led by Marshal Emmanuel de Grouchy, the VI Corps was composed of a mix of infantry and cavalry divisions.

2. The Anglo-Allied Army:

The Anglo-Allied Army was a coalition force primarily composed of British, Dutch, and Hanoverian soldiers and led by Arthur Wellesley, the 1st Duke of Wellington. The principal units in the Anglo-Allied Army during the Battle of Waterloo were:

- I Corps: This was the main British force and was commanded by Lieutenant General George Earl of Uxbridge.
- II Corps: Under the leadership of General Rowland Hill, this corps was composed of British, Dutch, and Hanoverian infantry and cavalry divisions.
- Netherlands Army: Also known as the Dutch-Belgian Army, this force was commanded by Prince William of Orange and played a vital role in the early stages of the battle.

3. The Prussian Army:

Led by Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, the Prussian Army played a significant part in the outcome of the battle. Arriving later in the day, their support aided the Anglo-Allied forces in defeating the French. The Prussian army was organized into various corps, commanded by different generals:

- I Corps: Commanded by General Johann David Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg, this corps consisted of infantry and cavalry divisions.
- II Corps: Under the command of General Friedrich Karl von Pirch, the II Corps was an essential force.
- III Corps: Led by General Johann Friedrich von Thielmann, this corps was instrumental in the later stages of the battle.
- IV Corps: Commanded by General Friedrich Wilhelm, Count of Bülow, this corps joined the battle later in the day and their arrival had a significant impact on the outcome.

The Battle of Waterloo marked a turning point in European history, decisively defeating Napoleon and leading to his second and final exile on the remote island of Saint Helena. Waterloo is remembered for the complex and skilled maneuvers of the commanders and the courage of the soldiers who took part in this epic battle.
