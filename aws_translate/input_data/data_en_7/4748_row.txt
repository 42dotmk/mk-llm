As Jones began to rack up yards and touchdowns, the team rallied around their newfound asset, taking a little pressure off quarterback Tony Romo and giving the Dallas receiving corps more space to maneuver. Moreover, Jones' emergence helped to balance the team's overall offensive strategy, forcing defenses to respect the Cowboys' running game.

Another significant factor contributing to Jones' success stemmed from the hard work and chemistry he cultivated with the Cowboys' offensive line. Trusting in the blockers and showing patience and vision on the field allowed Jones to seize every opportunity provided to him, further solidifying his importance when it came to the offensive game plan.
