Question: Bill is doing weight training before trying out for the boxing team. He gets two 2-gallon jugs and fills them 70% full with sand. If sand has a density of 5 pounds/gallon, how many pounds do Bill's improvised weights weigh?
Answer: First find the volume of the sand in one jug: 2 gallons * 70% = 1.4 gallons. Then double this amount since there are two jugs: 1.4 gallons * 2 = 2.8 gallons. Then multiply the total volume by the density of sand to find the total weight: 2.8 gallons * 5 pounds / gallon = 14 pounds. The answer is 14.
[Question]Emily bought 9 packs of candy necklaces to give her classmates at school for Valentine’s Day. Each pack had 8 candy necklaces in it. Emily opened one pack at a time. After her classmates took as many as they wanted, there were 40 candy necklaces left. How many packs did Emily open for her classmates?
[Answer]Emily bought 9 packs of candy necklaces * 8 candy necklaces in a pack = 72 candy necklaces. Her classmates took 72 candy necklaces – 40 candy necklaces left = 32 candy necklaces. Since each pack contained 8 necklaces, this means 32 / 8 = 4 packs of candy necklaces were opened. The answer is 4.

Question: The Great Pyramid of Giza was the tallest man-made structure on earth for almost 4000 years. It is 20 feet taller than 500 feet, and 234 feet wider than it is tall. What is the sum of the height and width of the Great Pyramid of Giza in feet?
Answer: The height is 20 feet taller than 500 feet, or 500 + 20 = 520 feet. The structure is 234 feet wider than it is tall, or a width of 520 + 234 = 754 feet wide. Therefore, the sum of the height and width of the Great Pyramid of Giza is 520 + 754 = 1274 feet. The answer is 1274.
[Question]Vermont opened up 4 web pages on his web browser and found 12 ads on the first web page and twice as many ads on the second web page as the first web page. When he opened the third web page, he found 24 more ads than the number of ads on the second web page. If the fourth web page had 3/4 times as many ads as the second web page, calculate the total number of ads Vermont clicked on if he clicked on 2/3 of them.
[Answer]If Vermont found 12 ads on the first web page and twice as many ads on the second web page as the first web page, he found 12 * 2 = 24 ads on the second web page. The first and the second web page had a total of 12 + 24 = 36. Vermont also found 24 more ads on the third web page than the second web page, a total of 24 + 24 = 48 ads. The first three web pages had 48 + 36 = 84 ads. The fourth web page had 3 / 4 times as many ads as the second web page, a total of 3 / 4 * 24 = 18 ads. In all the web pages Vermont opened, he found 84 + 18 = 102 ads. If he clicked on 2 / 3 of them, he clicked on 2 / 3 * 102 = 68 ads. The answer is 68.
