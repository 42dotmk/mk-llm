No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Let's break down each question to better understand them:

Question 1: How easy is it to submit a question on Quora?

This question aims to gather information about the process and user experience of submitting a question on Quora. It assumes that the person asking might not be familiar with the platform or is unsure about how to ask a question. The answer to this question should provide a general overview of the process as well as any tips or guidance for successfully submitting a question on the platform.

Answer: Submitting a question on Quora is relatively easy, provided you follow a few simple steps. First, create an account on Quora, or log in with your existing one. After that, you will see a "What is your question?" box at the top of the Quora homepage. Click on it and start typing the question you want to ask. As you type, Quora will suggest similar questions that have already been asked â€“ this is to help you avoid asking duplicate questions.

When you write your question, be sure to clearly and concisely phrase it to make it easy for others to understand what you're asking. Once you've composed your question, you can also add relevant topics, which will help direct it to the right audience and experts on the platform. After adding topics, simply click on "Submit," and your question will be live for others on Quora to answer.

Question 2: Why is submitting a question on Quora so difficult?

This question assumes that submitting a question on Quora is inherently difficult, and the person asking the question might have faced some challenges with the process. The answer to this question should address common issues or problems people encounter when asking questions on Quora, as well as solutions or guidance on how to make the process easier.

Answer: While many users find submitting a question on Quora simple and straightforward, there could be a few potential reasons why some people perceive the process as difficult. These could include:

1. Ambiguity in question phrasing: Quora encourages users to ask specific questions with clear context and phrasing. It might be challenging to submit a question if your question is vague, broad, or lacks context. In such cases, refine the question and provide appropriate context to help clarify what you're looking for.

2. Duplicate questions: As you type your question, Quora suggests similar questions that may have already been asked. If your question is very similar to one that has already been answered, you may be required to rephrase or reconsider your question to avoid redundancy.

3. Selecting the right topics: Finding and choosing the most relevant topics for your question can be time-consuming, as there might be multiple options within Quora's categorization system. Make sure to select the most appropriate topics for your question so that it reaches the right audience and experts for a satisfactory response.

4. Inappropriate or offensive content: Questions that contain inappropriate or offensive content, personal attacks, or violate Quora's policies could be flagged or removed from the platform, making the submission process difficult in such cases. Ensure that your question adheres to the platform's guidelines before submitting it.

By addressing these potential issues and following Quora's guidelines, the process of submitting a question should become more manageable and efficient.
