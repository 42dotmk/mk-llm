Cleaning up spilled nail polish can be challenging, but with the right tools and approach, it can be accomplished efficiently and effectively. Here's a step-by-step guideline for cleaning up a nail polish spill on different surfaces.

1. Assess the situation:
- Check the surface on which the nail polish has spilled. Different surfaces will require different cleaning methods. Common surfaces might include fabric, carpet, hardwood floors, and tiles.

2. Gather the necessary tools and materials:
Depending on the surface, the following items may be required:
- Acetone/nail polish remover (avoid using acetone on wood or fabrics that can be damaged by it)
- Cotton balls, paper towels, or clean cloth
- Microfiber cloth
- Hydrogen peroxide (for carpet and fabric surfaces)
- Rubbing alcohol (for wood surfaces)
- Baking soda
- Plastic putty knife
- Warm water
- Liquid dish soap
- Gloves (to prevent direct contact with chemicals)

3. Cleaning nail polish on different surfaces:

**Fabric:**
- Start by blotting the excess nail polish using a cloth or a paper towel. Do not rub the spill, as it may spread and push the polish deeper into the fabric.
- If the fabric is washable, soak it in cold water. Mix one teaspoon of liquid dish soap with warm water and soak the fabric for 15-20 minutes.
- Gently dab the stained area using a cloth dipped in acetone, focusing on the outer edges of the spill. Remember to test the acetone on a hidden area of the fabric to ensure it won't cause discoloration. 
- Rinse the fabric with cold water and, if the stain is still visible, repeat the acetone treatment.
- When the stain is removed, wash the fabric as per the care instructions.

**Carpet:**
- Blot excess nail polish with a clean cloth or paper towel. Make sure not to rub the spill.
- Carefully apply hydrogen peroxide to the affected area using a cotton ball, working from the perimeter of the stain towards the center.
- Blot the area again with a clean cloth or paper towel to absorb the loosened nail polish.
- Repeat the process until the stain is no longer visible.
- Rinse the area with cold water and blot dry with a clean cloth or paper towel.

**Hardwood floors:**
- Put on gloves to protect your hands from chemicals.
- Use a plastic putty knife to scrape away as much dried nail polish as possible without scratching the floor.
- Apply a small amount of rubbing alcohol to a cloth, then gently rub the stain, working from the outside edges and moving inwards. If the stain is not coming off easily, make a paste of baking soda and water and apply it to the stain, allowing it to sit for a few minutes.
- Wipe away the paste with a damp microfiber cloth and repeat the process as needed until the stain is gone.
- Dry the area thoroughly with a clean, dry cloth.

**Tiles:**
- Promptly wipe away the excess nail polish with a paper towel or cloth to prevent it from seeping into tile grout.
- Apply acetone to a cloth and gently rub the stained tile surface.
- After the nail polish is removed, clean the area with warm water mixed with a few drops of dish soap.
- Rinse with water and wipe dry with a clean cloth.

4. Final step for all surfaces:
After the nail polish is removed, ensure that the area is clean and free of any residue. Allow the surface to air-dry completely before using it again. Remember to always store nail polish in a safe and secure location to prevent future spills.
