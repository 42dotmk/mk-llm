Q: Tom bought his games for $200. They tripled in value and he then sold 40% of them. How much did he sell the games for?

Question: Bob buys 50 feet of rope. He uses a 5th of it to make a small piece of art. He takes the rest and gives half of it to the friend. After that, he cuts 2-foot sections. How many sections does he get?
Answer: He cuts off 50 / 5 = 10 feet. So he has 50 - 10 = 40 feet left. He gives half away which means he has 40 / 2 = 20 feet. So he has 20 / 2 = 10 sections. The answer is 10.
[Question]At the gym, every day, there are 300 towels laid out for guest use. Each guest is given 1 towel during their visit. The gym is open from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. In the first hour, 50 guests enter the gym. In the second hour, 20% more guests enter than during the first hour. In the third hour, 25% more guests enter than in the second hour. In the fourth hour, one third more guests enter than in the third hour. In total, how many towels do they need to wash that evening?
[Answer]In the second hour, the number of towels given out is 50 x 1.20 = 60. In the third hour, the number of towels given out is 60 x 1.25 = 75. In the fourth hour, one - third of the guests of the third hour is 75 / 3 = 25. In the fourth hour, the number of towels given out is 75 + 25 = 100. In total, including the first hour guests, they need to wash this many towels: 50 + 60 + 75 + 100 = 285. The answer is 285.
Q: John can produce 1000 tires a day. It cost $250 to produce each tire. He manages to sell them for 1.5 times as much. He could sell 1200 tires a day if his factory was able to produce more. How much money does he lose out a week by not being able to produce all the tires?
A: He sells each tire for 250 * 1.5 = $375. That means he makes a profit of 375 - 250 = $125 per tire. His production is 1200 - 1000 = 200 short. So he loses out on 125 * 200 = $25,000 a day. So he loses out on 25000 * 7 = $175,000 a week. The answer is 175000.
Question: Jo-Bob hopped into the hot air balloon, released the anchor rope, and pulled on the lift chain, which ignited the flame and provided the warm air that caused the balloon to rise. When the lift chain was pulled, the balloon would rise at a rate of 50 feet per minute. But when the chain was not being pulled, the balloon would slowly descend at a rate of 10 feet per minute. During his balloon ride, he pulled the chain for 15 minutes, then released the rope for 10 minutes, then pulled the chain for another 15 minutes, and finally released the chain and allowed the balloon to slowly descend back to the earth. During his balloon ride, what was the highest elevation reached by the balloon?
Answer: The first 15 - minute chain pull caused the balloon to rise 50 * 15 = 750 feet. Releasing the chain for 10 minutes caused the balloon to descend 10 * 10 = 100 feet. The second 15 - minute chain pull caused the balloon to rise another 50 * 15 = 750 feet. Thus, at the end of the second chain pull, when the balloon was at its highest elevation, the balloon had risen to an elevation of 750 - 100 + 750 = 1400 feet above the earth's surface. The answer is 1400.
