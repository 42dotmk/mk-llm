Question 1: If I have a B2 multiple visa and exit to The Bahamas and then return to the USA, will my length of visit be renewed to another 6 months?

Answer 1: The B2 visa is a type of U.S. non-immigrant visa meant for tourism, visiting family/friends, or medical treatment. This visa generally has a validity of up to 10 years and allows multiple entries. However, the validity of the visa is not the same as the maximum duration of your stay. The maximum duration of your stay in the U.S. during a single visit depends on the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the port of entry, who usually grants an authorized period of stay for up to 6 months.

When you travel to a nearby country, such as The Bahamas, and return to the USA, the U.S. CBP officer will decide on the duration of your authorized stay by considering various factors. This includes the purpose of your trip, your previous visits, and ensuring compliance with the rules and conditions of your B2 visa. There is no guarantee that your length of stay will be automatically renewed to another 6 months. It is up to the CBP officer's discretion to decide the length of your new authorized stay.

It is crucial to understand that frequent and extended stays in the U.S. may raise suspicion and lead to denial of entry. Therefore, it is always advisable to maintain a reasonable gap between visits in order to avoid any issues at the U.S port of entry.

Question 2: Visas (entry/exit permits): Can I travel to the USA (Tourism B2 visa) from India using the B2 visa issued in the UK (London US embassy)?

Answer 2: Yes, you can travel to the USA using a valid B2 visa issued by any U.S embassy or consulate, regardless of the country in which you applied for it. The B2 tourist visa, in this case issued by the London U.S. embassy, is a non-immigrant visa that allows entry to the United States for tourism or medical treatment purposes. The important requirement is that your B2 visa should still be valid at the time you travel.

If you hold a valid B2 visa issued in the UK and are currently in India, you can use your visa to travel to the United States. However, note that entry to the U.S. is not guaranteed and remains at the discretion of the U.S. CBP officer at the port of entry. They will consider factors such as the purpose of your visit, your travel history, and your overall immigration and entry risk profile. A valid B2 visa granted by a U.S. embassy or consulate allows you the opportunity to request entry to the United States but does not guarantee that entry will be permitted.

Comparison of answers:

The answers to the two questions are not the same, as both questions address different aspects of B2 visa usage and entry regulations.

- Answer 1 focuses on the renewal of the authorized stay period upon reentry to the U.S. after a trip to a nearby country (The Bahamas) while holding a valid B2 visa with multiple entries. The answer emphasizes that the duration of the authorized stay will depend on the discretion of the CBP officer.
  
- Answer 2 addresses the eligibility of traveling to the USA from India using a B2 visa issued in the UK. The answer confirms that it is possible to use a B2 visa issued in any country, as long as the visa is valid at the time of travel. The answer also emphasizes that the entry to the U.S. is not guaranteed and depends on the CBP officer's judgment at the port of entry.
