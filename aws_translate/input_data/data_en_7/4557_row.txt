Of the given options, the best evidence to disprove the claim that a bird species considered extinct since the 1900s is still present would be (III) A researcher takes a photograph of the bird.

Here's a detailed analysis of each option:

(I) A bird watcher makes a sketch of the bird: While a bird watcher's sketch may provide some evidence that the bird might still exist, this is not a particularly strong or reliable form of evidence. Sketches can be influenced by personal interpretations and may not accurately represent the bird in question. Moreover, sketches cannot be verified through additional sources or technological means as photographs or video recordings can. Consequently, while intriguing, a sketch would likely not hold up as strong evidence to disprove the bird's extinction.

(II) A scientist discovers fossil remains of the bird: Fossils can provide valuable information about the history of a species, including its distribution, morphology, and environmental context. Fossils can also help scientists understand the evolutionary relationships between different species. However, discovering fossil remains of the bird would not disprove its extinction claim, since fossils are remnants from the past rather than current evidence of a living population. Instead, finding fossil remains would serve to validate the existence of the species but would not confirm the presence of living individuals in modern times.

(III) A researcher takes a photograph of the bird: A photograph, taken by a researcher and supplemented by other supporting documents such as GPS coordinates and date-stamped metadata, would provide the most compelling evidence that the bird species still exists. A clear, unambiguous photograph, validated by experts in the field, could be considered definitive proof that the bird is not extinct. A photograph can capture specific morphological features that are critical for identification and can be more easily scrutinized and verified by specialists in ornithology to establish the presence of the bird. Moreover, photographs provide a relatively standardized and unambiguous form of visual documentation that can be shared and analyzed among different experts and institutions.

(IV) A park ranger finds a suitable habitat for the bird: The existence of suitable habitat for a particular bird species is an essential factor for its survival. While it is positive news that a park ranger finds such a habitat, this alone does not provide direct evidence that the bird still exists. In fact, the bird's extinction, while still having its ideal habitat, could be due to other factors such as disease, predation, or human-induced habitat destruction in other areas. The presence of a suitable habitat may suggest the potential for reintroducing a bird species through conservation and restoration efforts. However, without any direct sighting or recorded evidence of the bird, the claim of its extinction cannot be effectively disproven.

In conclusion, the strongest evidence to disprove the claim that a bird species considered extinct since the 1900s is still alive would be a clear, unequivocal photograph of the bird taken by a researcher, accompanied by additional documentation to support the sighting's credibility. This would provide a reliable, verifiable basis for asserting that the bird is still present in modern times and can refute the earlier claim of its extinction.
