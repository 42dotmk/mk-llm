left."

Elisabeth hesitated, glancing back towards the faceless throng where the boys disappeared. Her eyebrows arched with concern, but David gently squeezed her hand, a reassuring smile curving upon his face.

"Come, Lizzie. The lads are resourceful. They'll find us when they tire." He whispered to her before turning his attention back onto the lively square. Around him, jovial merriment buzzed like the frenzied dance pattern of bees. The vibrant strings of lanterns, draped carelessly between rustic buildings, painted a joyful picture as they swayed with the rhythm of the soft evening wind. Laughter echoed, creating a symphony with the musicians whose melodies captivated every heart within hearing distance.

Seeing her apprehension wane, he led Elisabeth towards the musicians, their tunes a harmonious amalgamation of the fiddle, the harp and the bagpipe. The rhythm was infectious, and soon enough even the most reluctant toes itched to join in the dance.

David's heart warmed as he led Elisabeth gently into the dance. As a seasoned sailor, his footing was sure, and Elisabeth seemed to glide by his side. Her long, flaxen hair twirled and spun in the orbit defined by their dance, a moon revolving around an invisible planet. The darkness of her eyes sparkled with laughter and joy, a sight he had been longing for in the relentless hustle and bustle of their daily lives.

As he steered them into the heart of the celebration, swinging Elisabeth around in time with the raucous tempo of the fiddle, he couldn't help but get lost in the tranquility of the moment. Allowing the exuberance of their simple lives to bubble up inside him until it reflected in his laughter, reflecting back at Elisabeth's equally radiant smile. Their thoughts centered around the rhythm, forgetting the troubles of the day, if only for a while.

Time danced away as the couple lost themselves in the rhythm of the music; the concerns of the day fading into nothingness. The boys' naughtiness almost seemed endearing under the spell of the evening. The level of detail each tune possessed, the way Elisabeth twirled in David's arms, her hand fitting perfectly into his, it truly was a bit of the evening they had left to explore and cherish. 

Under the canopy of twilight, amidst the crescendo of the evening's enchanting music, their laughter merged into harmonious symphony; a testament of the happiness found in simplicity, a rare moment of respite from their mundane routines.

As the last notes of the melody floated into the nighttime air, a loud cheer went up from the villagers in unison, clapping their hands and stamping their feet in a jovial celebration of life. David, holding Elisabeth's waist gently, looked down into her sparkling eyes, a soft tug of happiness pricking the corners of his own.

"See? We've a bit of evening left, Lisbeth." He said, gesturing towards their boys, who were now running towards them, breathless and flushed, but with unmistakable happiness plastered on their faces.

A chapter of their lives concluded with the winding down of the village music, one they'd fondly remember as the night they danced under the stars; surrounded by music, caught in laughter, and enveloped in love. And as the boys reached them, panting and throwing their exhausted selves into the adults' open arms, it was a stamp of agreement on David's words. They indeed had the whole evening left.
