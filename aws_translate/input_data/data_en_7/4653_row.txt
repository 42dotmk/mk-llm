Title: "Indian Television Journalist Sacked for Unprofessional Conduct Amidst Deadly Floods"

A wave of controversy has crashed upon the world of Indian journalism, resulting in the dismissal of an erstwhile popular television reporter. This event followed a public outcry after the journalist reported on the devastating floods in the region while perched on the shoulders of a flood survivor. According to the news channel, this inappropriate conduct and lack of sensitivity led to his termination.

To provide context, the incident came to light when the reporter's news segment covering the disastrous floods in the country aired. In the midst of the devastation, the reporter chose an unusual vantage point for his report, namely, the shoulders of a victim of the floods. This glaring unprofessionalism sparked widespread criticism from the public and media fraternity alike, leading to the necessary punitive action imposed by the channel.

The decision to terminate the journalist was justified by the channel as a response to his insensitive and irresponsible actions, which showcased a stark absence of empathy towards the disaster victims. At a time when humanity grapples with nature's wrath, it is the duty of every reporter to cover the situation professionally and ethically. It is press ethics to ensure that the dignity and respect of disaster victims are held high, which the sacked reporter seemingly overlooked.

In his defense, the journalist claimed to be providing viewers a clear picture of the deluge's severity. However, his argument was overshadowed due to his lack of professional conduct. It became a question not only of professional guidelines but also moral values. The journalist's modus operandi raised serious questions about his empathy towards the victims, teetering on the edge of objectifying the victim for the sake of news.

This incident brings to light the need for ethical journalism. Reporters must endeavor to deliver accurate and vital information, without losing sight of their social responsibilities. The individuals who bear the brunt of unforeseen tragedies like floods require empathy and understanding, not to be used as mere columns for aiding news reports. 

The channel's decision to sack the reporter signifies the gravity of professional and ethical violations. Ethics and professionalism must be the guiding principles of journalism and this incident serves as a stern reminder of it. This sacking emphasizes the industry's commitment to uphold these standards, as well as the penalties that ensue for those who cross these boundaries.

In conclusion, the path of journalism is paved with responsibility and respect towards every individual's story. Reporters must remember to conduct their tasks without losing sight of their empathy for the subjects they deal with. The ethical lapse of the sacked journalist serves as a call to all journalists. It stands as a stark reminder of the importance of treating all individuals with respect and dignity, particularly in times of disaster when humanity should stand united.

End Note: The unfortunate incident serves as a compelling lesson for all in the realm of journalism. Balance between the audacity of investigative journalism and sensitivity towards subjects, often victims, is quintessential. Journalism should always stand close to its moral compass, delivering the truth without compromising the dignity of its subjects.
