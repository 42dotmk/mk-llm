To cook pasta, follow these detailed steps to ensure you achieve perfectly cooked, delicious results every time:

1. Choose the right pasta: Select the type and shape of pasta that is suitable for the recipe you have in mind. There are several types of pasta, such as spaghetti, linguine, fettuccine, penne, fusilli, farfalle, and many more. Each type of pasta varies in shape and size, which impacts its cooking time and how it will hold the sauce.

2. Measure the pasta: Measure the appropriate amount of pasta you need for your dish. A general guideline is about 2 ounces (56 grams) of dried pasta per person for a main course and 1 ounce (28 grams) for a side dish or appetizer.

3. Fill a large pot with water: Fill a large pot with plenty of cold water (around 4 to 6 quarts per pound of pasta) to ensure the pasta has enough room to cook without sticking together. 

4. Add salt: Heavily season the water with kosher salt or sea salt (not table salt). The recommended amount is 1 to 2 tablespoons of salt per pound of pasta. The salt will flavor the pasta and help the sauce adhere better.

5. Bring the water to a boil: Place the pot on high heat and bring the water to a rolling boil. A rolling boil is characterized by large bubbles that only get larger, even after stirring the water.

6. Add the pasta: Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the measured pasta gradually to the boiling water. Stir gently with a wooden spoon or a pasta fork to prevent the pasta from sticking together or to the bottom of the pot.

7. Set the cooking time: Check the pasta package for recommended cooking times, and set a timer accordingly. Cooking times can vary based on the type and thickness of the pasta. Note that fresh pasta cooks much faster than dried pasta, typically in just 2 to 4 minutes.

8. Stir occasionally: As the pasta cooks, gently stir it every couple of minutes to prevent sticking. This is especially important during the first few minutes when the pasta is softening and adjusting to the boiling water.

9. Test for doneness: About 2 minutes before the recommended cooking time, start checking the pasta for doneness. Take a piece out using a slotted spoon or a fork, allow it to cool for a few seconds, and then taste it. The pasta should be cooked al dente - tender but with a slight bite in the middle. Be careful not to overcook, as overcooked pasta becomes mushy.

10. Reserve pasta water: Before draining the pasta, reserve at least a cup of the pasta cooking water. This starchy water can be used to adjust the consistency of your sauce, as well as help the sauce better adhere to the pasta.

11. Drain the pasta: Remove the pot from the heat and carefully pour the pasta into a colander placed in the sink. Give the colander a gentle shake to remove excess water, but avoid rinsing the pasta unless you are making a cold pasta salad.

12. Combine with sauce: Immediately transfer the drained pasta back to the pot or to a pan with your prepared sauce. Toss the pasta and sauce gently to coat the pasta evenly. If needed, add some reserved pasta water to adjust the consistency.

13. Serve and enjoy: Plate the pasta and sauce, garnish according to your recipe preferences (such as with grated cheese or chopped herbs), and serve immediately. Pasta tastes best when served hot and fresh.

Follow these steps, and you will successfully cook pasta that is flavorful and satisfying for any meal or occasion.
