Title: The Consequences of a Classroom Film Unwatched: Ohio Substitute Teacher Faces Jail Time

In the rich tapestry of teaching, a key tip for teachers has come to the fore following a critical incident in Columbus' East High School in Ohio. The critical piece of advice - always screen a film before you show it to your students. A lesson most unfortunately learned by Sheila Kearns, a substitute teacher, who was sentenced to three years of probation and 90 days in jail for failing to abide by it. 

Residing in a school culture that not only treasures education but also the well-being of students, the episode serves as a stark reminder of the significant responsibility placed upon educators. What a teacher decides to bring into the classroom environment affects the learning trajectory of students, as Kearns discovered to her dismay. She was asked to fill-in for a Spanish teacher in April 2013, an incident that ended up having dire consequences both for her and the five classes of students exposed to the unrated movie, 'The ABCs of Death.'

Two months after the incident, Kearns' teaching journey took a turn for the worse. She was fired after the school discovered the nature of the movie shown to students aged 14 to 18 years old. The graphic movie encompassed a myriad of hard-hitting scenes involving grisly deaths, full-frontal nudity, and positions of sexual intimacy. It was a stark contrast from what would normally be expected in a classroom setting. The class viewing ended up more aligned with chapters titled "E is for Exterminate" and "O is for Orgasm," rather than a day of learning Spanish.

Kearns, who was also handed a conviction of four counts of disseminating matter harmful to juveniles, did express remorse over her actions. However, as a key argument in her defense, Kearns claimed that she was not aware of the movie content, explaining she hadn't watched the material beforehand and had her back to the screen throughout the day. 

However, her claims were met with skepticism. A student contradicted Kearns' assertion, testifying that the substitute teacher had indeed watched the movie. This testimony seemingly tipped the scales in favor of Judge Charles A. Schneider's derogatory conclusion. Refuting Kearns' claim, Judge Schneider mentioned, "There's no way you'll persuade me that's what happened." He also highlighted the imprudence of the Columbus public schools, criticizing the decision to assign a teacher to a class she wasn't equipped to teach.

This incident has led to Kearns staring down the barrel of her sentence. However, the start of her sentence, scheduled for April 10, will be delayed due to an appeal launched by Kearns' attorney against her conviction.

The incident not only raises a red-flag on Kearns' actions but also points rankled fingers at the flaws prevalent in the education system. While it underlines the critical requirement for educators to fully comprehend and vet the content they bring in their classrooms, it also amplifies the fact that the task of placing a teacher in a role should be done judiciously by the schools. 

As the story of Kearns unravels, it stands as a grim reminder of the power wielded by educators, and the severe consequences that can unfold when not used judiciously. It underscores a fundamental lesson - watching and understanding a movie's content before showing it in class is not merely a precaution, but a necessity.
