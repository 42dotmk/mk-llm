A (abbreviated ) is a word-formation device used to express such meanings; in many languages, such forms can be translated as "little" and diminutives can also be formed as multi-word constructions such as "Tiny Tim". Diminutives are used frequently when speaking to small children or when expressing extreme tenderness and intimacy to an adult. As such, they are often employed for nicknames and pet names. The opposite of the diminutive form is the augmentative.  - The Penguin Group is a trade book publisher, part of Penguin Random House.

The company was founded by Samuel Pearson in 1844 as a building and engineering concern operating in Yorkshire under the name "S. Pearson & Son". In 1880, control passed to his grandson Weetman Dickinson Pearson, an engineer, who in 1890 moved the business to London and turned it into one of the world's largest construction companies. Another of its prominent engineers was Ernest William Moir who, after working for Pearson on tunnels in New York City, became the contractor's agent on construction of the Blackwall Tunnel under the River Thames in London between 1892 and 1897. The company also built the Admiralty Harbour at Dover, the Halifax Dry Dock in Canada, the East River Railway Tunnels in New York City, the Mexican Grand Canal that drained Mexico City, the Tehuantepec Railway in Mexico, and railways and harbours around the world. In November 1915, the firm began construction of HM Factory, Gretna, the largest cordite factory in the UK during World War I.  - A joint venture (JV) is a business entity created by two or more parties, generally characterized by shared ownership, shared returns and risks, and shared governance. Most joint ventures are incorporated, although some, as in the oil and gas industry, are "unincorporated" joint ventures that mimic a corporate entity. Key elements of a joint venture's design include: 1) the number of parties; 2) the geographic, product, technology and value-chain scope within which the JV will operate; 3) the contributions of the parties; 4) the structural form (each country has specific options, e.g. in the U.S. the main options are a C Corporation or an LLC/partnership structure); 5) the valuation of initial contributions and ownership split among the parties; 6) the economic arrangements, post-deal (e.g. Is the joint venture intended to general profits vs. operate as a cost-sharing or production-sharing venture; if a for-profit entity, will the parties share profits in proportion to equity ownership, or some other way?); 7) governance and control; 8) Talent/HR model (will the Jv have its own staff on own payroll vs. second staff from the parent companies; 9) contractual arrangements with the parent companies for inputs, outputs or services; 10) exit and evolution provisions?  - Bertelsmann is a German multinational corporation based in GÃ¼tersloh, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

This contrasts deeply with a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of meaning but will not necessarily stand on its own. A word may consist of a single morpheme (for example: "oh!, rock, red, quick, run, expect"), or several ("rocks, redness, quickly, running, unexpected"), whereas a morpheme may not be able to stand on its own as a word (in the words just mentioned, these are "-s, -ness, -ly, -ing, un-, -ed"). A complex word will typically include a root and one or more affixes ("rock-s, red-ness, quick-ly, run-ning, un-expect-ed"), or more than one root in a compound ("black-board, rat-race"). Words can be put together to build larger elements of language, such as phrases ("a red rock"), clauses ("I threw a rock"), and sentences ("He threw a rock too, but he missed").  - Hamish Hamilton Limited was a British book publishing house , founded in 1931 eponymously by the half - Scot half - American Jamie Hamilton ( Hamish is the vocative form of the Gaelic ' Seamus ' ( meaning James ) , James the English form -- which was also his given name , and Jamie the diminutive form ) .
