 WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. – Eclipse fever has officially taken over. 
  
 Just days after releasing the delicious Reese's Peanut Butter Cups doughnut to the masses, Krispy Kreme is bumping it up a notch. 
  
 For the first time ever, Krispy Kreme’s original glazed doughnuts will be “eclipsed” by chocolate glaze to commemorate the total solar eclipse.
