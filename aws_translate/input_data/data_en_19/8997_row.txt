The National Rifle Association refused to answer questions at what it had claimed was a "press conference" today in response to the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. 
  
 Instead, NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre gave a speech calling for armed police officers at all schools and blaming violent video games for mass shootings, rather than the ability of those shooters to obtain a firearm. 
  
 Notably, an armed police officer was present at Columbine High School at the time of the mass shooting there. After attempting to fire on one of the shooters with his pistol, he was quickly pinned down by the greater firepower of the shooter's assault weapon. 
  
 The Washington Post has noted that data show no correlation between video game spending per capita and gun-related homicides. But the NRA's reaction is consistent with that of Fox News. 
  
 This puts special pressure on the hosts of NBC's Meet The Press and CBS' Face The Nation, who will host LaPierre and NRA president David Keene on Sunday, to ask the questions that the rest of the press corps was unable to. 
  
 Any such interview should address the conspiratorial language that LaPierre typically uses in speaking to his base, notably his claim that President Obama plans to use his second term to "erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights." ||||| Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association will forever now be known as America’s maddest gunman. 
  
 In style and substance, his performance Friday in delivering his organization’s response to the Newtown massacre revealed the obsessive, lunatic paranoia behind its worship of firearms. 
  
 A week after a gunman armed with an assault rifle murdered 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, and ever so shortly after the bells there tolled for the dead, LaPierre lashed out at everyone and everything but the weapons that were used to kill. 
  
 Still worse, in his arrogance and in his sense that terrible forces are out to get him, LaPierre was callous to the raw agony of the families of the slain. The hell with them — he made clear that he will fight to maintain the easy availability of assault weaponry of the kind that killed their kids. 
  
 He flayed the news media for supposedly perpetuating a culture of violence and ignorance. 
  
 He blamed video games and movies for murder, as if big-screen or small-screen entertainment matters more than easily obtained machines of death.

 He mocked anyone with a single new idea to prevent deadly weapons from falling into the hands of those intent on mayhem. 
  
 And, exhibiting a level of insanity that qualifies people for commitment as a danger to themselves or others, he called for stationing armed cops at every school in the United States. 
  
 You see, in Wacko Wayne’s world, the only answer to death by guns is to flood the country with more guns and stand ready for the shootouts. His zeal is worse than nuts; it’s a peril to life and limb. 
  
 All this springs from LaPierre’s dark vision of America as a country where psychopaths roam free and plot even now to kill. 
  
 NRA'S TOP GUN LOBBYIST WAYNE LAPIERRE IS THE SECOND AMENDMENT'S MAN WITH A GOLDEN TONGUE 
  
 Here he was in full flight: “The truth is that our society is populated by an unknown number of genuine monsters — people so deranged, so evil, so possessed by voices and driven by demons that no sane person can possibly ever comprehend them. They walk among us every day. And does anybody really believe that the next Adam Lanza isn’t planning his attack on a school he’s already identified at this very moment? 
  
 “How many more copycats are waiting in the wings for their moment of fame — from a national media machine that rewards them with the wall-to-wall attention and sense of identity that they crave — while provoking others to try to make their mark?�? 
  
 By the time LaPierre insisted on a national database of the mentally ill, one could be forgiven for wondering whether it should include the paranoid, delusional man himself, because his description of people “so possessed by voices and driven by demons that no sane person can possibly ever comprehend them�? surely fits the hard core of the NRA. 
  
 No one can argue against school security. New York City has plenty, mostly with unarmed security officers. But staffing every school building in the country is wildly unnecessary and would be prohibitively expensive while achieving little. 
  
 Remember: There was an armed guard at Columbine High School, scene of the 1999 murders of 12 students and one teacher. The two teenagers who went on the bloody rampage feared him not, nor was he in a position to save the victims. 
  
 Remember, too: Mass killings have become more frequent in America as guns have become more commonplace. If you can’t prove that the increasing availability of assault weapons caused the killings, it is absolutely clear that having guns all over did not deter the slaughter. 
  
 There’s an upside to LaPierre’s act. In showing his extremism, he shot himself in the foot, if not somewhere more damaging. His most fervent supporters will be pleased, but many NRA members — the large number who are more reasonable — will likely be appalled. Will his allies in Congress step up with the billions of dollars that would be needed every year to staff schools with cops? No way. 
  
 New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, got to the heart of the matter, accusing LaPierre of taking “the easy way out.�? He said: 
  
 “Listen, I don’t necessarily think having an armed guard outside every classroom is conducive to a positive learning environmen. But let me just say in general I don’t think that the solution to safety in schools is putting [in an] armed guard — because for it to be really effective, in my view, from a law enforcement perspective, you’d have to have an armed guard outside every classroom.�? 
  
 For all that advocates of sensible gun-safety measures have said in the past seven days, nothing did more to discredit the merchants of weapons of death than their own chief advocate’s callous rant. 
  
 How many will follow America’s mad gunman over the cliff? 
  
  
  
  ||||| According to the National Center for Education Statistics there are 98,817 K-12 schools in the United States . The Bureau of Labor Statistics says cops make $55,000 a year . So we could put $5.4 billion as the low level estimate of the cost. Cops obviously have health care benefits and pension and disability benefits for police offers tend to be fairly costly so the real price would be higher than that. 
  
 At any rate, on both the policing side and the gun control side it would be a mistake to focus too much on spectacular school massacres. What happened at Sandy Hook was terrible, but at least 78 people have been shot and killed in America since then. If you want to regulate guns more strictly, the smart play is to focus on the portable concealable handguns that are widely used in those "ordinary" crimes and if you want to spend billions on hiring new police officers the smart play to focus on deploying them in the high-crime neighborhoods where most of the murdering happens. Obviously one would hope that a less-armed, lower-crime society would also feature fewer monstrous massacres as a side benefit but concentrating our policing resources on static defense of K-12 schools would be foolish. 
  
  ||||| The National Rifle Association called for armed guards in every school as a reaction to last week's massacre in Newtown, Conn., prompting an immediate backlash from social media users on Friday. 
  
 During and after the press conference where the plan was unveiled, NRA-related hashtags dominated Twitter trends across the United States.

 Reporter and Twitter user George Zornick pointed out that Columbine, the site of a 1999 school massacre, had armed guards:

 Some users did agree with some or all of what the NRA had to say:

 I only agree with 1% of the NRA's dogma but as a former school resource officer I agree that we need one in every single school. — Yes, Another Tweet (@yesanothertweet) December 21, 2012 
  
 The NRA also in part blamed video games and other violent media for the Newtown shooting, an argument many Twitter users rejected and made fun of. "Mortal Kombat," one of the games singled out during the conference, was a trending topic during the conference.

 The NRA, meanwhile, set up a new website for its the campaign, dubbed "The National School Shield."

Richards/AFP/Getty Images ||||| The National Rifle Association gave their first press conference following the Newtown massacre on Friday, during which Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre offered a number of solutions to prevent mass shootings, such as having armed guards in every school, as well as criticisms ranging from the culture of violence-as-entertainment and the media’s demonization of guns in general (transcript here): 
  
 As brave and heroic and as self-sacrificing as those teachers were in those classrooms and as prompt and professional and well- trained as those police were when they responded, they were unable — through no fault of their own, unable to stop it. As parents we do everything we can to keep our children safe. It’s now time for us to assume responsibility for our schools. The only way — the only way to stop a monster from killing our kids is to be personally involved and invested in a plan of absolute protection. The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. … I call on Congress today, to act immediately to appropriate whatever is necessary to put armed police officers in every single school in this nation. And, to do it now to make sure that blanket safety is in place when our kids return to school in January. … Every school is gonna have a different solution based on its own unique situation. Every school in America needs to immediately identify, dedicate and deploy the resources necessary to put these security forces in place, though, right now. And the National Rifle Association, as America’s preeminent trainer of law enforcement and security personnel for the past 50 years — we have 11,000 police training instructors in the NRA — is ready, willing and uniquely qualified to help. … If we truly cherish our kids, more than our money, more than our celebrities, more than our sports stadiums, we must give them the greatest level of protection possible. And that security is only available with properly trained, armed good guys. Under Asa’s leadership, our team of security experts will make this program available to the world for protecting our children in school. And we’ll make the program available to every single school in America, free of charge. That’s a plan of action that can, and will make a real positive, indisputable difference in the safety of our children, and it will start right now. 
  
 I don’t know about having an armed public servant stationed in every school; that is an assuredly expensive endeavor that is better left to federalism, although the NRA was likely going for some popular appeal with that suggestion and a few others. But, I am completely on board with the sentiment that this immediate reaction against all types of guns is ridiculous, and the very idea of merely declaring schools to be “gun-free zones” as the best method of protecting our children is utter folly (full blogger’s disclosure: I am an NRA member). Whether it’s with “assault” weapons or semiautomatics or what have you, a determined murderer is rarely-to-never going to be stopped by people who are themselves unarmed. We can do better than merely calling for more demonstrably failed gun-control measures as the only way of enhancing public safety and security, and every other pro-gun idea is categorically and irrevocably declared out of the question. 
  
 Of course, there was probably nothing the NRA could say that was ever going to play over well with the media and progressives regardless of the content — and predictably, nothing really did (although, funnily enough, LaPierre talked up some of the ideas that Congressional Democrats have already proposed in Newtown’s wake without a major media backlash… hmmm…). ||||| Tweet with a location
