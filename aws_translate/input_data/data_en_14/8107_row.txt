49ers’ preseason takeaway: What a difference in Davis

Mike Davis had no nowhere to go but up after his rookie season, but who expected the 49ers running back to reach such heights Sunday?

Yes, it was a preseason game, but the slimmed-down, cutting-on-a-dime Davis looked far shiftier than the first-year version. In 2015, Davis (35 carries, 58 yards) became the sixth running back since 1970 to average less than 2.0 yards a carry with at least 35 attempts in a season (the anonymous others: Louis Carter, Reggie Rivers, Lamar Gordon, Odell Lawson and Willie Spencer).

On Sunday, in a 24-13 loss to the Texans, Davis rushed for 71 yards on five carries, ripping off gains of 44 and 17 yards.

Chip Kelly was asked if Davis, a fourth-round pick, looked different than the player he’d seen on video in 2015.

Kelly began with a joke (“Yeah, he’s a lot bigger in person”), before acknowledging Davis boosted his chances of making the 53-man roster.

“I knew that he ran behind his pads really well and he’s shown that,” Kelly said. “He’s really put himself in a position for a spot … Some guys really stepped up and really took advantage of that opportunity and some other guys were kind of looking around and kind of caught up in the moment.”

Davis stepped up because he stepped with more burst than he showed in 2015. Davis, listed at 5-foot-9, 217 pounds, isn’t a burner (4.58-second 40), but on Sunday he wasn’t the plodder he resembled as a rookie.

2-8-SF43 (shotgun): Davis right guard pushed ob at HST 13 for 44 yards.

Davis, lined up to the right of QB Thad Lewis, began with a counter move that put him in the middle of the backfield. He then bounced back to the right and ran through a sizable hole created by a seal block from TE Blake Bell and pancake block from RT Trent Brown. Five yards beyond the line of scrimmage, Davis hopped over the would-be shoestring tackles of two defenders and raced down the right sideline.

2-10-HOU 13 (shotgun): Davis left tackle to HST 6 for 7 yards

Davis, lined up the right of Lewis, ran left as he took the handoff and drifted parallel to the line of scrimmage, before cutting hard off his left foot and running decisively downfield.

2-10-HOU 46 (shotgun): Davis right end to HST 43 for 3 yards

David, lined up to the right of Lewis, drifted left before cutting hard right. It initially appeared the cutback would net a decent gain, but Lewis got in his way as he carried out a zone-read fake. Lewis appeared to offer a Davis a my-bad tap on the helmet after the play.

2-5-SF 25 (shotgun): M.Davis left tackle to SF 42 for 17 yards

Davis, lined up to the left of Lewis, drifted to the middle of the backfield before cutting hard off his right foot. He avoided a would-be tackler at his feet in the backfield and sprinted into the open field. Said play-by-play man Bob Fitzgerald after the run: “Did Mike Davis just get faster in the offseason?”

2-10-SF 42 (shotgun): Davis right end to SF 43 for 1 yard

Davis, lined up the right of Lewis, cut right and probably would have gained about five yards if he squared his shoulders and ran upfield. Instead, he tried to juke a defender, bounced outside and ran four yards in the wrong direction before he was dragged down by a host of defenders. He’s faster than he was last year, but he’s not fast enough to turn the corner on a run like that.

Write a title for it.
