The two questions you've presented are distinct from one another, addressing two separate topics. Let me provide detailed and long answers for both of them:

1. Is the test taker report for GMAT accessible immediately after the test? Itâ€™s not the official score report that GMAC sends after 15-20 days.

The GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Test) is a computer adaptive test taken by prospective MBA and business school candidates to gauge their analytical, writing, and mathematical skills. Administered by the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC), the GMAT score plays a significant role in business school admissions.

On finishing the GMAT, candidates can view their unofficial scores instantly. The moment the test ends, an on-screen message explains the reporting procedure and offers a choice to accept or cancel the scores. If the candidate accepts the scores, the unofficial test taker report, which includes the Verbal, Quantitative, and Integrated Reasoning scores, is readily available. The total score, without the Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA) score, appears. However, this is only an informal report and isn't the complete official score report.

The official score report, which incorporates the AWA score, is available within the mentioned 15-20 days following the exam. GMAC sends this report to the candidate's chosen business schools. Moreover, the applicant receives an email containing instructions to access the online official scores.

2. India available in types of chees?

This question seems to be about the types of cheese available in India. India has a diverse food culture with numerous regional cuisines and a variety of dairy dishes. Although the popularity of cheese is not as widespread as in Western countries, India has its indigenous and diverse variations of cheese. Here are some popular Indian cheeses:

a. Paneer: Paneer, also called Indian cottage cheese, is an unaged, non-melting cheese made from curdled milk and a food acid like lemon juice or vinegar. Widely consumed in Indian dishes, it's used in savory preparations like paneer tikka, shahi paneer, and paneer butter masala, and in desserts like rasgulla and rasmalai.

b. Chhena: Chhena (or chhana) is similar to paneer but has a softer, crumbly texture. It's an essential component of most Bengali sweets like sandesh, chum chum, and kheer kadam.

c. Kalari: Also called maish krej, the traditional Kalari cheese hails from the Kashmir region. The milk used originates from either the cow or the buffalo. Often compared to mozzarella, it is served fried, accompanied by local spices and vegetables.

d. Dalle: Dalle, found predominantly in the Sikkim region, is a fermented and dried cheese made from cow's milk. Often used as a condiment or flavor enhancer, it lends itself to soups, stews, or curries.

e. Bandel: Originating from Bengal, Bandel cheese is a combination of Portuguese and Bengali cheese-making practices. It's available in two variants, plain and smoked, and is traditionally wrapped in palm leaves.

Additionally, due to globalization and changing dietary preferences, several international cheeses like cheddar, mozzarella, brie, camembert, and feta can be found at gourmet food stores, larger supermarkets, and online stores in India.
