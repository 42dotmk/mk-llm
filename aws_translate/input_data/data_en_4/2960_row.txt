In the small, secluded town of Forestview, a group of young boys, led by Jack and his friends' Matt, Danny, and Eric, enjoy exploring the numerous trails and hidden spots deep within the vast neighboring forest. On a hot summer day, as the boys trek through the woods on one of their many adventures, they veer off their usual path and come across something unexpected: a girl their age named Amina, standing in a small, forgotten clearing.

A flustered Amina introduces herself, mentioning that she's an orphan from a nearby village who has been living alone in the forest to escape the town's scrutiny. She explains that she possesses a strange magical ability to communicate with the animals, an ability she has honed while living in the woods.

Eager to learn more about Amina and her peculiar skill, the boys decide to go against their better judgment and bring her back to their treehouse hidden deep within the forest. They waste no time in showing her their secret hideout, and she instantly becomes a cherished member of their group.

Amina opens up to the boys, confiding that she can also see hidden paths throughout the woods that are invisible to others. As the friendship grows stronger, she reveals her life's dream: to solve the long-lost mystery of the Forgotten Woods, located in the heart of the forest. It's a place even Jack and his friends haven't dared to venture, fearing the dark legends surrounding it.

With newfound courage, they all decide to accept Amina's challenge and embark on a thrilling journey to uncover the secrets of the Forgotten Woods.

Amina learns that her magical abilities are a direct result of her lineage as a descendant of the kingdom's mystical royal family.
