Tom, a gifted but introverted software engineer in his late twenties, leads a simple and mundane life in the bustling city of New York. He goes to work at a prestigious tech company, attends Comic-Con events, and enjoys playing video games with his close-knit group of friends. However, something is missing in his life â€“ a connection to someone who truly understands him. 

Enter Samantha, his beautiful and enigmatic next-door neighbor. Samantha is an aspiring painter who becomes Tom's muse and the centerpiece of his world. From the moment she moves in, Tom finds himself inexplicably attracted to her. He spends countless hours watching her from afar, secretly collecting pieces of her life from her discarded art projects and documenting her routines. Inexplicably drawn to Samantha, he creates an entire world around her in a virtual reality simulation, building upon the bits and pieces he has gathered.

But Samantha has a secret of her own; she is on the run from a dark past, trying to escape the clutches of her manipulative and obsessive ex-boyfriend, Damien. Damien will stop at nothing to get her back, including threatening those closest to Samantha. 

As Tom's infatuation with Samantha grows stronger, he musters the courage to approach her. Surprisingly, Samantha finds herself grateful for the company and the two form an unlikely friendship. As they grow closer, Samantha confides in Tom about her dark past and troublesome relationship with Damien. Moved by her vulnerability, Tom vows to help her in any way he can.

Driven by his love for Samantha and his desire to protect her, Tom exploits his skills as a software engineer to hack into Damien's accounts, uncovering evidence of his criminal activities. When Tom anonymously tips off the police, Damien is arrested, allowing Samantha to breathe a sigh of relief.

Tom sees this as an opportunity to confess his love for Samantha. However, just as he is about to reveal his feelings, a dark secret from Tom's past emerges. In monitoring Samantha's every move, Tom had unknowingly recorded one of her intimate encounters with Damien.

As Tom's world crashes down around him, he is confronted by Samantha, who accidentally stumbled upon his virtual reality simulation.
