[Question]Johnson has a sack of potatoes. He gives Gina 69 potatoes, gives Tom twice as much potatoes as he gave Gina and gives one-third of the amount of potatoes he gave Tom to Anne. How many potatoes does he have left if the sack contains 300 potatoes?
[Answer]He gives twice 69 potatoes to Tom, which is 69 * 2 = 138 potatoes. He gives one - third of 138 potatoes to Anne, which is 138 * (1 / 3) = 46 potatoes. In total, he has given out 69 + 138 + 46 = 253 potatoes. He initially had 300 potatoes so he now has 300 - 253 = 47 potatoes left. The answer is 47.
Q: Marco has $24. Mary has $15. If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, Mary will have more than Marco. But Mary spends $5. How much more money does Mary have than Marco?
A: Half of what Marco has is $24 / 2 = $12. If he gives Mary $12, she has $12 + $15 = $27. Now subtract the money Mary spends: $27 - $5 = $22. Now subtract Marco's money from Mary's remaining money, $22 - $12 = $10. The answer is 10.
Question: Trevor and Joe were working together to finish a 500 piece puzzle. They put the border together first and that was 75 pieces. Trevor was able to place 105 pieces of the puzzle. Joe was able to place three times the number of puzzle pieces as Trevor. How many puzzle pieces are missing?
Answer: The puzzle is 500 pieces and the border used 75 pieces so 500 - 75 = 425 pieces left. Joe placed three times as many puzzle pieces as Trevor who placed 105 so Joe placed 3 * 105 = 315 piece. Together Joe and Trevor placed 315 + 105 pieces for a total of 420 pieces. With the border down that left 425 pieces left and they put down 420 pieces so that meant 425 - 420 = 5 pieces were missing. The answer is 5.
[Question]The battery charge in Maryâ€™s cordless vacuum cleaner lasts ten minutes. It takes her four minutes to vacuum each room in her house. Mary has three bedrooms, a kitchen, and a living room. How many times does Mary need to charge her vacuum cleaner to vacuum her whole house?
[Answer]Mary has 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 rooms in her house. At 4 minutes a room, it will take her 4 * 5 = 20 minutes to vacuum her whole house. At 10 minutes a charge, she will need to charge her vacuum cleaner 20 / 10 = 2 times to vacuum her whole house. The answer is 2.
Q: There were 100 people in attendance at the school dance. Ten percent of the attendees were school faculty and staff. Of the remaining attendees, two-thirds were girls. How many boys attended the school dance?
A: Of 100 people in attendance at the school dance, 10% were school faculty and staff, or a total of 0.1 * 100 = 10 people. This leaves 100 - 10 = 90 students in attendance. Of the remaining attendees, two - thirds were girls, or (2 / 3) * 90 = 60 attendees were girls. Thus, the remaining 90 - 60 = 30 students were boys who attended the school dance. The answer is 30.
