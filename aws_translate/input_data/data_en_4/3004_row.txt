There are 250 / 25 = 10 bundles of potatoes. So, 20 bundles of potatoes amount to $1.9 x 10 = $19. There are 320 / 20 = 16 bundles of carrots. So, 16 bundles of carrots amount to $2 x 16 = $32. Hence, the farmer got $19 + $32 = $51 in all.
The answer: 51
Reverse engineering the question: A farmer harvested 250 potatoes. He bundled them in twenty-five's and sold each bundle for $1.90. He also harvested 320 carrots and bundled them in twenty's and sold each bundle for $2. If the farmer sold all his harvested crops, how much did he get in all?

Reasoning and answer: They are to order a total of 3 burger meals and 3 sodas for Paulo and Jeremy. The cost of a soda is $6 / 3 = $2. So, the 3 sodas will amount to $2 / soda x 3 sodas = $6. The 3 burger meals will amount to $6 / burger x 3 burgers = $18. Hence, the total cost for their orders is $6 + $18 = $24.
The answer: 24

Question: Paulo wants to get a burger meal that costs $6. Aside from that, he also wants to get a soda which costs 1/3 as much as the burger meal. While on the counter, Jeremy asked Paulo to get him 2 of each item Paulo is going to get. How much will they be charged for their orders combined?

If each battery charge costs $3.5, the total expense of 4 battery charges is 4 * 3.5 = $14. After his expense on battery charging, his balance was 20 - 14 = $6.
The answer: 6
Reverse engineering the question: Hawkeye is driving to his aunt. He has to charge his battery for $3.5 per charge. If he charged his battery four times, and his battery charging budget was $20, how much money was he left with when he reached his aunt's place?

Reasoning and answer: Over 5 of the floors, it takes the elevator 5 floors * 5 minutes per floor = 25 minutes to lower. Over the final 5 floors, it takes the elevator 5 floors * 16 minutes per floor = 80 minutes to lower. So in total, the elevator takes 15 minutes in the first half + 25 minutes in the next five floors + 80 minutes in the final five floors = 120 minutes to lower to the bottom. This is the same as 120 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 2 hours.
The answer: 2

Question: Michael is stuck in an elevator that is slowly moving to the bottom floor. The elevator needs to move down 20 floors to reach the bottom. It takes 15 minutes for the elevator to travel down the first half of the floors. The elevator then takes 5 minutes per floor to travel down the next 5 floors. It then takes 16 minutes per floor for the elevator to finish traveling down the final 5 floors. In hours, how long did it take for the elevator to reach the bottom?

When Jennifer is 30 years old in ten years, her sister Jordana will be 3 * 30 = 90 years old. She's currently 10 years younger, so she's 90 - 10 = 80 years old.
The answer: 80
Reverse engineering the question: Jennifer will be 30 years old in ten years. At that time, her sister Jordana will be three times as old Jennifer. How old is Jennifer's sister now?

15 coins collected in hour one. 35 coins collected in hour two. 35 coins collected in hour three. 50 coins collected in hour four. Before giving her coworker some coins there were 15 + 35 + 35 + 50 = 135 coins. The number of coins after given 15 to her coworker is 135 - 15 = 120.
The answer: 120
