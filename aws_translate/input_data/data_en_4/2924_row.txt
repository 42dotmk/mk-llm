For some inexplicable reason, witnessing him in this state had a more profound impact on me than any other misfortune that had befallen me. It was an unexpected, emotionally jarring experience that shook me to my core, leaving me struggling to comprehend the severity of the situation. The overwhelming weight of helplessness consumed me as I stood there, staring at the unfolding event.

Losing those two crucial seconds, the brief period during which I remained frozen in time and space, proved disastrous for my meticulously orchestrated plan. It was a plan that demanded precise execution, a carefully choreographed sequence of actions that would culminate in our escape from this dangerous predicament. The slightest hiccup was enough to foil everything.

My primary goal was to alert Collin to our current circumstances using the unique bond we shared - a bond that allowed for ethereal communication, transcending the limitations of ordinary interaction. I was certain that he was within range, close enough to sense my urgent message through the ethereal connection, and together, we would make our move.

As for Al, I knew he was lurking nearby, like a predator poised for the kill, patiently waiting for the opportune moment to leap out and ensnare his unsuspecting prey. Anticipation gnawed at me, keeping me on high alert for any signs of his presence - a shadow darting across the floor, the faintest sound echoing through the halls. Time was of the essence, and I could not afford to be distracted.

The key to our success lay in the distinct metallic click, a seemingly insignificant noise that would act as the trigger for a series of events to unfold rapidly. This unassuming yet crucial sound was the bathroom door locking, sealing our fate within its confined quarters, and setting the stage for our impending clash between good and evil.

At that very instant, I was supposed to call off the plan. Instead, I hesitated, overcome by emotion and doubt. I should have reached out to Collin, signaling for him to spring into action and join forces with me in this high-stakes cat-and-mouse game. With the element of surprise on our side, we might have stood a chance at outsmarting and subduing Al, as well as escaping this dangerous web of deceit and intrigue unscathed.

But in those two vital seconds, I faltered. And as a consequence, the intricate plan we had carefully devised came crashing down like a house of cards, leaving us vulnerable and exposed, the distinct possibility of failure looming over us like a dark, ominous cloud. In that moment, I realized just how fragile the boundary between success and disaster can be, and how quickly the scales can tip toward either side when presented with unexpected challenges or emotionally charged situations.

The situation forced me to confront the sobering reality of our circumstances, and the devastating consequences that may ensue due to my momentary lapse in judgment. Time, once again, reared its head as a formidable force, underscoring just how critical it was to adhere to the plan as it was meticulously designed. For now, all we could do was brace ourselves for the unpredictable road ahead and hope that whatever future awaited us would be one forged by strength, cunning, and unwavering determination.
