Question: In a day, Sam hunts 6 animals. Rob hunts half as many animals as Sam. Mark hunts 1/3 of the total of what Rob and Sam hunt. If Peter hunts 3 times as many animals as Mark does, how many animals do they all hunt in a day?
Answer: Rob hunts 1 / 2 * 6 animals / day = 3 animals / day. Rob and Sam hunt 3 animals / day + 6 animals / day = 9 animals / day. Mark hunts 1 / 3 * 9 animals / day = 3 animals in a day. Peter hunts 3 * 3 animals / day = 9 animals in a day. The total they all hunt in a day is 6 animals / day + 3 animals / day + 3 animals / day + 9 animals / day = 21 animals. The answer is 21.
[Question]If the normal hours of operation of Jean's business are 4 pm to 10p every day Monday through Friday, and from 6 pm to 10 pm on weekends, how many hours is the business open in a week?
[Answer]First, we find the number of hours per weekday by subtracting the smaller number time from the larger one, finding 10 - 4 = 6 hours per weekday. As there are 5 weekdays, this means the business is open 6 * 5 = 30 hours a week on the weekdays. Then we find out the amount of time the business is open on a weekend day, using the same process as we did with the weekdays, finding Jean's business is open 10 - 6 = 4 hours each weekend day. Since there are two weekend days, this means they are open 4 * 2 = 8 hours on the weekends. We add these two totals together to find that 30 + 8 = 38 hours per week. The answer is 38.
Q: Martha spends 10 minutes turning the router off and on again, six times that long on hold with Comcast, and half as much time as she spent on hold yelling at a customer service representative. How much time did Martha spend on these activities total?
A: First find the total time Martha spent on hold: 10 minutes * 6 = 60 minutes. Then find the time she spent yelling: 60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes. Then add all the amount of time to find the total time: 60 minutes + 30 minutes + 10 minutes = 100 minutes. The answer is 100.
Question: Dana has 15 more pencils than Jayden, who has twice as much as Marcus. How many more pencils does Dana have than Marcus, if Jayden has 20 pencils?
Answer: Dana has 15 more pencils than Jayden who has 20, so Dana has 20 + 15 = 35 pencils. Jayden has 20 pencils which is twice as much as Marcus's so Marcus has 20 / 2 = 10 pencils. Dana has 35 - 10 = 25 more pencils than Marcus. The answer is 25.
[Question]Thomas made 4 stacks of wooden blocks. The first stack was 7 blocks tall. The second stack was 3 blocks taller than the first. The third stack was 6 blocks shorter than the second stack, and the fourth stack was 10 blocks taller than the third stack. If the fifth stack has twice as many blocks as the second stack, how many blocks did Thomas use in all?
[Answer]The second stack has 7 blocks + 3 blocks = 10 blocks. The third stack has 10 blocks - 6 blocks = 4 blocks. The fourth stack has 4 blocks + 10 blocks = 14 blocks. The fifth stack has 10 blocks x 2 = 20 blocks. In total there are 7 blocks + 10 blocks + 4 blocks + 14 blocks + 20 blocks = 55 blocks. The answer is 55.
