No, the sentence "Bohemia (as Czech civilization was known by then) increased in power over the centuries, as its language did in regional importance." does not provide a valid answer to the question "What did Jan Hus advocate for among the Czech commoners?". 

To provide a detailed and long answer to the question regarding Jan Hus' advocacy, let us first understand who Jan Hus was and the context of his actions.

Jan Hus (1369-1415) was a Czech priest, philosopher, theologian, and reformer, who later became an influential figure in the history of Christianity and Bohemia. Jan Hus is best known for his efforts to reform the practices and beliefs of the Catholic Church, which led to his excommunication and eventual execution by burning at the stake.

During the late 14th and early 15th centuries, there was a growing dissatisfaction among the people of Bohemia, including the Czech commoners, with the corruption and hierarchy within the Catholic Church. The Church was plagued by financial abuses, immorality among the clergy, and the lack of effective spiritual leadership. In this context, Jan Hus emerged as a seminal figure calling for much-needed changes.

Though Jan Hus was influenced by the English reformer John Wycliffe, he developed his own ideas that addressed the unique challenges of the Czech church and society. Some of the key advocacies of Jan Hus among the Czech commoners were:

1. Elimination of corruption and financial abuses in the Church: Jan Hus called for the reduction of the wealth and worldly power of the clergy. He argued that such wealth corrupted the Church and stood in the way of spiritual growth. This resonated with the Czech commoners who felt exploited by the Church's financial demands.

2. Encouragement of the use of the Czech language in liturgy: Jan Hus advocated for the use of the vernacular (Czech) language in religious services, making them more accessible and understandable to the commoners. This was significant because, at that time, Latin was the exclusive language used in the Church administration and liturgy, which effectively alienated common people from participating in their own spiritual life.

3. Communion under both kinds - bread and wine: Jan Hus promoted the administration of the Holy Eucharist in both forms (bread and wine) to all believers, not just the clergy. This practice was a way to emphasize the equality of all Christians before God and reduce the hierarchical divide between the clergy and the laity.

4. Importance of personal piety and Bible study: Hus believed that individuals could access God's truth through their own conscience and by studying the Bible directly, rather than relying solely on the interpretation of the Church's clerical hierarchy. This encouraged Czech commoners to seek a more personal and direct relationship with God.

While the sentence provided does not answer the question directly, it is important to acknowledge that Jan Hus' advocacy did contribute substantially to the empowerment of the Czech language, culture, and ultimately the influence of Bohemia in the region. Moreover, his reforming actions planted the seeds for the eventual emergence of Protestantism in Europe and the broader religious transformations that took place during the 16th century Reformation.
