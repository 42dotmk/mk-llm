In any case, however, decisive measures must be taken within weeks or at most months to prevent the next round of bloody conflicts from breaking out in Afghanistan.

The situation in Afghanistan is critical, and the urgency of taking immediate and decisive actions cannot be overstated. The aim of these measures should be to stabilize the country, provide support to its government and people, and prevent further escalation of violence and instability.

There are several key steps that should be taken in the short term to address this crisis:

1. Diplomatic engagement: International and regional powers, such as the United States, China, Russia, Iran, and Pakistan, have an important role to play in resolving the current crisis. Concerted diplomatic efforts must be made to encourage dialogue between the Afghan government, the Taliban, and other warring factions. This should involve the establishment of a framework for negotiations and confidence-building measures.

2. Security assistance: Strengthening the Afghan security forces should be a priority to ensure that they can confront the different factions and maintain control over key parts of the country. This can be achieved by providing training, equipment, and financial support to the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). Additionally, international peacekeeping forces may need to remain in the country for a longer period to support the ANSF and maintain security.

3. Humanitarian aid and development cooperation: The Afghan population suffers from endemic poverty, high unemployment, and limited access to essential services, such as healthcare and education. Improving the living conditions of Afghans should be a key aspect of the international community's engagement in the country. Providing humanitarian aid, facilitating the delivery of essential services, and promoting socioeconomic development should be integral components of these efforts.

4. Counter-terrorism cooperation: Afghanistan remains a breeding ground for extremist groups, such as the Islamic State. International cooperation should be reinforced to share intelligence, disrupt terrorist networks, and prevent the spread of these threats beyond Afghanistan's border. This will require close collaboration between different actors, including law enforcement agencies, intelligence services, and the military.

5. Addressing the drug trafficking problem: Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of opium, which fuels instability across the country and the region. Tackling this issue is crucial in order to undermine the funding sources of terrorist organizations and restore peace in Afghanistan. A comprehensive, long-term strategy is required, beginning with measures to disrupt drug production and traffic, followed by efforts to promote alternative livelihoods for Afghan farmers.

By implementing these steps, the international community will be better placed to prevent the outbreak of another bloody conflict in Afghanistan. The goal should be a stable, secure, and prosperous Afghanistan that can provide safety and economic opportunities for its citizens while contributing to regional peace and stability. This is a complex and challenging task that requires commitment, cooperation, and sustained effort from all the parties involved.
