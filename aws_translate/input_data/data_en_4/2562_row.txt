[Question]Stephanie is decorating 24 cupcakes for a birthday party, but she needs more candles. She currently has a total of 30 candles. She wants to decorate half of the cupcakes with 1 candle each and the other half of the cupcakes with 2 candles each. How many additional candles does Stephanie need to complete the cupcakes?
[Answer]For half of the cupcakes, Stephanie wants to use 1 candle each. Since half of the cupcakes is 24 / 2 and she plans to use 1 candle each for this half of the cupcakes, Stephanie needs (24 / 2) * 1 = 12 candles for this half of the cupcakes. For the other half of the cupcakes, Stephanie wants to use 2 candles. Therefore, she will need (24 / 2) * 2 = 24 candles for this half of the cupcakes. Because Stephanie needs 12 candles for half of the cupcakes and 24 candles for the other half, she needs a total of 12 + 24 = 36 candles. Since Stephanie needs 36 candles to decorate all the cupcakes and she currently has 30 candles, Stephanie needs 36 - 30 = 6 additional candles. The answer is 6.
Q: Frankie and Carla played 30 games of ping pong against each other. Frankie won half as many games as did Carla. How many games did Carla win?
A: Let x be the number of games that Frankie won. Then the number of games Carla won would be 2 * x. And the sum of all the games would be x + 2 * x = 30 games. Thus, the expression simplifies to 3 * x = 30. And the value of x = 10 games. Therefore, the number of Carla's wins would be 2x = 20 games. The answer is 20.
Question: Daniel owns a textile company. Every Monday he delivers 20 yards of fabric, and every Tuesday he delivers twice the amount of fabric he delivers on Monday. Every Wednesday, he delivers 1/4 of the amount of fabric he delivers on Tuesday. If each yard of fabric costs $2 and each yard of yarn costs $3, how much does he earn from Monday to Wednesday?
Answer: Every Tuesday, Daniel delivers 20 x 2 = 40 yards of fabric. Every Wednesday, he delivers 40 x 1 / 4 = 10 yards of fabric. Thus, he delivers a total of 20 + 40 + 10 = 70 yards of fabric from Monday to Wednesday. Therefore, Daniel earns $2 x 70 = $140 from it. The answer is 140.
[Question]Anna's mom gave her $10.00 to buy anything she wanted from the candy store. Anna bought 3 packs of chewing gum for $1.00 each, 5 chocolate bars at $1 each and 2 large candy canes for $0.50 each. How much money did Anna have left?
[Answer]Anna bought 3 packs of chewing gum that were $1 each for a total of 3 * 1 = $3. Anna bought 5 chocolate bars that were $1 each for a total of 5 * 1 = $5. Anna bought 2 large candy canes that were $.50 each for a total of 2 * .50 = $1. The total amount spent was $3 + $5 + $1 = $9.00. Anna had $10 to start and spent $9.00 so she had $10 - $9.00 = $1.00 left. The answer is 1.
