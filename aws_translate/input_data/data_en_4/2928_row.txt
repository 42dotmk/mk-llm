Title: "Butter Destiny"

The story centers around three main characters: Laura, a single mom and dedicated amateur butter-carver; Destiny, her precocious and imaginative 10-year-old daughter; and Carol-Ann, a quirky, endearing Bob Ross super-fan who is their next-door neighbor. Seizing the opportunity at the local butter carving competition, they unite and get ready to compete against Brooke, their biggest competitor. 

Laura never romanced the idea of butter carving before, she was more of a pragmatic woman, but when Destiny expresses an interest in this peculiar art form, she takes it up, not just to develop her artistic side but also as a way to build her relationship with Destiny. Carol-Ann provides emotional support and well-needed comic relief. Laura's unknown talent for butter carving gets released and she becomes an overnight sensation in their small town. 

Brooke, the antagonist, is a blue-blooded, high society, reigning champion of the butter carving competition. With some many times champion butter carving mom, she’s inherited the talent and the pompous attitude that feels threatened by Laura and Destiny's passionate talent. The whole district knows that standing against Brooke means a battle against years of dedication and perfection.

Their quiet life takes an unexpected turn when Laura's butter sculpture catches the eye of the butter carving committee. Suddenly she is invited to participate in the town's biggest competition. Brooke is not pleased with the new competition, and this sets the stage for a deliciously intense butter carving rival story. Brooke goes out of her way to sabotage Laura's work, provoking dramatic confrontations and mounting tension. 

Destiny dreams of overthrowing Brooke's reign and delivering the championship to her mom, who she sees as the most deserving. She provides a unique insight into the carvings, their meanings, and vibrant imagination that sets their artworks apart. Carol-Ann, in her humble and quirky ways, stands by them, raising morale, and occasionally even showing her own artistic skills, inspired by her idol, Bob Ross.

With Brooke’s harsh tactics, Laura and Destiny face multiple setbacks but they never give up. Amid trials they not only carve intricate butter sculptures but also their own destinities. Carol-Ann, their unwavering support, always manages to lighten up their atmosphere with her eccentricities based on Bob Ross's famous quotes or paintings. 

The movie culminates in a nail-biting finale competition where Brooke delivers a flawless piece representing the family's legacy; nevertheless, it lacks the heart that Laura's piece, inspired by her life changes after Destiny, and the quote from Carol-Ann's idol Bob, "there are no mistakes, only happy accidents." 

"Butter Destiny" not only showcases the intense rivalry between Laura and Brooke but also unfolds their personal development, the evolving mother-daughter bond, and an unsuspected friendship that goes beyond the butter carving competition. This kitschy comedy-drama offers a compelling mix of small-town politics, unlikely friendships, humor, and a lot of butter. It underlines the essence of creativity, integrity, and courage, reminding us that art is not always about perfection but the love and passion put into it.
