Q: Due to a drought, Jerry's household can only use 1000 gallons of water during July. Jerry uses 100 gallons for drinking and cooking and 20 gallons per shower. He wants to fill his pool, which measures 10 feet by 10 feet by 6 feet. If each gallon of water fills 1 cubic foot of the pool, how many showers can Jerry take in July?
A: First find the total volume of the pool: 10 feet * 10 feet * 6 feet = 600 cubic feet. This is also the number of gallons he needs to fill the pool. Subtract the pool water and the drinking and cooking water from the total amount of water Jerry is allowed to use: 1000 gallons - 600 gallons - 100 gallons = 300 gallons. Then divide the amount of water Jerry has left to use for showers by the amount of water per shower to find how many showers he can take: 300 gallons / 20 gallons / shower = 15 showers. The answer is 15.
Question: Half of Taylor's house guests like weak coffee and the other half like strong coffee in the morning. Taylor uses 1 tablespoon of coffee per cup of water to make it weak and he doubles that amount to make it strong. If he makes 12 cups of both weak and strong coffee, how many tablespoons of coffee will he need?
Answer: He uses 1 tablespoon for weak coffee and doubles that for strong so the strong uses 1 * 2 = 2 tablespoons. For the weak coffee he uses 1 tablespoon per 1 cup of water and he needs to make 12 cups so he'll use 1 * 12 = 12 tablespoons. For the strong coffee he uses 2 tablespoons per 1 cup of water and he needs to make 12 cups so he'll use 2 * 12 = 24 tablespoons. All total he will use 12 tablespoons for the weak coffee and 24 tablespoons for the strong coffee for a total of 12 + 24 = 36 tablespoons. The answer is 36.
[Question]Salem is 15 times the size of Leesburg. Leesburg has 58940 people. If 130000 people move out of Salem, and half of Salem's population is women, how many women live in Salem?
[Answer]The number of inhabitants of Salem is 15 * 58940 = 884100 inhabitants. But some have moved, so there are 884100 - 130000 = 754100 inhabitants left. Of these, 754100 / 2 = 377050 are women. The answer is 377050.
Q: Jackson collects 45 hermit crabs, 3 spiral shells per hermit crab, and 2 starfish per spiral shell. How many souvenirs does he collect total?
A: First find the number of spiral shells Jackson collects: 45 hermit crabs * 3 spiral shells / hermit crab = 135 spiral shells. Then find the number of starfish he collects: 135 spiral shells * 2 starfish / spiral shell = 270 starfish. Then add the number of each animal he collects to find the total number: 135 spiral shells + 270 starfish + 45 hermit crabs = 450 souvenirs. The answer is 450.
Question: There are 4 trains waiting at a train station and each train has 4 carriages. Each carriage has 3 rows of wheels and the rows of wheels have 5 wheels each. How many wheels are at the train station?
Answer: Each carriage has 3 rows of wheels * 5 wheels per row = 15 wheels. So each train has 4 carriages * 15 wheels per carriage = 60 wheels. There is therefore a total of 4 trains * 60 wheels per train = 240 wheels at the train station. The answer is 240.
