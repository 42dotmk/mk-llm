individual had consumed a variety of street foods from different vendors without considering the hygiene and freshness of the ingredients. This decision to indulge in potentially contaminated dishes, unfortunately, led to a constant, uncomfortable sensation in their gut. 

The stomach pain was likely caused by gastroenteritis, a condition resulting from an infection of the gastrointestinal tract. Factors such as bacterial or viral agents, parasites, or an upset in the balance of gut bacteria could be responsible for this ailment.

Throughout the day, the individual attempted to alleviate their discomfort using various home remedies and over-the-counter medications. However, their efforts met with limited success, as the pain persisted, becoming increasingly bothersome and affecting productivity in both personal and professional areas of their life.

In addition to stomach pain, the person experienced several other distressing symptoms, such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and fever. They recognized that the severity and duration of these symptoms were not only causing tremendous discomfort but also compromising their overall well-being. Although they had initially dismissed the idea of seeking medical attention, the consistency of their agony ultimately left them with no other choice.

Upon visiting a healthcare professional, they were asked to provide details about the events leading up to the development of their symptoms. The doctor paid particular attention to the types of street food consumed and whether any meals were prepared under questionable conditions. After gathering sufficient information, the doctor ordered laboratory tests, including blood work and a stool sample, to better understand the cause of the stomach ache and related symptoms.

Meanwhile, the individual was advised to stay hydrated by drinking water and oral rehydration solutions, and to eat a bland diet consisting of easy-to-digest foods such as bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. They were also prescribed anti-nausea medication and antidiarrheal drugs to lessen the severity of their symptoms.

As the test results came back, it was confirmed that the person's stomach ache was indeed caused by consuming contaminated street food, which introduced harmful bacteria and toxins within their body. Consequently, an appropriate treatment plan was designed. The doctor prescribed an antibiotic regimen to target bacteria and advised the individual to continue with the dietary recommendations and pain relief medications to help manage symptoms.

Furthermore, the individual was educated on the importance of food safety and hygiene, and urged to be more cautious in the future when consuming any food outside of their own kitchen. To minimize the risk of another episode, they would need to prioritize cleanliness, ensure proper food storage practices, and avoid consuming food from unknown sources.

In conclusion, the stomach ache that plagued the person throughout the day was a consequence of the poor quality of food ingested, emphasizing the need for vigilance and care when selecting meals. By adopting a more mindful approach in their future food choices, the individual can take steps toward experiencing healthier, happier, and pain-free days.
