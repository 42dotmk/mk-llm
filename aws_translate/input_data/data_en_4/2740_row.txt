According to an airing on an Arabic-language TV network, Al Arabiya, the man who pleaded guilty to the failed Times Square car bombing, Faisal Shahzad, declared before the incident that the strike would be a "revenge attack". Al Arabiya exhibited a tape allegedly containing a statement from the Pakistani-American who pleaded guilty in June following the attempted attack on May 1st. Given the lack of immediate verification of the tape's authenticity and the individual's appearance, the comments made in English were translated into Arabic for the news report. 

Shahzad expressed that the "revenge attack" would be conducted "in the name of all the mujahedeen, the fighters, and the weak and the oppressed Muslims." Notably, he mentioned Baitullah Mehsud and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, as well as the Muslims and Arabs who have been martyred. He stated his intent to exact revenge on their behalf, hoping that "the hearts of the Muslims will be pleased with this attack inshallah."

The involvement of Faisal Shahzad in the failed Times Square car bombing reflects the broader issue of radicalization among some individuals, and their connection to militant groups. In Shahzad's case, his apparent motivations were rooted in his alliance with extremist factions and his sympathy towards their cause. Specifically, his mention of Baitullah Mehsud and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, demonstrates his connection and potential inspiration drawn from these radical figures.

Mehsud, a prominent militant in Pakistan, was the leader of the Pakistani Taliban and was responsible for numerous terrorist attacks. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, on the other hand, was the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq who played a key role in planning and executing attacks against U.S. and coalition forces. Both figures represent significant elements of extremist and terrorist organizations. By invoking their names and the idea of revenge for oppressed Muslims, Shahzad's rhetoric reflects the allure and potential influence that such extremist figures can have on individuals who are motivated to engage in violence.

The airing of these remarks on Al Arabiya raises questions about the role of the media in portraying the motivations of terrorism-linked perpetrators, and the delicate balance between offering information and inadvertently glorifying their actions or objectives. While it is important to understand the context and motivations behind attempted acts of terrorism, there is a risk that exposing the statements of radicals might unintentionally provide a platform for their extremist beliefs. Repercussions of such exposure may include inspiring copycat attackers or inadvertently validating their grievance narratives among some members of their intended audience.

Al Arabiya's decision to air the tape reflects the complex nature of media coverage of terrorism and the need for a thoughtful and balanced approach that considers the potential consequences of providing terrorists, or would-be terrorists, with a platform to disseminate their messages. As the world grapples with the ongoing challenges of radicalization and extremist violence, it becomes increasingly important for media organizations to weigh the risks and benefits of reporting on such incidents and the messages of those involved.
