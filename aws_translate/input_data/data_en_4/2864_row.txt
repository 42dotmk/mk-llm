The two questions provided are asking about different topics of discussion. Let's break down each question and provide a detailed explanation for each.

1. Why do some people choose deliberately the negativity?

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to why some people deliberately choose negativity, but a few potential reasons could include:

a. Childhood or past experiences: A person's upbringing, along with traumatic or adverse experiences in their past, can shape their thought patterns and behaviors. They may have grown up around negative role models or in an environment where negativity was prevalent.

b. Defense Mechanism: Some people may use negativity as a coping mechanism to protect themselves from disappointments or emotional pain. It could be that they purposely set low expectations for themselves and others to avoid feeling let down.

c. Self-esteem and self-worth: A person with low self-esteem or sense of self-worth may struggle with negative thoughts and emotions. They may feel unworthy of success, happiness, or positive outcomes, and thus, unconsciously engage in negative thoughts and behaviors.

d. Habit: For some, negativity can become a learned habit over time. They might initially engage in negative thinking as a response to a particular situation, but eventually, it becomes ingrained in their overall personality.

e. Attention-seeking: In some cases, individuals may use negativity as a means to gain attention or sympathy from others. They might feel that negative behavior is more rewarding or noticeable than maintaining a positive attitude.
