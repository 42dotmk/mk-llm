Title: "Once Upon A Caesar"

"Once Upon A Caesar" is a coming-of-age drama film centered around the life of Richard, a teenage boy with a natural aptitude for English literature, particularly in the works of William Shakespeare.

The movie opens in a small suburban town in Ohio, where Richard, a high school junior, is reciting lines from Julius Caesar, in his English class. The teacher is astounded by Richard's prodigious understanding of the text, adding a fresh perspective to the class. Isolated as a bookworm by his friends, Richard finds solace in the world of literature. 

News about his remarkable interpretation of the play spreads around the school, thus attracting the attention of Candida, a popular senior girl who is directing the school's drama production. Candida, recognizing Richard's passion and talent, invites him to participate in the upcoming school's rendition of Julius Caesar.

Richard is then embarked on a new journey in his otherwise quiet life. At first, he's hesitant due to stage fear and disdain for the spotlight. However, with Candida's encouragement, he agrees to step out of his comfort zone and joins the drama team, reading for Brutus.

Amid his newfound popularity, Richard grapples with his changing social status and starts attracting the disdain of Redmond, the school's leading bully and the drama club's ousted star. The drama rehearsals parallel the plot of Julius Caesar, as behind-the-scenes conflicts, friendships' betrayals, and alliances form. Redmond, similar to Cassius in the play, becomes increasingly bitter and starts plotting against Richard out of jealousy.

However, this personal conflict is not the only problem Richard faces. As he delves deeper into the character of Brutus, he perceives a reflection into his own morality, the concept of loyalty and the harsh consequences of betrayal. These themes mirror his real life, as his old friends feel betrayed by his newfound popularity and he also questions his loyalty towards them.

As the day of the performance approaches, the tension between Richard, his old friends, and Redmond reaches its peak. Redmond, in an act of desperation, sabotages Richard's final rehearsal which results in Richard suffering a stage accident, echoing the fate of Julius Caesar.

Although upset, the incident helps Richard discover his sense of identity and worth. Gallantly, Richard decides not to let the incident dissuade him and overcome his stage fear. He learns to reconcile with fame and stand up to Redmond, just like Brutus mustered the courage to confront Caesar's ghost. His friendships regain stability as he makes amends with his past, letting them know he hasn't forgotten where he came from.

"Once Upon a Caesar" concludes with Richard's riveting performance on the opening night. His compelling and profound interpretation of Brutus leaves the audience, including Redmond, astounded, teaching everyone a lesson about resilience, friendship, and devotion to passion.

Thoroughly woven with intricate themes from the characters and plots of Julius Caesar, the movie explores intricacies of teenage dynamics, friendships, jealousy, courage, and self-discovery while subtly interspersing the essence of Shakespeare's works in a contemporary world of high school drama.
