[Question]Heather is going to sew 150 aprons that are to be used for a kiddie crew program. She already was able to sew 13 aprons, and today, she sewed three times as many aprons. How many aprons should she sew tomorrow if she wants to sew half of the remaining number of aprons needed?
[Answer]Heather has sewn 13 x 3 = 39 aprons today. The total number of aprons sewn is 13 + 39 = 52. Heather needs to sew 150 - 52 = 98 aprons more. So, she needs to sew 98 / 2 = 49 aprons tomorrow. The answer is 49.
Q: A business executive is going on a four day vacation where he will be unable to answer emails. The first day he is gone, he receives 16 new emails. On each of the following days, he receives half as many new emails as he received on the prior day. At the end of his four day vacation, how many new emails will he have received in total?
A: On the second day, the executive receives 16 / 2 = 8 new emails. On the third day, he receives 8 / 2 = 4 new emails. On the fourth day, he receives 4 / 2 = 2 new emails. Therefore, during the entire trip he will have received 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 new emails. The answer is 30.
Question: A smartphone seller is offering a discount of 5% off for customers who buy at least 2 smartphones at once. Melinda, Zoe and Joel want to buy an iPhone X each. If an iPhone X costs $600, how much can they save by pooling their money together and buying three iPhones at once from this seller rather than buying individually?
Answer: Each iPhone X cost $600 so three iPhone Xs without the discount would cost 3 * $600 = $1800. The discount is 5% and 5% of $1800 is (5 / 100) * $1800 = $90 which is what they get to save by buying collectively. The answer is 90.
[Question]Gerald is a furniture maker. He has 672 pieces of wood and he wants to make some tables and chairs. It takes 12 pieces of wood to make a table and 8 pieces of wood to make a chair. How many chairs can he make if he makes 24 tables?
[Answer]Each table takes 12 pieces of wood to make so 24 tables will take 24 * 12 = 288. There were originally 672 pieces of wood so now there are 672 - 288 = 384 pieces left. 8 pieces of wood make 1 chair so 384 pieces can make 384 / 8 = 48 chairs. The answer is 48.
Q: Lucius owns a small business and spends $10 every day on ingredients. He then makes a portion of French Fries and a portion of Poutine and sells them to the market, paying ten percent of his weekly income as tax. If the price of French fries is $12 and the price of Poutine is $8, how much does he earn every week after paying the taxes, selling all his products, and buying all the ingredients?
A: He earns $12 + $8 = $20 after selling the French fries and Poutine every day. So, he earns $20 x 7 = $140 every week. And the total amount he pays for the taxes is $140 x 0.10 = $14. So, his income after paying the weekly taxes is $140 - $14 = $126. Lucius spends $10 x 7 = $70 for the ingredients every week. Therefore, his total income every week after buying all the ingredients and paying the taxes is $126 - $70 = $56. The answer is 56.
