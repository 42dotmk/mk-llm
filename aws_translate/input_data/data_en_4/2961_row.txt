The individual in question was flustered for a variety of reasons during the speaking part of the interaction with the Russian lady. It is important to examine the context and possible factors leading to their emotional state in order to provide a detailed and comprehensive analysis. Below are some potential explanations as to why they might have felt flustered:

1. Unexpected Encounter: The person might not have anticipated being approached by someone and questioned. The surprise element of the interaction could have added to their flustered state, as they might not have had the time to mentally prepare themselves for such an encounter.

2. Language Barrier: The presence of a language barrier or the possession of limited proficiency in the Russian language might have contributed to their feeling of fluster. It can be challenging to hold a conversation in a foreign language, especially if one is not very comfortable or adept at using it. In this case, the person might have been struggling to understand the lady's questions and formulate coherent responses, resulting in their flustered demeanor.

3. Cultural Differences: The cultural backdrop of the individuals involved could also play a role in the emotional response. If the person is not familiar with Russian communication styles or social norms, it can lead to discomfort and fluster during the exchange. They may not have been sure how to behave or what was expected of them in the interaction.

4. Social Anxiety: The person may have been dealing with anxiety, particularly in social situations or when speaking with unfamiliar people. This can lead to nervousness, discomfort, and agitation, making it difficult to maintain a composed demeanor during the conversation.

5. Performance Pressure: The individual might have felt an immense amount of pressure to perform well in the conversation - whether it was to impress, prove their language abilities, or uphold their personal or professional reputation. The pressure to perform perfectly in any scenario can be overwhelming, leading to feelings of fluster and nervousness.

6. Context of the Conversation: The context in which the conversation took place could also have been a factor in the person's flustered state. If the surrounding environment was noisy, chaotic, or otherwise distracting, it could add to the difficulty of maintaining focus and confidence during the exchange.

7. Personal Factors: Finally, it is possible that the person might have been dealing with factors or events on a personal level that affected their emotional state during the interaction. Such factors could include stress, fatigue, or personal issues unrelated to the conversation but still influential in their overall demeanor.

In conclusion, the individual felt flustered during the speaking part of the interaction with the Russian lady due to a combination of factors, such as the unexpected nature of the encounter, language barrier, cultural differences, social anxiety, performance pressure, the context of the conversation, and personal factors. It is essential to understand that each person's emotional response to a situation can be influenced by a wide array of elements, and it might not always be possible to pinpoint one specific cause for their flustered state.
