[Question]A park warden has issued 24 citations over the past three hours. He issued the same number for littering as he did for off-leash dogs, and he issued double the number of other citations for parking fines. How many littering citations did the warden issue?
[Answer]Let L be the number of littering citations the warden issued. He issued 2L citations for littering and off - leash dogs, and 2 * 2L = 4L citations for parking fines. In all, he issued 2L + 4L = 6L = 24 citations. Thus, he issued L = 24 / 6 = 4 citations for littering. The answer is 4.
Q: Eunice spent $7500 on a used car, which is 25% less than the original price. What was the original price of the car?
A: The price $7500 is 100% - 25% = 75% of the original price. So, every 1% is equal to $7500 / 75% = $100. Hence, the original price is equal to $100 / 1% x 100% = $10000. The answer is 10000.
Question: To raise funds for her local soup kitchen, Didi enlisted the help of her family, friends, and neighbors. They donated 10 same-size cakes that she sliced into 8 slices per cake and started selling a slice for $1. A local business owner was so impressed by Didi's efforts that she offered to donate 50 cents for each slice Didi sold. A second business owner also offered to donate a quarter for each slice sold. If Didi sold all the slices, how much money did she raise?
Answer: All the cakes yielded 10 * 8 = 80 slices. Since Didi was selling each slice for $1, it means she sold everything for 80 * 1 = 80 dollars. The first business owner donated 50 / 100 * 80 = 40 dollars. The second business owner donated 25 / 100 * 80 = 20 dollars. Adding both amounts gives 80 + 40 + 20 = 140 dollars. The answer is 140.
[Question]In a store, there are three types of cheese: white, swiss, and blue cheese. Each cheese is packaged, and there are 200 grams of cheese in each package. The package prices are $5 for white cheese, $6 for swiss cheese, and $8 for blue cheese. Miley needed to get some for her party, and she decided to buy 5 packs of swiss cheese, 600 grams of blue cheese, and one-third less white cheese. How much did she need to pay for all the cheese?
[Answer]For the swiss cheese, Miley paid 5 * 6 = $30. 600 grams of blue cheese means 600 / 200 = 3 packages. So for the blue cheese, Miley paid 3 * 8 = $24. One - third of the blue cheese means 1 / 3 * 600 = 200 grams. So Miley bought only 600 - 200 = 400 grams of white cheese. Which means 400 / 200 = 2 packages. So for the white cheese, Miley paid 2 * 5 = $10. So in total for all the cheese, Miley paid 30 + 24 + 10 = $64. The answer is 64.
Q: Jade had $38 and her sister Julia had half as much money she had. On New Year's eve, their aunt gave each of them an equal amount of money so that they had a total of $97. How much did their aunt give each of them?
A: Julia had $38 / 2 = $19. Before their aunt gave them money, Jade and Julia had a total of $38 + $19 = $57. So, the total amount that their aunt gave them was $97 - $57 = $40. Thus, each of them was given $40 / 2 = $20. The answer is 20.
