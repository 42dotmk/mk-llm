The two questions you have asked are related, but they do not have the same meaning. I will address each question separately to provide a detailed and long answer.

Why are few people born transgender?

Transgender people are individuals whose gender identity (the internal sense of being male, female, or nonbinary) does not correspond with their assigned gender at birth (based on their biological sex). While the exact number of transgender people is difficult to estimate, it is generally considered a small percentage of the overall population. Various studies estimate that transgender people make up somewhere between 0.3% and 1.2% of the population, depending on the country and methodology.

There isn't a specific reason why there are relatively fewer transgender individuals than cisgender (those whose gender identity corresponds with their assigned gender at birth) individuals. Research is still ongoing to understand the underlying factors that contribute to someone being transgender.

Some studies suggest that genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors may play roles in the development of gender identity. For example, exposure to certain hormones before birth may influence brain development, resulting in a person's gender identity not aligning with their biological sex. Additionally, certain studies have found that there might be some genetic factors that contribute to being transgender, although these findings are still not definitive and require more research.

How are transgender people born?

While the precise cause of someone being transgender remains uncertain, evidence points to a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors that can contribute to this incongruity between a person's assigned gender at birth and their gender identity.

One theory involves prenatal exposure to certain hormones, particularly testosterone, during critical periods of brain development. This theory suggests that abnormal hormone exposure may result in transgender individuals developing a brain that is more similar to the opposite sex, leading to a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity.

Genetics may also play a role in being transgender. Research has identified specific genes that might be associated with transgender individuals, although it is important to remember that correlation does not necessarily imply causation, and further research is necessary to determine the relationship between these genes and being transgender.

Lastly, environmental factors may also contribute to being transgender. Some studies have found higher prevalence rates of transgender individuals among first-borns and fraternal twins, which might suggest an effect of the prenatal environment.

In summary, while the two questions you posed are closely related, they do not have the same meaning. The first question asks about the relatively small percentage of transgender people, while the second question focuses on the factors contributing to the development of transgender individuals. The answers provided suggest that a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors may play a role in the development of someone's gender identity, but more research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms fully.
