Question: John has just turned 39. 3 years ago, he was twice as old as James will be in 6 years. If James' older brother is 4 years older than James, how old is James' older brother?
Answer: John was 39 - 3 = 36 years old 3 years ago. So that means in 6 years James will be 36 / 2 = 18 years old. So right now James is 18 - 6 = 12 years old. So James's older brother is 12 + 4 = 16 years old. The answer is 16.
[Question]The chances of making the junior high basketball team start at 10% if you're 66 inches and increase 10% for every additional inch of height. Devin starts out as 65 inches tall, then grows 3 inches. What are his chances of making the basketball team?
[Answer]First find Devin's new height by adding his growth to the original height: 65 inches + 3 inches = 68 inches. Then subtract 66 inches from Devin's height to find how many extra inches of height he has: 68 inches - 66 inches = 2 inches. Then multiply the number of extra inches by the percentage increase per inch to find the total percentage increase in his chances: 2 inches * 10% / inch = 20%. Then add the percentage increase to the base percentage to find Devin's overall chance of making the basketball team: 10% + 20% = 30%. The answer is 30.
Q: Kayla and Kylie picked 200 apples total. Kayla picked 1/4 of the apples that Kylie picked. How many apples did Kayla pick?
A: Let x be the number of apples Kylie picked. Kayla picked (1 / 4)x apples. 200 = x + (1 / 4)x. 200 = (5 / 4)x. 200(4 / 5) = 160 = x apples. Kayla picked (1 / 4)(160) = 40 apples. The answer is 40.
Question: Helga works for a newspaper company. She can write 5 articles every 30 minutes, and she usually works 4 hours a day 5 days a week. If Helga worked an extra 2 hours last Thursday, and an extra 3 hours last Friday, how many articles was she able to write this week?
Answer: Helga writes 5 x 2 = 10 articles per hour. And she can write 10 x 4 = 40 articles every 4 hours. So, the total number of articles she usually writes for a week is 40 x 5 = 200 articles. She was able to write 10 x 2 = 20 articles on her extra 2 hours last Thursday. And she was able to write 10 x 3 = 30 articles on her extra hour last Friday. So, the total number of articles she was able to write on her extra hours is 20 + 30 = 50. Therefore, she was able to write a total of 200 + 50 = 250 this week. The answer is 250.
[Question]Jason's dog has a tail that's half the length of its body, and a head that's 1/6 the length of its body. If the dog is 30 inches long overall, how long is its tail?
[Answer]If b is the length of the body, h is the length of the head, and t is the length of the tail, we know that b + h + t = 30, h = b / 6 and t = b / 2. We can substitute the second two equations into the first equation to get b + b / 6 + b / 2 = 30. Now multiply both sides of this equation by 6: 6b + b + 3b = 180. Now combine like terms: 10b = 180. Now divide both sides by 10: b = 180. The dog's body is 18 inches long. Now divide that length by 2 to find the length of its tail: 18 inches / 2 = 9 inches. The answer is 9.
