First question: How did Aristotle's and Galileo's theories of motion differed from each other?

Aristotle's and Galileo's theories of motion have considerable differences, mainly because of their distinct approaches and the time periods they were developed. 

Aristotle's theory of motion (Aristotelian motion) was based on his observations and philosophical thoughts during the 4th century BCE. In his theory, he proposed several key ideas:

1. Natural motion: According to Aristotle, objects have a natural state they strive to achieve. For example, he believed that a rock falls to the ground because its natural place is the Earth's surface.
2. Forced motion: Aristotle stated that an object only continues to move when there is a continuous force applied to it, such as a person pushing a cart. Once the force stops, the movement also stops.
3. Motion is regarded as a combination of matter and form. Aristotle believed that objects moved due to a balance between their internal properties (matter and form) and external influences (natural forces).

On the other hand, Galileo Galilei, an Italian scientist born in the 16th century, came up with his theory of motion based on experiments and empirical evidence. He proposed the following concepts, which significantly differed from Aristotle's views:

1. Inertia: Galileo postulated that an object in motion stays in motion, and an object at rest stays at rest unless an external force acts upon it. The concept of inertia suggested that it isn't necessary for a constant force to be applied to maintain motion.
2. Uniform motion: Galileo studied objects falling (free fall) and the inclined plane to understand the natural behavior of objects in motion. He discovered that objects in free fall accelerate at a constant rate, regardless of their mass.
3. Galileo also investigated pendulum motion and, as a result, made significant contributions to the development of theories on momentum and kinetic energy.

Second question: How do the beliefs of the atomic theory from Democritus and Aristotle differ?

Democritus and Aristotle had contrasting views on the atomic theory. Democritus, a Greek philosopher born in the 5th century BCE, introduced the idea of indivisible and eternal particles called "atoms." According to Democritus:

1. Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of the universe and exist in various shapes and sizes.
2. Atoms combine in different configurations and ratios to create various compounds and elements.
3. Void or empty space exists between atoms, making it possible for them to move.

In contrast, Aristotle disagreed with Democritus' atomic theory and proposed a distinct concept called the four-element theory. According to Aristotle:

1. All matter is composed of four basic elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
2. These elements can be transformed into one another through a process called "substantial change".
3. Aristotle dismissed the existence of void and believed that there is no empty space between the elements.

As seen, these questions are not asking the same thing. The first question is about the differences between Aristotle's and Galileo's theories of motion, while the second question compares the beliefs in atomic theory by Democritus and Aristotle. Therefore, the answer is:

(A). no
