The missing first step in this process is the recognition and ingestion of food by the body, which initiates the digestion process. This step involves the process of consuming and breaking down the food through mechanical processes like chewing and chemical processes like the action of salivary enzymes. Here is a revised version of the process with the missing first step included:

1. The recognition and ingestion of food by the body: When a person consumes food, the digestion process begins through the mechanical act of chewing, which breaks the food down into smaller pieces. At the same time, salivary glands secrete saliva, which contains enzymes that start breaking down the food chemically. This mixture of broken-down food and saliva is then swallowed and passed down through the esophagus into the stomach.

2. They secrete digestive juice 'externally' into the small intestine: After the food has been partially digested in the stomach, the chyme (a semi-fluid mixture of partially digested food and stomach secretion) is released into the small intestine. The pancreas releases its digestive juices, containing enzymes that further break down the food components.

3. There are enzymes for breaking down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates: The digestive juices secreted by the pancreas contain enzymes such as lipase for breaking down fats, protease for breaking down proteins, and amylase for breaking down carbohydrates. These enzymes help break the complex macromolecules into smaller units that can be easily absorbed by the small intestine.

4. Digestive juices flow from the pancreas through an excretory duct into the small intestine: The digestive juices released by the pancreas flow through the pancreatic duct and into the small intestine, where they mix with the chyme and continue the process of breaking down the nutrients into smaller components that can be absorbed by the body.

5. When the blood sugar levels rise, as they might after a meal, insulin is released: The absorption of glucose (a monosaccharide resulting from the digestion of carbohydrates) by the small intestine causes an increase in blood sugar levels. In response, the pancreas secretes insulin, a hormone which helps to regulate blood sugar levels by promoting the uptake and storage of glucose in the body's cells, particularly in the liver and muscles.

6. When blood sugar levels are too low, the pancreas releases glucagon into the bloodstream: In contrast, when blood sugar levels fall below normal levels, such as during periods of fasting or intense physical activity, the pancreas releases another hormone called glucagon. Glucagon helps to raise blood sugar levels by stimulating the process of glycogenolysis (the breakdown of glycogen stored in the liver and muscles into glucose), which is then released into the bloodstream.

In summary, the missing first step in the described process is the recognition and ingestion of food, which involves the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food through chewing and the action of salivary enzymes. This initial step is crucial in initiating the various events leading to the proper digestion and absorption of nutrients and the regulation of blood sugar levels by the actions of insulin and glucagon.
