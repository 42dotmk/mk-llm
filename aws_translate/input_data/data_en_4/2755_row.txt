... (a). rice to be undercooked.

Susana had always been very particular about how she cooked her meals. Her grandmother, Abuela Sofia, taught her the importance of patience and attention to detail when it came to perfecting the art of Latin American cuisine. From stewed beans and yucca to delectable homemade tamales, Susana was dedicated to learning and mastering the recipes that had been passed down through the generations in her family.

One important lesson Abuela Sofia had instilled in her was the significance of properly cooked rice. "A perfect meal depends on a bed of perfect rice," Abuela would say with a stern finger wag. So today, as she prepared a lovely dinner for her two eldest sons who were visiting from college, Susana made sure her rice was cooked to perfection. 

Her sons, Miguel and Alejandro, had been away studying at prestigious universities, pursuing ambitious career paths. Susana knew they missed the comforts of home, and that meant putting extra care into her dishes. The aroma of sautéed onions and green peppers already permeated the air, enticing the senses while the rice simmered gently on the stove. 

She decided to remove the beef for now. She didn't want it to overcook while the rice reached its ideal texture – tender and slightly sticky but with each individual grain remaining intact. Susana set the marinated beef aside, letting it rest for a few moments as she shifted her focus back to the rice. A practiced hand, she didn't need a timer to tell her when it would be ready. Instead, she relied on her senses and intuition, honed after years of experience in the kitchen. 

As the rice continued to cook, she began preparing a salad, incorporating fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, and avocados, and even adding a hint of cilantro for a burst of flavor. The colors of the salad danced together, reminding her of the vibrant landscapes of her childhood in the small, bustling town outside of Mexico City that she and her grandmother called home. A sprinkle of lime juice and a dash of salt completed the dish, setting it aside as she returned to the rice pot.

A final taste confirmed that the rice was indeed ready - fluffy, fragrant, and perfectly cooked. At long last, Susana added the beef back to the pan, allowing the flavors to meld and the meat to sizzle and brown deliciously. She stirred the contents of the pan gently, distributing the hearty chunks of beef evenly amongst the seasoned rice, creating a warm and comforting meal her sons could enjoy; one that would remind them of where they came from and of the love that had nurtured them.

Miguel and Alejandro arrived just as Susana put the finishing touches on the meal. Their smiles grew wider and their eyes sparked with familiarity as they recognized the familiar scents of their mother's lovingly prepared meal. As they settled at the table, Susana joined them, beaming with pride and delight as they began digging in, savoring the flavors of home.

The laughter and stories filled the air, and for Susana, she knew that all the attention to detail had paid off. Her perfect rice was not only the foundation of a delicious meal, but a bridge between the generations – a loving reminder of her Abuela's wisdom and a cherished bond that connected them all, always.
