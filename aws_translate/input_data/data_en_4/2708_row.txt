Question: When Suzy the librarian sat at her desk on Wednesday morning, she had 98 books ready for checkout. The same day, 43 books were checked out. The following day, 23 books were returned, but 5 books were checked out. On Friday, 7 books were returned. How many books did Suzy have?
Answer: When 43 books were checked out on Wednesday, Suzy remained with 98 - 43 = 55 books. After 23 books were returned on Thursday, she ended with 55 + 23 = 78 books. However, 5 books were checked out on the same day meaning that 78 - 5 = 73 books were left. After 7 books were returned on Friday, Suzy had 73 + 7 = 80 books. The answer is 80.
[Question]Charlie can make 5350 steps while running on a 3-kilometer running field. If he can run around the field 2 1/2 times during a running session, how many steps was he able to make?
[Answer]Charlie's steps for 3 kilometers is 5350 x 2 = 10700 steps were made when he run twice the field.

Question: Maya's organization hosted a weekly farmers' market to raise money for the church choir. They sold broccolis, carrots, spinach, and cauliflowers. After adding together all of their earnings, Maya found out that they had made $380. The organization made $57 from broccoli and the sales of the carrots are twice as much as the sales of broccoli. Then, their sales for the spinach is $16 more than half of the sales of carrots. How much did they make from cauliflower sales?
Answer: The sales of the carrot is 57 x 2 = $114. Half the sales of carrot is $114 / 2 = $57. So, the sales of the spinach is $57 + $16 = 73. The total sales of the broccolis, carrots, spinach is $57 + $114 + $73 = $244. They made $380 - $244 = $136 from cauliflower sales. The answer is 136.
[Question]A carton contains 12 boxes. If each box has 10 packs of cheese cookies, what's the price of a pack of cheese cookies if a dozen cartons cost $1440?
