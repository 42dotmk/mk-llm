Question: Martin owns a farm with hens. 10 hens do lay 80 eggs in 10 days. Martin decided to buy 15 more hens. How many eggs will all hens lay in 15 days?
Answer: If 10 hens lay 80 eggs, then 1 hen lays 80 / 10 = 8 eggs in 10 days. That means one hen is laying 8 / 2 = 4 eggs in 5 days. So in 15 days, 1 hen will lay 3 times more eggs, so 4 * 3 = 12 eggs. All hens in total will then lay 25 * 12 = 300 eggs in 15 days. The answer is 300.
[Question]Peggy fell off her bike and skinned her knees. She needed two bandages on her left knee and three bandages on her right knee. If the box of bandages had 8 less than two dozen bandages before Peggy skinned her knees, how many bandages were left in the box after Peggy finished putting bandages on her knees?
[Answer]Two dozen is 12 * 2 = 24. Eight less than two dozen bandages is 24 - 8 = 16 bandages. She needed two bandages on her left knee and three bandages on her right knee for a total of 2 + 3 = 5 bandages. Therefore, after Peggy finished putting bandages on her knees there were 16 - 5 = 11 bandages remaining in the box. The answer is 11.
Q: A book library charges fifty cents per day on any book borrowed by its members to read outside the library's premises. At the start of May, Celine borrowed three books from the library to read at home for her upcoming examinations. If she returned one book 20 days after borrowing it, and the other two stayed at her house until the end of May, calculate the total amount of money that she paid at the library for lending the three books.
A: Celine was charged $0.50 * 20 = $10 for the book she returned to the library after 20 days. If the other two books stayed at her house until the end of May, she paid 31 * $0.50 = $15.5 for each book. For the two books that stayed at her house until the end of May, Celine paid $15.5 * 2 = $31. For the three books, Celine paid $31 + 10 = $41. The answer is 41.
Question: Josie's mom gave her a $20 bill and asked her to go to the store for a few items. The list included a carton of milk for $4.00, a loaf of bread for $3.50, a box of laundry detergent for $10.25 and 2 pounds of bananas that were $0.75 per pound. Her mom also gave her a coupon for $1.25 off of the laundry detergent. At checkout, the clerk told her the milk was 1/2 off today. How much money did Josie have left over after she bought all of the groceries?
Answer: The milk cost $4.00 but was on sale for 1 / 2 off so 4 * .50 = $2.00. She bought 2 pounds of bananas at $0.75 per pound so 2 * .75 = $1.50. She had a $1.25 coupon off of laundry detergent so 10.25 - 1.25 = $9.00. When you add all of her purchases together then 2 + 1.50 + 3.50 + 9.00 = $16.00. She paid with a $20 bill so 20 - 16 = $4 left over. The answer is 4.
[Question]John decided to buy 10 pins for himself. They are normally $20 each but they were on sale for 15% off. How much did he spend on pins?
