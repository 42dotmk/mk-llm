Question: Marge planted 23 seeds in her garden. Five of the seeds never grew into plants. A third of the remaining seeds grew, but the plants were eaten by squirrels and rabbits. A third of the number of uneaten plants were strangled by weeds. Marge pulled two weeds, but liked the flowers on one weed and let the plant grow as part of her garden. How many plants did Marge end up with?
Answer: Marge had 23 - 5 = 18 seeds grow into plants. Rabbits ate 18 / 3 = 6 plants. There were 18 - 6 = 12 plants left. Weeds strangled 12 / 3 = 4 plants. She had 12 - 4 = 8 plants left. Marge kept 1 weed, so she ended up with 8 + 1 = 9 plants. The answer is 9.
[Question]Ben starts each day with $50, spends $15 every day and saves the rest. After a few days, his mom doubled his total savings and his dad gave him an additional $10. If he now has $500, How many days have elapsed?
[Answer]Let the number of days be x. He saves $50 - $15 = $35 each day. After x days he had saved $35 * x = $35x. His mom doubled his savings to give $35x * 2 = $70x. His dad added $10 to give $70x + $10 = $500. Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation formed gives $70x = 490. Dividing both sides by $70 give x = 7 days. The answer is 7.
Q: Mark buys a loaf of bread for $4.20 and some cheese for $2.05. He gives the cashier $7.00. If the cashier only has 1 quarter and 1 dime in his till, plus a bunch of nickels, how many nickels does Mark get in his change?
A: First subtract the cost of Mark's groceries from the amount he gives the cashier to find how much he gets in change: $7.00 - $4.20 - $2.05 = $0.75. Then subtract the value of a quarter in cents (25) and the value of a dime in cents (10) from the change amount to find how much Mark gets paid in nickels: $0.75 - $0.25 - $0.10 = $0.40. Now divide the amount Mark gets in nickels by the value per nickel in cents (5) to find how many nickels Mark gets: $0.40 / $0.05 / nickel = 8 nickels. The answer is 8.
Question: Max was doing homework in three different subjects. It took him 20 minutes to finish tasks from biology and two times more time to finish history. Geography took him the most time, three times more than history. How much time did Max spend on doing his homework?
Answer: Max finished history in 20 * 2 = 40 minutes. Finishing geography took the most time, which is 40 * 3 = 120 minutes. In total, for all three subjects, Max needed 20 + 40 + 120 = 180 minutes. The answer is 180.
[Question]Twice Betty's age is the cost of a pack of nuts. Doug, Betty's friend, is 40 years old. If the sum of their ages is 90, and Betty wants to buy 20 packs of the nuts, calculate the amount of money she'll pay for the packs of nuts.
[Answer]If Doug, Betty's friend, is 40 years old, and the sum of their ages is 90, Betty is 90 - 40 = 50 years old. Since twice Betty's age is the cost of a pack of nuts, a pack of nuts is sold at 2 * $50 = $100. If Betty wants to buy 20 packs of the nuts, she'll have to pay 20 * $100 = $2000. The answer is 2000.
