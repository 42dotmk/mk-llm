First find the total number of basil leaves: 3 pots * 4 leaves / pot = 12 leaves. Then find the total number of rosemary leaves: 9 pots * 18 leaves / pot = 162 leaves. Then find the total number of thyme leaves: 6 pots * 30 leaves / pot = 180 leaves. Then add the number of each type of leaf to find the total number of leaves: 12 leaves + 162 leaves + 180 leaves = 354 leaves.
The answer: 354
Reverse engineering the question: Annie plants 3 pots of basil, 9 pots of rosemary, and 6 pots of thyme. Each basil plant has 4 leaves, each rosemary plant has 18 leaves, and each thyme plant has 30 leaves. How many leaves are there total?

Reasoning and answer: If the final number of geese was 12, which included the 4 that joined from the trees, then before these 4 joined, there were 12 - 4 = 8 geese in the sky. Since these 8 geese represent the half of geese remaining, then the initial formation contained 8 * 2 = 16 geese.
The answer: 16
What was the question?
Question: Albert noticed a flock of geese flying together in a V formation in the sky overhead. One half of the geese broke off from the formation, flew toward the earth, and landed in some trees. Then, 4 geese flew up, out of the trees, and joined those already flying in the air to make a new V formation in the sky. If the final number of geese flying in the V formation was 12, how many geese were in the first formation Albert noticed in the sky?

Machine A can put caps on 12 x 10 = 120 bottles in 10 minutes. Machine B can put caps on 12 - 2 = 10 bottles in 1 minute. So in 10 minutes, machine B can put caps on 10 x 10 = 100 bottles. Machine c can put caps on 10 + 5 = 15 bottles in 1 minute. So in 10 minutes, machine C can put caps on 15 x 10 = 150 bottles. Therefore, the three machines can put caps on 120 + 100 + 150 = 370 bottles in 10 minutes.
The answer: 370
Reverse engineering the question: There are three machines in a factory. Machine A can put caps on 12 bottles in 1 minute. Machine B can put caps to 2 fewer bottles than Machine A. Machine C can put caps to 5 more bottles than Machine B. How many bottles can those three machines put caps on in 10 minutes?

Reasoning and answer: 1491 + 3025 = 4516. 4516 + 1768 = 6284. There are 6284 flowers at the Greene Nursery.
The answer: 6284

Question: At the Greene Nursery, there are 1491 red roses, 3025 yellow carnations, and 1768 white roses. How many flowers are at the Greene Nursery in total?

He will write for 120 hours because 2 x 60 = 120. He will write for 24 units of five minutes each because 120 / 5 = 24. He can write 600 words because 24 x 25 = 600. He can earn $6 because 600 x .01 = 6.
The answer: 6
Reverse engineering the question: Rikki is writing and selling poetry. He sells his poems for $.01 a word. He can write 25 words of poetry in 5 minutes. If he has 2 hours to write poetry, how much can he expect to earn?

If Bom has 300 seeds, then Gwi has 300 + 40 = 340 watermelon seeds. Together, Bom and Gwi have 340 + 300 = 640 melon seeds. Yeon's number of watermelon seeds is three times as many as the number that Gwi has, meaning Yeon has 3 * 340 = 1020 watermelon seeds. Together, the three friends have 1020 + 640 = 1660 watermelon seeds.
The answer: 1660
