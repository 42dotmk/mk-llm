[Question]Radhika got a new gaming system and asked everyone to get her games as gifts to add to the games she already has that she bought with her gaming system. On Christmas, she is given 12 new video games. On her birthday in February, she is given 8 more video games. Radhika already owned 1/2 the number of games as what she was given on Christmas and her birthday. How many video games does she own now?
[Answer]Radhika was given 12 video games on Christmas and 8 video games on her birthday, so she was given 12 + 8 = 20 video games. She had 1 / 2 this many before she was given gifts, 20 / 2 = 10 video games she already owned. She was given 20 video games and had 10 already, 20 + 10 = 30 video games. Now Radhika has 30 video games. The answer is 30.
Q: There are three dogs in the backyard. They like apples, blueberries, and bonnies. The first dog, which likes apples, eats 3 times as many apples as the number of blueberries eaten by the second dog that likes blueberries. The dog that likes blueberries eats 3/4 times as many blueberries as the number of bonnies eaten by the third dog. If the dog that likes bonnies ate 60 of them, calculate the total number of fruits eaten by the three dogs?
A: The dog that likes blueberries ate 3 / 4 * 60 = 45 blueberries, 3 / 4 as many blueberries as the number of bonnies eaten by the third dog. The total number of fruits eaten by the dog that likes bonnies and the one that like blueberries is 45 + 60 = 105. The first dog that likes apples ate 3 * 45 = 135 apples which are 3 times as many blueberries as the number eaten by the dog that likes blueberries. In total, the three dogs ate 105 + 135 = 240 fruits. The answer is 240.

[Question]An ice cream vendor has 50 chocolate-flavored ice creams and 54 mango-flavored ice creams in his cart. If he sold 3/5 of the chocolate-flavored ice creams and 2/3 of the mango-flavored ice creams, how many total ice creams were not sold?
[Answer]There were a total of 50 + 54 = 104 ice creams. There were 50 x 3 / 5 = 30 chocolate - flavored ice creams sold. There were 54 x 2 / 3 = 36 mango - flavored ice creams sold. A total of 30 + 36 = 66 ice creams were sold. So, 104 - 66 = 38 ice creams were not sold. The answer is 38.
Q: Milo's parents tell him that he can win cash rewards for good grades. He will get $5 times the average grade he gets. He gets three 2s, four 3s, a 4, and a 5. How much cash does he get?
A: His total score is 27 because (3 x 2) + (4 x 3) + 4 + 5 = 27. His total number of grades is 9 because 3 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 9. His average grade is a 3 because 27 / 9 = 3. He earns $15 because 5 x 3 = 15. The answer is 15.
