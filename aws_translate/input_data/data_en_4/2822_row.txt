No, these questions do not have the same meaning. While they both relate to choosing between a B.Tech and a B.Sc degree, they focus on different aspects.

The first question, "What is the difference between a BTech and a BSc?" is a more general inquiry. It seeks to understand the key distinctions, similarities, and differences between Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) and Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) degrees. This question aims to gain comparative knowledge about these two degree programs.

A B.Tech degree typically focuses on technical and engineering disciplines. It is designed for students who want to pursue careers in fields such as computer science, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, and other technology-driven industries. The coursework tends to emphasize practical, hands-on learning, and the application of technical skills required in these industries.

A B.Sc degree, on the other hand, usually encompasses a broader range of scientific disciplines including natural sciences, life sciences, and mathematical sciences. It is intended for students who want to delve deeper into subjects like physics, chemistry, biology, or mathematics, and explore research-based or academic careers. The curriculum often combines theoretical knowledge with scientific reasoning and experimentation.

The second question, "I have been selected for the class of 2018. How do I decide between a BTech and a BSC at Ashoka?" is specific to a particular university (Ashoka) and alludes to the fact that the person is part of the class of 2018. This question is more about seeking guidance on the decision-making process when choosing between a B.Tech and a B.Sc degree at Ashoka University.
