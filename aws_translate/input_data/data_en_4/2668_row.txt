Question: Hannah sold 40 pieces of cookies for $0.8 each and 30 cupcakes for $2 each. She used the money to buy 2 sets of measuring spoons for $6.5 each. How much money does she have left?
Answer: Hannah's earnings from the cookies is 40 x $0.8 = $32. Her earnings from the cupcakes is 30 x $2 = $60. Her total earnings for the cupcakes and cookies is $32 + $60 = $92. The cost of 2 sets of measuring spoons is 2 x $6.5 = $13. So, Hannah has $92 - $13 = $79. The answer is 79.
[Question]A salon has the same amount of customers every day. Each customer needs 1 can of hairspray during the styling and is also given 1 can of hairspray to take home. The salon also buys an extra 5 cans of hairspray each day to ensure there is never a shortage. If the salon buys 33 cans of hairspray every day, how many customers do they have each day?
[Answer]Removing the surplus hairspray shows the salon needs 33 total cans of hairspray â€“ 5 surplus cans of hairspray = 28 cans of hairspray for each customer. Each customer needs 1 can of hairspray for styling + 1 can of hairspray to take home = 2 cans of hairspray. So the salon has a total of 28 cans of hairspray / 2 cans of hairspray per customer = 14 customers. The answer is 14.
Q: Bill is laying power cable for a new neighborhood. There are going to be 18 east-west streets that are 2 miles long and 10 north-south streets that are four miles long. It takes 5 miles of cable to electrify 1 mile of street. If cable costs $2000/mile, what is the total cost of cable for the neighborhood?
A: First find the total distance of the east - west streets: 18 streets * 2 miles / street = 36 miles. Then find the total distance of the north - south streets: 10 streets * 4 miles / street = 40 miles. Then add the number of miles from each type of street to find the total distance: 36 miles + 40 miles = 76 miles. Then multiply that number by 5 to find the number of miles of cable needed: 76 miles street * 5 miles cable / mile street = 380 miles of cable. Then multiply that number by the cost of one mile of cable to find the total cost: 380 miles * $2000 / mile = $760,000. The answer is 760000.

[Question]My mother celebrated her birthday with a total of 60 guests. Half of the guests are women, 15 are men, and the rest are children. In the middle of the celebration, 1/3 of the men and 5 children left. How many people stayed and enjoyed the birthday celebration?
[Answer]There were 60 guests / 2 = 30 women at my mother's birthday celebration. There were 30 women + 15 men = 45 men and women. So, 60 people - 45 men and women = 15 were children. Then, 15 men / 3 = 5 men left. Thus, 5 men + 5 children = 10 people left. Therefore, 60 people - 10 people = 50 people stayed and enjoyed the birthday celebration. The answer is 50.
