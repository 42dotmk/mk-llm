Q: Cole wants to fence his backyard on three sides. His backyard is 9 feet along the sides and 18 feet along the back. The neighbor behind him agreed to pay for half of their shared side of his fence, and the neighbor on his left agreed to pay for a third of their shared side. Fencing costs $3 per foot. How much does Cole have to pay for the fence?
A: Cole has to pay 3 * 9 = $27 for one side of the side fence. For the shared left fence, he has to pay two - thirds of 27, so he has to pay 27 * 2 / 3 = $18. The shared back fence will cost 3 * 18 = $54. He has to pay for half the back fence, so it will cost 54 / 2 = $27. Thus, Cole has to pay 18 + 27 + 27 = $72 for the fence. The answer is 72.
Question: Jolene and Phil have four children, each with the same birthday. They gave birth to their first child exactly 15 years ago. They gave birth to their second child exactly one year after the birth of their first child. They gave birth to their third child on the fourth birthday of their second child. Two years after the birth of their third child, they gave birth to their fourth child. How old, in years, is their fourth child?
Answer: Their 1st child was born 15 years ago, and therefore is 15 years old. Their 2nd child was born 1 year after their 15 - year - old child, and therefore is 15 - 1 = 14 years old. Their 3rd child was born 4 years after their 14 - year - old child, and therefore is 14 - 4 = 10 years old. Their 4th child was born 2 years after their 10 - year - old child, and therefore is 10 - 2 = 8 years old. The answer is 8.
[Question]John puts $25 in his piggy bank every month for 2 years to save up for a vacation. He had to spend $400 from his piggy bank savings last week to repair his car. How many dollars are left in his piggy bank?
[Answer]He saved money for 2 years, which is equal to 12 x 2 = 24 months. The amount of money he saved is $25 * 24 = $600. But he spent some money so there is $600 - $400 = 200 left. The answer is 200.
Q: Alfonso earns $6 each day walking his auntâ€™s dog. He is saving to buy a mountain bike helmet for $340. Currently, he already has $40. If he walks his aunt's dog 5 days a week, in how many weeks should Alfonso work to buy his mountain bike?
A: Alfonso has to work for the $340 - $40 = $300. In a week, he earns $6 x 5 = $30. Thus, he needs to work $300 / $30 = 10 weeks to buy the bike. The answer is 10.
Question: A wild tiger escapes the zoo. He escapes at 1 AM and zookeepers do not notice he is missing until 4 AM. He runs at a speed of 25 mph. It takes 2 more hours to find him but after 4 hours of running, the tiger slows his speed to 10 mph. He then gets chased for half an hour going 50 mph. How far away from the zoo was he caught?
Answer: He was running for 4 - 1 = 3 hours. So in that time he runs 3 * 25 = 75 miles. Since he slowed down after 4 hours, the time he spent running at 25mph was an additional 4 - 3 = 1 hours. So in the first hour they were finding him, he ran 1 * 25 = 25 miles. In the second hour they were finding him, he ran 1 * 10 = 10 miles. Finally, during the chase, he ran 50 * .5 = 25 miles. So he is 75 + 25 + 10 + 25 = 135 miles away. The answer is 135.
