Title: £63 Million Mansion: Redefining Luxury and the Value of Space

Intro:

Luxury real estates have always caught the eye of the ultra-wealthy, and today, we take a closer look at a unique estate that has broken records with its price tag. Listed at a whopping £63 million, this property is not only one of the most expensive in the world, but also holds the title for the highest cost per square foot. Let's explore the different facets of this extraordinary house and what makes it so valuable.

Step 1: Discuss the basic features & listing information

The £63 million house has been listed by Sun Hung Kai Properties, a prestigious real estate developer known for its luxurious and well-crafted properties. Located in a prime location, this estate is one of 12 exclusive luxury homes currently on the market. Despite its high price, the liveable area of this house stands at just 4,600 square feet, making the cost per square foot even more impressive and quickly catching the attention of luxury home seekers.

Step 2: Compare the size & cost of the house to the London flat

To better understand the value proposition of this unique property, it is worth comparing it to other luxury homes on the market. In particular, let's look at the £140 million flat in London, which is another property landmark with an astounding price. Interestingly, while the London flat's value is undoubtedly remarkable, its size is almost four times larger than the £63 million house, spanning around 16,000 square feet of liveable space.

This comparison shows that the £63 million house truly stands out in terms of the value it places on each square foot. With a selling price of approximately £13,695 per square foot, it is evident that this property breaks existing records.

Step 3: Discuss the key selling points for this property

Identifying what makes this home so extraordinary is essential in understanding why individuals would be willing to invest such a significant sum in a relatively smaller living space. Some of its most notable features include an excellent location, state-of-the-art architecture, and exclusive amenities such as private elevators, a rooftop swimming pool, and access to top-notch security services. Furthermore, the property's limited availability adds to its desirability since there are only 12 such luxury homes on the market.

Step 4: Conclude and state the significance of this luxurious property

To conclude, the £63 million house's unprecedented cost per square foot changes how we perceive the value of space in luxury real estates. This trendsetting property emphasizes the importance of location and exclusivity, urging luxury home buyers to give priority to these characteristics instead of solely focusing on size. By breaking records and setting a new benchmark for cost per square foot, the £63 million house has undoubtedly raised the bar for future luxury home listings and sales.

This house signifies how luxury living is not merely about vast spaces and opulent designs, but also about the scarce availability, the exclusivity of the location, and the unique features it has to offer. With this paradigm shift in luxury real estate, the future of the luxury property market is bound to become even more competitive and innovative.
