In this regard, we attach great importance to the successful completion of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA).

The Doha Development Agenda (DDA) is a comprehensive plan for international trade and development that was initiated in November 2001 at the 4th Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Doha, Qatar. The primary goal of the DDA is to integrate developing countries and least developed countries (LDCs) into the global trading system, while addressing various trade-related issues, including market access and trade rules.

The DDA consists of several elements, including:

1. Market Access: The objective is to improve market access for goods and services traded between countries by reducing barriers such as tariffs, quotas, and subsidies. Market access negotiations under the DDA have focused on key sectors such as agriculture, non-agricultural market access (NAMA), and services.

2. Agriculture: Agriculture is a crucial sector in international trade negotiations due to its significance in global food security and economic development. The DDA aims to introduce significant reforms in agriculture by lowering trade barriers, reducing domestic support measures that distort trade, and eliminating export subsidies.

3. Development: Development is at the core of the DDA, as a significant part of the agenda is dedicated to addressing the challenges faced by developing countries and LDCs in integrating into the global trading system. The DDA provides a 'Special and Differential Treatment' (SDT) to these countries, offering them more time and flexibility to adjust to new rules and commitments.

4. Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS): The DDA includes discussions on improving the TRIPS agreement to provide better protection for intellectual property rights while addressing public health concerns, especially in developing countries.

5. Trade Facilitation: This involves simplifying customs procedures to reduce the cost and time taken in the movement of goods across borders. The Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) was agreed upon in 2013 during the 9th Ministerial Conference in Bali, Indonesia, and highlights one of the successful outcomes of the DDA.

6. Rules: The DDA seeks to improve and clarify various trade rules, such as anti-dumping, subsidies, countervailing measures, and regional trade agreements, to ensure a more transparent and fair global trading system.

Despite the importance of the Doha Development Agenda and numerous efforts by WTO members, the negotiations have faced several challenges and have not yet been concluded. Reasons for the lack of conclusion include disagreements between developed and developing countries on crucial issues such as agricultural subsidies and industrial tariffs and the changing global economic landscape, which has given rise to new players dominating international trade.

Nonetheless, finalizing the Doha Development Agenda remains a priority for many countries and organizations, as it has the potential to foster economic growth, development, and global trade cooperation. The successful completion of the DDA would help achieve a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable trade system that benefits nations around the world.
