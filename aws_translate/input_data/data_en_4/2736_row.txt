[Question]Tanesha needs to buy rope so cut into 10 pieces that are each six inches long. She sees a 6-foot length of rope that cost $5 and also sees 1-foot lengths of rope that cost $1.25 each. What is the least she has to spend to get the rope she needs?
[Answer]She needs 60 inches of rope because 10 x 6 equals 60. The six - foot length of rope is 72 inches long because 6 x 12 = 72. The six - foot length of rope would give her 12 pieces because 72 / 6 = 12. The six - foot length is long enough because 12 > 10. Each 1 - foot rope equals 12 inches. She would need 5 of the 1 - foot ropes because 60 / 12 = 5. If she bought one - foot ropes it would cost $6.25 because 5 x 1.25 = 6.25. The cheapest rope to buy is the 6 - foot rope because 5 < 6.25. The answer is 5.

How many weeks can Patty go without doing chores by paying her siblings with cookies?
A: Patty can buy 5 packs of cookies because 15 / 3 = 5. Patty gets 120 cookies because 5 x 24 = 120. Patty would need to pay 12 cookies per week because 3 x 4 = 12. Patty can avoid 10 weeks of chores because 120 / 12 = 10. The answer is 10.

[Question]Mary, Jess, and Christina want to decorate a party room with balloons. Each person inflates balloons at different speeds, and they only have 30 minutes to inflate as many balloons as possible. Mary inflates 10 balloons per minute, Jess inflates 7 balloons per minute and Christina came 15 minutes late and was the slowest one inflating 4 balloons per minute. How many balloons can they inflate before running out of time?
[Answer]Mary will inflate a total of 10 balloons / minute x 30 minutes = 300 balloons. Jess will inflate a total of 7 balloons / minute x 30 minutes = 210 balloons. Christina will inflate a total of 4 balloons / minute x 15 minutes = 60 balloons. Combining all balloons, they made 300 balloons + 210 balloons + 60 balloons = 570 balloons. The answer is 570.
Q: Janet makes $20 per hour at work. She works 52 hours per week. Anything over 40 hours per week is considered overtime and is paid at 1.5 times the normal rate. She wants to purchase a $4640 car. How many weeks does she need to work to purchase the car?
A: Each week she makes $20 * 40 = $800 from her normal hours. For overtime she makes $20 * 1.5 = $30 per hour. Each week she works 52 - 40 = 12 overtime hours per week. She makes a total of 12 * $30 = $360 from overtime every week. This means she makes a total of $800 + $360 = $1160 per week. To reach $4640 she would need to work $4640 / $1160 = 4 weeks. The answer is 4.
