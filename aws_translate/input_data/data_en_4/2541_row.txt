This phrase may refer to the importance of networking, collaboration, and maintaining relationships among various stakeholders within the Danish business or innovation clusters. In the context of Denmark, these "cluster actors" could include organizations, companies, and institutions that contribute to the growth and development of the country's economy and various industries.

Being in close contact with these Danish cluster actors is essential for numerous reasons:

1. Knowledge sharing: One of the primary benefits of maintaining strong relationships with other cluster actors is the sharing of knowledge and expertise. This helps organizations improve their understanding of market trends, develop best practices, and find innovative solutions to pressing challenges.

2. Fostering innovation: Close collaboration between cluster actors encourages a culture of innovation and creativity. By pooling their resources and competencies, these organizations can work together to develop new technologies, products, or services that may be the key to unlocking new market opportunities.

3. Access to new markets: Close contact with other cluster actors can pave the way for new partnerships and business ventures, opening doors to new markets and customers. This can be especially important for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that lack the resources to directly enter international markets on their own.

4. Enhancing competitiveness: In today’s globalized world, maintaining the competitiveness of a country’s industries is crucial. By being in close contact with the Danish cluster actors, organizations can continuously adapt their strategies, business models, and solutions to meet the ever-changing demands of the global market.

These partnerships are vital for leveraging the strengths and resources of both the public and private sectors to drive economic development in Denmark.

6. Talent acquisition and retention: Danish cluster actors depend on a skilled workforce to support their operations and growth. Being in close contact with key industry stakeholders enables organizations to attract and retain top talent and ensure they have the right skills and expertise for their workforce needs.

7. Improved access to funding: Collaborating with other Danish cluster actors can not only help organizations leverage the expertise and resources of their peers but also improve their access to funding. This is because many funding opportunities are specifically targeted at collaborative projects or initiatives within industry clusters.

Indeed, being in close contact with the Danish cluster actors is crucial for organizations and businesses to thrive in a highly competitive and globalized market. By working together and sharing knowledge, expertise, and resources, these cluster actors can drive innovation, create new opportunities, and ensure Denmark's continued economic success.
