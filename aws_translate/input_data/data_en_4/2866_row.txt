The phrase "once in a blue moon" refers to an event or occurrence that is extremely rare. The idiom originates from the astronomical phenomenon of a "blue moon." Before delving into the origin and history of the expression, it is essential to understand the meaning and significance behind a blue moon itself.

The term "blue moon" is used to describe the second full moon that takes place within a single calendar month. To be clear, the moon does not actually turn blue. The color blue has no scientific connection to the event, and the term is simply a metaphor. It would typically require extraordinarily rare conditions, such as the presence of volcanic ash or large forest fires, for the moon to appear blue. Interestingly, there are other occasions when the term is used for different moon-related phenomena; however, the phrase "once in a blue moon" is etymologically tied to the aforementioned phenomenon of having two full moons in a single month.

Full moons usually occur nearly every 29.5 days, which is approximately the length of one lunar cycle. Given that most months in the Gregorian calendar have 30 or 31 days, the possibility of witnessing two full moons in a single month arises occasionally. This phenomenon only happens, on average, once every 2.7 years, thus making it an infrequent event and leading to the birth of the expression "once in a blue moon."

The history of the phrase can be traced back to English literature from the 16th century. The first known recorded use of the term "blue moon" appeared in a pamphlet from 1528, titled "Rede Me and Be Not Wrothe," authored by William Roy and Jeremy Barlowe. In this early usage, the term was not employed to describe an astronomical event but instead to exemplify the absurdity â€“ akin to saying, "when pigs fly." However, it is important to note that the connection between these early instances and the current idiomatic meaning is quite weak and not well-documented.

The phrase continued to evolve, and by the 19th century, it began to gain momentum and solidify its connection to rare lunar phenomena. In 1821, an article in The London Literary Gazette used the phrase to describe a rare event. The term became increasingly popular over time and established its correlation with the infrequent occurrence of two full moons within a single calendar month.

In more recent times, a publication called Sky & Telescope played a pivotal role in popularizing the phrase, albeit unintentionally. In an article from 1946, the author, James Hugh Pruett, misunderstood a definition within the 1937 edition of the Maine Farmers' Almanac. Pruett's misinterpretation led to the introduction of the "Blue Moon Rule," equating a blue moon to the second full moon within a single month. This article ultimately helped cement and propagate the modern understanding of a blue moon and subsequently, the origin of the phrase "once in a blue moon."

In summary, the idiom "once in a blue moon" signifies an event that happens very rarely. The expression has historical ties to rare lunar events and evolved over time, particularly due to a 1946 article that popularized Pruett's "Blue Moon Rule." Today, the term is used to describe any exceedingly uncommon occurrence or special event that only happens every few years.
