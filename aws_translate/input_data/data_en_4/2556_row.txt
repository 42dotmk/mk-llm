open about their relationship, and Mary becomes more comfortable with it as well. However, things take a turn when Tori's sister, Allison, visits the school and sees Paulie and Tori in an intimate moment. Afraid of how her family will react and the potential consequences of being exposed, Tori decides to distance herself from Paulie and begins dating Jake to convince her family, classmates, and herself that she is actually straight.

As Paulie's love for Tori remains intense and undimmed, her emotional state suffers greatly from Tori's rejection. She starts acting out in increasingly dangerous ways, fueled by both her anguish from the heartbreak and her passionate love for Tori. This includes challenging one of the boys from the nearby school to a fencing duel, resulting in her suspension from school.

During this time, Paulie continues to care for her wounded falcon, projecting her own feelings of pain and isolation onto the bird and finding solace in their shared loneliness. The falcon can be seen as a metaphor for both Paulie's character and the relationship between Paulie and Tori - fierce, wild, and beautiful, but also fragile and unable to fully heal from its wounds.

Mary becomes increasingly worried about Paulie as her mental health deteriorates, and she tries to offer support and help her friend regain a sense of stability. Meanwhile, Tori struggles with her feelings and identity but continues to date Jake to maintain appearances.

As tensions rise between all three girls, and Paulie's erratic behavior becomes more alarming, a confrontation occurs that leads to tragedy and heartbreak. Ultimately, "Lost and Delirious" serves as a poignant examination of the nature of love, the complexities of identity, societal pressures, and the trials and tribulations faced by young women navigating adolescence and forming their own identities.

To answer your question, while jogging, Paulie finds a wounded falcon, which she befriends and becomes obsessed with caring for it. She believes that something untoward has happened to its parents.
