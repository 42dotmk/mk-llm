Title: San Francisco Radio Stations Ban No. 1 Hit "Royals" Prior to World Series, While Kansas City Embraces the Tune

As the highly anticipated World Series kicks off, the rivalry between the San Francisco Giants and Kansas City Royals is not just limited to the field. In an amusing display of team spirit and competition, San Francisco radio stations have collectively decided to ban Lorde's chart-topping hit "Royals" from Bay Area airwaves for the duration of the series, while a station in Kansas City plans to put the song on heavy rotation during the first night of the showdown.

The Giants and Royals are set to face off in Game 1 of the World Series this Tuesday night, and listeners in San Francisco will notice a significant absence in the radio playlist. Bay Area stations have come together in agreement to remove the Grammy-winning song by New Zealand artist Lorde from their schedules as a way to show unwavering support for their home team.

The interesting fact behind the 2013 hit song is that Lorde was actually inspired by a photograph she saw of Kansas City Royals' then-retired baseball player George Brett in a magazine, signing autographs for fans. The image, which was accompanied by the word "Royals", became the central theme of the song that went on to become a No. 1 hit in multiple countries. Given the connection to the Kansas City team, it's not surprising that San Francisco stations have chosen to distance themselves from the track for the time being.

On the other side of the competition, Kansas City is embracing the tune wholeheartedly. A local radio station in Missouri's largest city announced that they would be putting "Royals" on heavy rotation throughout the first night of the World Series. This move is seen as a clever counter-response to the Bay Area's elimination of the song, and as a way of celebrating one of Kansas City's many claims to fame.

This humorous tit-for-tat between the radio stations adds an extra layer of rivalry to the already intense World Series atmosphere. Fans on both sides of the matchup are sure to appreciate the lengths their respective cities are going to demonstrate team loyalty and dedication.

As the World Series progresses, all eyes will be on the Giants and Royals, with their respective cities – and radio stations – standing firmly behind them. While it's unclear whether the temporary ban of "Royals" will have any noticeable psychological impact on the participating teams, it's a lighthearted and entertaining manifestation of the competitive spirit that makes baseball, and sports in general, such a thrilling experience for fans and players alike.

In summary, the World Series between the San Francisco Giants and Kansas City Royals brings not just fierce competition on the baseball field, but also an amusing battle between radio stations and fanbases. San Francisco's decision to ban Lorde's "Royals" from their airwaves shows a commitment to the home team, while Kansas City's equal and opposite reaction of putting the song on heavy rotation highlights the pride and joy of their city and baseball legacy. As the games unfold, this soundtrack switch-up leaves fans everywhere excited to see how their cities will continue to support their teams in creative and engaging ways.
