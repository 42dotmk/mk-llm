Question: A coffee shop brews 10 coffee cups per hour on a weekday and 120 coffee cups in total over the weekend. If the coffee shop is open 5 hours a day every single day, how many coffee cups are brewed in 1 week?
Answer: On a weekday, the shop produces 10 coffee cups per hour * 5 hours per weekday = 50 coffee cups. The coffee shop therefore brewed 50 coffee cups per day * 5 weekdays in a week = 250 coffee cups. So in total, the coffee shop brewed a total of 250 weekday coffee cups + 120 weekend coffee cups = 370 coffee cups in 1 week. The answer is 370.
[Question]Jenny is planning her catering budget for her wedding. She's going to have 80 guests. 3 times as many guests want steak as chicken. If each steak entree costs $25 and each chicken entree costs $18, how much is the total catering budget?
[Answer]Let s be the number of guests who want steak and c be the number who want chicken. We know that s + c = 80 and s = 3c. Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get 3c + c = 80. Combining like terms, we get 4c = 80. Dividing both sides by 4, we get c = 20. Then multiply the number of guests who want chicken by the cost of each chicken entree: 20 guests * $18 / guest = $360. Then triple the number of guests who want chicken to find the number who want steak: 20 guests * 3 = 60 guests. Then multiply the number of guests who want steak by the cost of each steak entree: 60 guests * $25 / guest = $1500. Then add the cost of the steak and chicken entrees to find the total cost: $1500 + $360 = $1860. The answer is 1860.
Q: Karen had the giant box of crayons, containing twice as many crayons as were in Beatrice's box. But Beatrice's box contained twice as many crayons as were in Gilbert's box of crayons. And Gilbert had four times as many crayons as were in Judah's box of crayons. If Karen's box contained 128 crayons, how many crayons were in Judah's box?
A: If Karen's 128 crayons were twice as many as were in Beatrice's box, there were 128 / 2 = 64 crayons in Beatrice's box. And since Beatrice's box contained twice as many crayons as were in Gilbert's box of crayons, then Gilbert had 64 / 2 = 32 crayons. And since Gilbert had four times as many crayons as Judah, then Judah had 32 / 4 = 8 crayons. The answer is 8.
Question: Monroe made 200 granola bars for her family. She and her husband ate 80, and the rest was divided equally among her children. If each child received 20 granola bars, how many children are in the family?
Answer: If Monroe and her husband ate 80 granola bars, then the number of granola bars the children shared is 200 - 80 = 120. Each child received 20 bars, and there were 120 granola bars, meaning there were 120 / 20 = 6 children in the family. The answer is 6.
