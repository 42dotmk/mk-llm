Q: Ryan is considering buying a new multivitamin brand. Each pill has 50 mg of Vitamin A in it. The recommended daily serving of Vitamin A is 200 mg. How many pills does Ryan need to hit the recommended amount for the week?
A: As the daily goal is 200mg and there are 7 days in a week, this means Ryan needs to take 7 * 200 = 1400mg in a week. As there is 50mg per pill, this means Ryan needs to take 1400 / 50 = 28 pills every week. The answer is 28.
Question: Jason bought a new bookcase that can hold a maximum of 80 pounds of weight. Jason has 70 hardcover books that each weigh half a pound, 30 textbooks that each weigh 2 pounds, and 3 knick-knacks that each weight 6 pounds. How many pounds over the bookcase's weight limit is this total collection of items?
Answer: First find the total weight of the hardcover books: 70 books * .5 pound / book = 35 pounds. Then find the total weight of the textbooks: 30 books * 2 pounds / book = 60 pounds. Then find the total weight of the knick - knacks: 3 knick - knacks * 6 pounds / knick - knack = 18 pounds. Then find the total weight of all the items: 35 pounds + 60 pounds + 18 pounds = 113 pounds. Then subtract the bookcase's weight limit: 113 pounds - 80 pounds = 33 pounds. The answer is 33.
[Question]Marlon had 30 female baby bunnies in his hutch. They matured after four months, and he gave 2/5 of them to his friend Rodney. If after another three months the bunnies conceived and gave birth to 2 kittens each, calculate the total number of bunnies Marlon has in his hutch now.
[Answer]When he gave Rodney 2 / 5 of the bunnies, he gave away 2 / 5 * 30 = 12 bunnies. He remained with 30 - 12 = 18 bunnies. When the bunnies gave birth to two kittens each, the total number of kittens born is 18 * 2 = 36. In total, Marlon now has 36 + 18 = 54 bunnies. The answer is 54.
Q: The spacecraft Gibraltar is a mountain-sized intergalactic vehicle for transporting equipment, building materials, and families to establish colonies on far-away planets. At full capacity, the vehicle can carry 300 family units with four people per family. The space flight is expected to take years, and it is expected that the size of families will grow during the space voyage. Therefore, when the spacecraft leaves the earth, it will carry 100 people less than one-third of the ship's capacity. How many people will be on the ship to start the journey?
A: The full capacity of the ship is 300 * 4 = 1200 people. One - third of capacity is 1200 / 3 = 400 people. 100 less than one - third capacity is 400 - 100 = 300 people. The answer is 300.
Question: A volcano erupts and spews ash into the sky. The ash cloud spreads out in a diameter eighteen times as far as the distance it shot up into the sky. If the ashes erupted three hundred feet into the sky, what was the radius of the ash cloud in feet?
Answer: The ash cloud spread out 300 * 18 = 5400 feet in diameter. The radius is half the diameter, so the ash cloud had a radius of 5400 / 2 = 2700 feet. The answer is 2700.
