BCS and push for a playoff system as the preferred method to determine college football's national champion. Proponents of the playoff system argue that it would create a more even playing field, offering teams from smaller conferences and schools a better chance to prove themselves and compete for the ultimate title. Critics of the BCS, including Obama himself, declared that the current system often leads to unfair outcomes, as it relies heavily on polls, computer rankings, and a myriad of other factors that do not necessarily reflect a team's true capabilities or achievements on the field.

Those in favor of maintaining the BCS argue that it helps preserve the longstanding tradition of college football bowl games, which often generate significant revenue for the participating schools and create exciting matchup opportunities for fans. Furthermore, proponents of the BCS suggest that it provides stability and predictability to the college football landscape by clearly specifying a set of criteria that teams must meet in order to qualify for one of the prestigious BCS bowl games.

However, the anti-BCS sentiment has gained significant traction over the years, leading to heated debates among politicians, sports figures, and fans alike. Advocates for change assert that the BCS system creates an oligarchy of power in college football, where only a select few schools and conferences benefit from the system's structure, leaving smaller and less prominent athletic programs perpetually disadvantaged.

Some of the suggested alternatives to the BCS include an eight or sixteen-team playoff, which would see the top teams in the nation compete in a single-elimination tournament to determine the national champion. In this model, the winning team would have to demonstrate their prowess and consistency on the field by defeating a series of challengers in head-to-head matchups, rather than relying on the subjective opinions and calculations that help shape BCS rankings.

While the playoff system has garnered widespread support, it has also encountered resistance from those who worry that it might dilute the significance and appeal of regular-season games. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the potential impact on student-athletes' educational commitments and the possibility of extending the season, which could lead to increased risk of player injuries.

In summary, the debate over the BCS system and the need for a playoff system in college football is one that is driven by differing opinions on what constitutes a fair and equitable means of determining a national champion. While the BCS has succeeded in generating revenue and maintaining certain aspects of college football tradition, it has also been criticized as an exclusive and flawed approach to evaluating a team's worthiness for championship contention. As public opinion continues to shift, it remains to be seen whether a playoff system will eventually be implemented, providing a chance for more schools to vie for the prestigious title of National Champion. Regardless of the ultimate outcome, it is clear that passionate college football fans, players, administrators, and even President-elect Obama will continue to fight for what they believe is the best path forward for the beloved sport.
