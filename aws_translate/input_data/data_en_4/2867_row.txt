Question: Of 96 oranges, half were ripe. If 1/4 of the ripe oranges were eaten and 1/8 of the unripe oranges were eaten, how many were left eaten in total?
Answer: There were 96 / 2 = 48 ripe oranges. 48 / 4 = 12 ripe oranges were eaten. 48 / 8 = 6 unripe oranges were eaten. There were 12 + 6 = 18 oranges eaten in total. There were 96 - 18 = 78 oranges left uneaten. The answer is 78.
[Question]Jamie and Oliver are planning to go on a vacation. A plane ticket costs $24 for each person and a hotel stay costs $12 for each person per day. How much money will they spend on the vacation if they stay for 3 days?
[Answer]Jamie and Oliver will spend $24 x 2 = $48 for the plane ticket. They will spend $12 x 2 = $24 for staying in the hotel per day.

Q: This weekend's football game matched the Seattle Seahawks with the Denver Broncos. The final score was 37-23, with the Seattle Seahawks taking the win. If a touchdown is worth 7 points and a field goal is worth 3 points, how many touchdowns did the Seattle Seahawks score if they scored 3 field goals during the game?
A: The Seattle Seahawks scored 3 field goals during the length of the game and each field goal is worth 3 points, so 3 * 3 = 9 points were made by the Seattle Seahawks from field goals. The Seattle Seahawks won so their total points would be 37 with 9 of those points accrued through the scoring of field goals, which makes 37 - 9 = 28 points left to be scored by touchdowns. There are 28 points scored by touchdowns and each touchdown is worth 7 points, so this means that 28 / 7 = 4 touchdowns were scored by the Seattle Seahawks throughout the game. The answer is 4.
Question: Three siblings are born 5 years apart, each. If the eldest child is 20 years old now, what's the total of the ages of the three siblings 10 years from now?
Answer: Ten years from now, the elder child will be 20 + 10 = 30 years old. If the elder child is 20 years old now, the second born is 20 - 5 = 15 years old, 5 years younger than the firstborn. The second - born will be 15 + 10 = 25 years old ten years from now. The total age of the first and second - born 10 years from now will be 25 + 30 = 55. The third - born who is five years younger than the second born is 15 - 5 = 10 years old. The third sibling's age ten years from now will be 10 + 10 = 20 years old. The total age of the three siblings ten years from now will be 55 + 20 = 75 years. The answer is 75.
