having to make the most gut-wrenching decision the world had ever forced upon him. Samuel had contracted a rare illness that had no known cure, which had stolen his health and his strength, reducing him to a pale shell of his former self. He suffered greatly, his tormented howls echoing deep into the night as he fought the lethal invader that had taken over his body. In the end, Samuel requested this; a peaceful end in the embrace of nature. He was ready, he said. And so, with a heavy heart, Hunter obliged.

The moon was high in the sky, a cold, indifferent witness to the heartbreaking scene unfolding beneath it. Hunter dug steadily, determination etching deep lines onto his tired face. Sweat dripped from his brow, staining the earth beneath him even as his hands clawed into the still soil. He picked a spot deep within the woods, next to a small serene pond. It was a place both loved, filled with memories of laughter and camaraderie; a place perfect for Samuel's final rest. The stars may have been bright above, but the darkness Hunter felt inside made them effectively invisble.

Hunter's every strike of his shovel seemed to echo endlessly, filling the silence of the night. Each mound of dirt represented a piece of his heart that was going with Samuel. By the time he was done, dawn was breaking, painting the sky in hues of pink and orange. With aching arms and an much more aching heart, Hunter lowered Samuel into the earth.

This hard and painful night was not only about the loss of Samuel, but also about the loss of a part of Hunter himself. Samuel had been more than a friend to Hunter, he had been his brother-in-spirit, his confidante, his rock in times of adversity. Their bond was deeper than blood and stronger than iron.

Guilt, regret, and an overwhelming sense of loss coursed through Hunter as he covered Samuel with the earth he'd so recently displaced. With his bare hands, he patted down the loose soil, his tears falling freely and disappearing into the dirt. He stayed at the grave until his sobs softened into a quiet lament, the sun rising higher into the sky.

Time held no meaning for Hunter as he finally rose to his feet, his body tired but his soul exhausted. He made a promise to his departed friend right there, telling Samuel that his spirit would live on through Hunter, promising to honor him in his deeds and actions. As the sun began to climb higher, he gathered his tools and turned to go, leaving the now tranquil site with one final whispered goodbye.

From that day forward, Samuel lived in Hunter's memory. He served as a powerful reminder of the unstoppable march of time, a sudden, brutal lesson about the frailty of life. But above all else, he represented love in its purest form - the kind that could risk itself for another's comfort, the kind that even death couldn't separate.

In truth, Hunter never really left the woods that day. A part of him remained, buried with Samuel. But the part that walked away was stronger, determined to honor Samuel's memory, determined to live a life incredible enough for two. The process of burying Samuel was tragic, painful, and lonely, but Hunter rose from it renewed, carrying the essence of Samuel within him. He could only hope it would be enough.
