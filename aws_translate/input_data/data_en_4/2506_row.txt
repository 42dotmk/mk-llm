[Question]Karen's students are about to take a standardized test. Karen gets a $500 bonus if their average score is above 75, plus an extra $10 bonus for every additional point the average score increases above 75. So far, Karen has graded 8 tests, and the average is 70. Given that each student can have a maximum score of 150, what combined score do the last two tests need to have for Karen to earn a $600 bonus?
[Answer]First subtract $500 from Karen's goal bonus amount to find how much she makes from the extra $10 / point bonus: $600 - $500 = $100. Then divide the extra bonus by the extra rate: $100 / $10 / point = 10 points. Then add the 10 extra points to the baseline 75 point goal to find the students' average test score: 10 points + 75 points = 85 points. Then added the 8 graded tests to the 2 ungraded tests to find the total number of tests: 2 tests + 8 tests = 10 tests. Then multiply the 85 point average by the number of tests to find the total number of points the students need to earn: 85 points / test * 10 tests = 850 points. Then multiply the current average by the current number of graded tests to find how many points have been earned so far: 70 points / test * 8 tests = 560 points. Then subtract the number of points earned from the number of points needed to find the combine score the last two tests need: 850 points - 560 points = 290 points. The answer is 290.
Q: John has a party and invites 30 people. Of the people he invited 20% didn't show up. 75% of the people who show up get steak and the rest get chicken. How many people ordered chicken?
A: There were 30 * .2 = 6 people who didn't show up. So 30 - 6 = 24 people showed up. Of the people who showed up, 24 * .75 = 18 got steak. So 24 - 18 = 6 got chicken. The answer is 6.
Question: Matt has 8 baseball cards worth $6 each. If he trades two of them to Jane in exchange for 3 $2 cards and 1 $9 card, how much profit does he make?
Answer: First find the value of the 2 cards Matt trades: $6 / card * 2 cards = $12. Then find the total value of the 3 $2 cards: 3 cards * $2 / card = $6. Then subtract the value of the cards Marcus gave up from the value of the cards he gained to find his profit: $9 + $6 - $12 = $3. The answer is 3.
[Question]Mandy has three $20 bills while Manny has two $50 bills. If both of them decide to exchange their bills for $10 bills, how many more $10 bills than Mandy will Manny have?
[Answer]Mandy has a total of $20 x 3 = $60. So, she will have $60 / $10 = 6 $10 bills. Manny has a total of $50 x 2 = $100. So, he will have $100 / $10 = 10 $10 bills. Hence, Manny has 10 - 6 = 4 more $10 bills than Mandy. The answer is 4.
Q: A school bought 20 cartons of pencils at the start of school. Pencils come in cartons of 10 boxes and each box costs $2. The school also bought 10 cartons of markers. A carton has 5 boxes and costs $4. How much did the school spend in all?
A: The school bought 20 x 10 = 200 boxes of pencils. The pencils cost 200 x $2 = $400. The school bought 10 x 5 = 50 boxes of markers. The markers cost 50 x $4 = $200. Thus, the school spent a total of $400 + $200 = $600. The answer is 600.
