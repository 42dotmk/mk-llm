[Question]Marvin and Tina were selling candy bars to help fund their class trip. The candy bars cost $2 each. Marvin sold 35 candy bars total. Tina sold three times the number of candy bars as Marvin. How much more money did Tina make for the class trip selling candy bars compared to Marvin?
[Answer]Marvin sold 35 candy bars at $2 each so 35 * 2 = $70 worth of candy. Tina sold three times the amount of candy so $70 * 3 = $210 worth of candy. If Tina sold $210 worth of candy and Marvin sold $70 in candy then 210 - 70 = $140 more sold than Marvin. The answer is 140.
Q: Charlie owns one flute, two horns, and a harp. Carli owns twice as many flutes as Charlie, half as many horns as Charlie, but no harps. What is the combined total number of musical instruments owned by Charlie and Carli?
A: Charlie owns one flute, two horns, and a harp for a total of 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 instruments. Twice as many flutes as Charlie is 2 * 1 = 2 flutes,. Half as many horns as Charlie is 2 / 2 = 1 horn. Thus, Carli owns 2 + 1 = 3 instruments. Therefore, the combined total number of musical instruments owned by Charlie and Carli is 4 + 3 = 7 instruments. The answer is 7.
Question: Holly wants to plant a wall of privacy trees along her fence line. Her fence is 25 yards long. At maturity, the trees she wants to plant will measure 1.5 feet wide. Right now, these trees are on sale for $8.00 apiece. How much will it cost her to plant a row of the trees to run the length of her fence?
Answer: 3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3 * 25 = 75 feet long. At maturity these trees will measure 1.5 feet and she needs them to run along her 75 - foot fence so she needs 75 / 1.5 = 50 trees. The trees cost $8.00 apiece and she needs 50 so 8 * 50 = $400.00 worth of trees. The answer is 400.
[Question]One US cup equals 250ml. Brian is making lasagna for himself, his wife, his two kids, his parents, and his wife's parents. The recipe requires 1/2 a cup of milk per serving. How many 1L cartons of milk does Brian need to buy if each person is expected to eat 2 servings?
[Answer]There will be a total of (1) Brian + (1) Brian's wife + (2) two kids + (2) Brian's parents + (2) Brian's in - laws = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 people eating. If 1 person eats 2 serving of lasagna then 8 people will eat 8 * 2 = 16 servings. If each serving requires 1 / 2 cup of milk then 16 servings require 16 * 1 / 2 cups = 8 cups of milk. If one cup of milk equals 250 ml, then 8 cups of milk equal 8 * 250 = 2000 ml of milk. 1L carton of milk equals 1000ml of milk, therefore Brian needs 2000 / 1000 = 2 cartons of 1L milk. The answer is 2.
Q: John climbs 3 staircases. The first staircase has 20 steps. The next has twice as many steps as the first. The final staircase has 10 fewer steps than the second one. Each step is 0.5 feet. How many feet did he climb?
