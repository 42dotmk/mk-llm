Q: Janet filmed a new movie that is 60% longer than her previous 2-hour long movie. Her previous movie cost $50 per minute to film, and the newest movie cost twice as much per minute to film as the previous movie. What was the total amount of money required to film Janet's entire newest film?
A: The first movie was 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. So this movie is 120 * .6 = 72 minutes longer. So this movie is 192 minutes. It also cost 50 * 2 = $100 per minute to film. So it cost 192 * 100 = $1920. The answer is 1920.
Question: Ginger is weaving mats out of colored straw. Each mat takes 20 red straws, 30 orange straws, and half as many green straws as orange straws. How many straws does she need to make 10 mats?
Answer: First find the number of green straws each mat needs: 30 orange straws / 2 orange straws / green straw = 15 green straws. Then find the total number of straws in each mat: 15 straws + 20 straws + 30 straws = 65 straws. Then multiply that number by the number of mats to find the total number of straws Ginger needs: 65 straws / mat * 10 mats = 650 straws. The answer is 650.
[Question]Maya wants to learn how to lift and right now she can only lift a fourth of what America can. America can lift 240 pounds. As Maya grows stronger, she can add 10 more pounds to what she previously could lift. America follows this and now she has hit her peak lift at 300 pounds. If Maya reaches her absolute peak and can lift half of what America can lift, how many more pounds can Maya lift now than when she started?
[Answer]Maya can lift 240 * 0.25 = 60 pounds. Gaining progress, she can lift up to 60 + 10 = 70 pounds. At her peak, she can lift 300 * 0.5 = 150 pounds. Maya's peak is 150 pounds - 60 pounds when she started = 90 more pounds than when she started. The answer is 90.
Q: Oula and Tona work for a delivery service company, supplying different parts of their state with milk products. They are paid $100 for each delivery made in a day. In a particular month, Oula made 96 deliveries while Tona made 3/4 times as many deliveries as Oula. Calculate their difference in pay that month.
A: Oula's earnings for that month are 96 * $100 = $9600. Tona made 3 / 4 * 96 = 72 deliveries that month. Tona's total earnings for that month are 72 * $100 = $7200. Their difference in pay is $9600 - $7200 = $2400. The answer is 2400.
Question: A teacher asked Adelaide, Ephraim, and Kolton to buy ducks and monitor their growth patterns and features for their science class. Adelaide bought twice the number of ducks that Ephraim bought, while Ephraim bought 45 fewer ducks than Kolton. If Adelaide bought 30 ducks, what's the average number of ducks the three bought?
Answer: If Adelaide bought 30 ducks, Ephraim bought 30 ducks / 2 = 15 ducks. Since Ephraim bought 45 fewer ducks than Kolton, Kolton bought 45 ducks + 15 ducks = 60 ducks. The total number of ducks the three bought is 60 ducks + 15 ducks + 30 ducks = 105 ducks. The average number of ducks each bought is 105 ducks / 3 people = 35 ducks / person. The answer is 35.
