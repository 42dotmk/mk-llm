Reasoning and answer: After paying off the cost of ingredients, Andrew has $400 - $100 = $300. Since half of the money goes to the homeless shelter, the shelter receives $300 / 2 = $150. After contributing some of his own money, Andrew donates $150 + $10 = $160 to the shelter.
The answer: 160

Question: Andrew holds a bake sale to fundraise for charity. The bake sale earns a total of $400. Andrew keeps $100 to cover the cost of ingredients.

If Nataly has 3 times as much money as Raquel, she has 3 * $40 = $120. Tom has 1 / 4 as much money as Nataly, so he has 1 / 4 * $120 = $30. Combined, the three have $30 + $120 + $40 = $190.
The answer: 190
Reverse engineering the question: Tom has a quarter as much money as Nataly. Nataly has three times as much money as Raquel. How much money do Tom, Raquel, and Nataly have combined if Raquel has $40?

Reasoning and answer: The cost for 101 Kindergarten shirts x $5.80 = $585.80. The cost for 113 first grade shirts x $5 = $565. The cost for 107 second grade shirts x $5.60 = $599.20. The cost for 108 third grade shirts x $5.25 = $567. The total cost of the shirts was $585.80 + $565 + $599.20 + $567 = $2,317.
The answer: 2317

In the past four months, not including today, Erica has 80 kg * $20 / kg = $1600 worth of fish. Today, Erica trawled 80 * 2 = 160 kg of fish. Thus today's earnings are 160 kg * $20 / kg = $3200. Her total earnings are $3200 + $1600 = $4800.
The answer: 4800
Reverse engineering the question: Erica lives near a lake where most locals sell fish as their main source of income, earning $20 per kg of fish. She goes out fishing today and catches twice as many fish as she caught in total in the past four months. If Erica trawled 80 kg of fish in the past four months, not including today, how much money will she have earned in the past four months including today (assuming she sells all her fish)?
