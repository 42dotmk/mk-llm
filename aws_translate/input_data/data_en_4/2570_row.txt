Yes, it is possible to brew beer from start to finish in the month of September, assuming you have all the necessary equipment, ingredients, and an understanding of the brewing process. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Gather equipment: You'll need a brewing kettle, fermenter, airlock, sanitizer, hydrometer, thermometer, stirring spoon, siphon, bottles, and bottle caps.

2. Gather ingredients: Obtain malt extract, hops, yeast, and water. You may also choose to use additional grains, sugars, or flavorings depending on the type of beer you're brewing.

3. Sanitize: Clean and sanitize all equipment that will come into contact with the beer. This is crucial to prevent contamination and off-flavors.

4. Boil water and malt extract: Bring a large volume of water to a boil in your brewing kettle and then add the malt extract, stirring to dissolve it completely.

5. Add hops: Hops provide bitterness, flavor, and aroma to the beer. They are added at different times during the boil depending on their intended purpose. Typically, hops added at the beginning of the boil contribute more to bitterness, while those added towards the end contribute more to flavor and aroma.

6. Cool the wort: After boiling for approximately 60 minutes, the mixture (called wort) needs to be cooled as quickly as possible to a temperature suitable for yeast, typically around 65-75째F (18-24째C). You can use an immersion chiller, ice bath, or other cooling methods.

7. Transfer wort to fermenter: Siphon or pour the cooled wort into your sanitized fermenter, leaving behind any sediment (trub) in the kettle.

8. Pitch yeast: Add the yeast to the cooled wort, following the manufacturer's instructions for rehydration or direct pitching.

9. Attach airlock: Seal the fermenter and attach the sanitized airlock, which allows CO2 to escape without allowing contaminants to enter.

10. Fermentation: Store the fermenter in a cool, dark place with a stable temperature, ideally between 65-75째F (18-24째C). Fermentation usually takes 1-2 weeks, depending on the yeast strain and temperature.

11. Secondary fermentation (optional): Some brewers transfer the beer to a secondary fermenter after primary fermentation is complete to allow for further clarification and conditioning. This step is not necessary for all beers.

12. Measure final gravity: Use your sanitized hydrometer to measure the final gravity of the beer. This reading, along with the original gravity reading taken before fermentation, can be used to calculate the alcohol content of your beer.

13. Bottle: After fermentation is complete, siphon the beer into sanitized bottles, leaving behind any sediment in the fermenter. Add priming sugar to each bottle to carbonate the beer during bottle conditioning.

14. Cap and condition: Seal the bottles with sanitized caps and store them in a cool, dark place for 2-3 weeks to allow the beer to carbonate and mature.

15. Refrigerate and enjoy: Once your beer has conditioned, refrigerate it for 24-48 hours to settle any remaining sediment. Enjoy your homebrewed beer!

Given that the fermentation process takes about 1-2 weeks and bottle conditioning takes an additional 2-3 weeks, brewing beer from start to finish should be possible within the month of September.
