Q: Jean is trying to motivate herself to write her final paper. She eats one donut per 2 pages that she writes. If she writes 12 pages and each donut has 150 calories, how many calories does she eat?
A: First find the total number of donuts Jean eats: 12 pages / 2 pages / donut = 6 donuts. Then multiply that number by the number of calories per donut to find the total number of calories she eats: 6 donuts * 150 calories / donut = 900 calories. The answer is 900.
Question: Mary just held tryouts for the high school band. 80% of the 20 flutes got in, half the 30 clarinets got in, 1/3 of the 60 trumpets got in, and 1/10th of the 20 pianists got in. How many people are in the band total?
Answer: First find the total number of flutes who were accepted: 20 flutes * .8 = 16 flutes. Then find the total number of clarinets who were accepted: 30 clarinets * .5 = 15 clarinets. Then find the total number of trumpets who were accepted: 60 trumpets * 1 / 3 = 20 trumpets. Then find the total number of pianists who were accepted: 20 pianists * 1 / 10 = 2 pianists. Then add the number of each kind of instrument to find the total number of people in the band: 16 flutes + 15 clarinets + 20 trumpets + 2 pianists = 53 people. The answer is 53.
[Question]Burt spent $2.00 on a packet of basil seeds and $8.00 on potting soil. The packet of seeds yielded 20 basil plants. He sells each basil plant for $5.00 at the local farmer's market. What is the net profit from his basil plants?
[Answer]He spent $2.00 on seeds and $8.00 on soil for a total of 2 + 8 = $10.00. He sells each of the 20 basil plants for $5.00 so he makes 20 * 5 = $100.00. He made $100.00 from selling basil plants and he spent $10.00 to buy and grow the seeds. His net profit is 100 - 10 = $90.00. The answer is 90.
Q: A pair of dogs are barking back and forth at each other from across the street. The poodle barks twice for every one time the terrier barks. The terrier’s owner hushes it every second time it barks. She has to say “hush” six times before the dogs stopped barking. How many times did the poodle bark?
A: The terrier barked twice as many times as it was told to hush, so it barked 6 * 2 = 12 times. The poodle barked two times for every terrier bark, so it barked 12 * 2 = 24 times. The answer is 24.
Question: Connie is trying to remember when her grandmother was born. She knows her grandmother's older brother was born in 1932, her older sister was born in 1936, and the gap between her grandmother and her sister is twice the gap between the older brother and the older sister. What year was Connie's grandma born?
Answer: First find the age gap between the older brother and sister by subtracting the earlier birth year from the later: 1936 - 1932 = 4 years. Then double the age gap to find how many years passed between the sister's birth and the grandmother's: 4 years * 2 = 8 years. Then add 8 years to the older sister's birth year to find the grandmother's birth year: 1936 + 8 = 1944. The answer is 1944.
