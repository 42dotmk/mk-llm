Orr is set to officially start his role on March 25th, but has already expressed that he plans to consider all options in his efforts to revitalize the strapped city.

Step 1: Analyzing the Situation
Kevyn Orr's first challenge in saving Detroit will be to analyze the state of the city's finances and develop a comprehensive understanding of its debts and obligations. This will involve a thorough examination of the city's financial records, consulting with various stakeholders, and identifying key areas of concern.

This will involve collaborating with city officials to determine how best to allocate resources and prioritize projects, as well as coordinating with various governmental and non-governmental organizations to ensure a smooth implementation process. A transparent and accountable system of monitoring and evaluation will be crucial to understanding the impact and success of these changes.
