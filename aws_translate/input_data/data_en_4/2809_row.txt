[Question]James wants to learn to become a chess grandmaster. It takes 2 hours to learn the rules. It then takes him 49 times that long to get a level of proficiency to start playing in local tournaments. After that, he devotes his life to chess and spends 100 times as much as the combined time to get proficient to becoming a master. How much total time did he spend?
[Answer]It takes him 2 * 49 = 98 hours to go from knowing how to play to proficient. So he spends 98 + 2 = 100 hours combined on those. So it takes him 100 * 100 = 10,000 hours to become a master from proficient. So the total time was 100 + 10000 = 10,100 hours. The answer is 10100.
Q: A fan can create an airflow of 10 liters per second. If the fan works for 10 minutes each day, calculate the amount of airflow it will create in one week.
A: If the fan works for 10 minutes each day, in a week with 7 days, it will have worked for 10 * 7 = 70 minutes. Since a minute has 60 seconds, the total time in seconds that the fan will have worked in one week is 70 * 60 = 4200 seconds. Since the fan can create an airflow of 10 liters per second, in 4200 seconds, it will create an airflow of 4200 * 10 = 42000 liters. The answer is 42000.
Question: Carter has a jar with 20 green M&Ms and 20 red M&Ms. He eats 12 of the green M&Ms, then his sister comes and eats half the red M&Ms and adds 14 yellow M&Ms. If Carter picks an M&M at random now, what is the percentage chance he'll get a green M&M?
Answer: First find the final number of green M&Ms by subtracting 12 from the starting number: 20 M&Ms - 12 M&Ms = 8 green M&Ms. Then find the final number of red M&Ms by dividing the starting number by half: 20 M&Ms / 2 = 10 red M&Ms. Then find the total number of M&Ms at the end by adding the number of red, green and yellow M&Ms: 8 M&Ms + 10 M&Ms + 14 M&Ms = 32 M&Ms. Then divide the number of green M&Ms by the total number of M&Ms and multiply by 100 to find the percentage chance Carter gets a green M&M: 8 M&Ms / 32 M&Ms * 100 = 25%. The answer is 25.
[Question]In Mary's class, there are 25 students. Their teacher told them they could pay $50 each to finance a big science project that they and their society would benefit greatly from. They all paid the full amount except for 4 students, who paid half. How much was the class able to gather together?
[Answer]The original amount is $50 so half is $50 / 2 = $25. 4 students paid half ($25) for a total of 4 * $25 = $100. There are 25 - 4 = 21 students left. 21 students paid the full amount ($50) for a total of 21 * $50 = $1050. They were able to gather a total of $100 + $1050 = $1150. The answer is 1150.
Q: Davante has twice as many friends as there are days in the week. 3 of his friends are girls. How many friends does he have that are boys?
A: Davante has 14 friends because 2 times 7 equals 14. Davante has 11 friends who are boys because 14 - 3 equals 11. The answer is 11.
Question: A lot of people have been sick at Gary's workplace, so he's been working a lot of extra shifts to fill in for people. As a result, he's earned some overtime (where every hour after 40 he earns 1.5 times his normal wage.) His paycheck (before taxes are taken out) came out to $696. If Gary normally earns $12 per hour, how many hours did he work that week?
Answer:
