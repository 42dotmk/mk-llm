[Question]Mr. Banks and Ms. Elizabeth are entrepreneurs who invest in different income streams and earn revenue from the investments. From each of his eight investments, Mr. Banks received $500 in revenue. Ms. Elizabeth also received $900 from each of her 5 investment streams. How much more money did Ms. Elizabeth make from her investments than Mr. Banks?
[Answer]Since Mr. Banks had 8 investment streams and each brought in a revenue of $500, he earned 500 * 8 = $4000 from all of his investments. Ms Elizabeth also received $900 * 5 = $4500 in revenue from her 5 income streams,. The total amount of money that Ms. Elizabeth made more than Mr. Banks is $4500 - $4000 = $500. The answer is 500.
Q: Peter has four horses. Each one eats 4 pounds of oats, twice a day, and 3 pounds of grain once a day. How many pounds of food does he need to feed his horses for 3 days?
A: Peter needs 2 * 4 pounds of oats = 8 pounds of oats per horse per day. Peter will need 8 pounds oats * 3 days = 24 pounds of oats per horse. Peter will need 24 pounds of oats * 4 horses = 96 pounds of oats total. Peter needs 3 pounds of grain * 3 days per horse = 9 pounds of grain per horse. Peter will need 9 pounds of grain * 4 horses = 36 pounds of grain total. For 3 days Peter will need a total of 96 pounds oats + 36 pounds grain = 132 pounds total. The answer is 132.
Question: Eliza has 4 siblings. The total height of all 5 siblings combined is 330 inches. Two of her siblings are both 66 inches tall. Another sibling is 60 inches tall. If Eliza is 2 inches shorter than the last sibling, how tall is Eliza?
Answer: The first three siblings are 66 + 66 + 60 = 192 inches tall. Since the total of all the siblings is 330 inches, Eliza and the last sibling are 330 - 192 = 138 inches tall combined. If Eliza's height = h, 138 inches = h + (h + 2). (138 - 2) / 2 = 68 inches. Eliza is 68 inches tall. The answer is 68.
[Question]Every room in a building has at least two windows and a maximum of 4 windows. There are 122 windows total. If 5 rooms have 4 windows and 8 rooms have 3 windows, how many rooms in the building have 2 windows?
[Answer]Since 5 rooms have 4 windows, this accounts for 20 windows because 4 * 5 = 20 windows. Since 8 rooms have 3 windows, this accounts for 24 windows because 8 * 3 = 24 windows. There are 78 windows left over because 122 - 20 - 24 = 78. Therefore, there are 39 rooms with 2 windows because 78 / 2 = 39. The answer is 39.
Q: An opera house has 150 rows; each row has ten seats. The ticket costs $10 per show. How much did the opera house earn from one of the shows if 20% of the seats were not taken?
A: The opera house has 150 x 10 = 1500 seats. There are 1500 x 20 / 100 = 300 seats that were not taken. The total number of seats taken was 1500 - 300 = 1200. Therefore, the opera house earned $10 x 1200 = $12000 from one of the shows. The answer is 12000.
