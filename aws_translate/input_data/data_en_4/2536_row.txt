Question: Jill likes to watch shows on her favorite streaming service. She watched a show that was 30 minutes long, and then watched another show that was 4 times longer. How many total minutes did she spend watching shows?
Answer: Jill watched one show that was 4 times longer than 30 minutes, so it was 4 * 30 = 120 minutes long. Jill also watched another show that was 30 minutes long, so the total time Jill spent was 120 + 30 = 150 minutes. The answer is 150.
[Question]If Pete read twice as many books as Matt did last year, and this year he doubles that number while Matt reads only 50% more, how many books does Pete read across both years if Matt read 75 books in his second year?
[Answer]First, we need to find the amount Matt read both years to establish what Pete read, so to find Matt's first - year total we multiply 75 / 1.5 = 50 books the previous year. Since Pete read twice as many books as Matt did in the first year, and Matt's first - year total is 50, this means Pete read 50 * 2 = 100 books his first year. Since Pete doubled the number of books he read the following year, this means Pete read 100 * 2 = 200 books the following year. We add the two years of Pete's reading together to find 200 + 100 = 300 books read in total. The answer is 300.
Q: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?
A: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has. x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has. The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66. Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 29, so Corey has 29 candies. The answer is 29.
Question: The chicken crossed the road to get to the other side twice for the thrill of it. The first time, it had to dodge 23 speeding cars. The second time, a person tried to catch it and accidentally pulled out twice as many feathers as the number of cars the chicken had dodged. The chicken had 5263 feathers before its thrill-seeking road crossings. How many feathers did it have afterward?
Answer: The chicken lost 23 * 2 = 46 feathers on its second road crossing. Thus, it had 5263 - 46 = 5217 feathers after crossing the road twice. The answer is 5217.
[Question]Mary was working on a research paper and already had borrowed 5 books from the library. 3 books weren't helpful so she returned those and checked out 5 more books. 3 days later, she went back to the library and returned 2 of those books and checked out 7 more books. How many books does Mary currently have checked out of the library?
[Answer]Mary started with 5 books and returned 3 so she had 5 - 3 = 2 books. She had 2 books and checked out 5 more books so she had 2 + 5 = 7 books. She now has 7 books but returned 2 so she has 7 - 2 = 5 books. She had 5 books and checked out 7 more books so she has 5 + 7 = 12 books checked out. The answer is 12.
