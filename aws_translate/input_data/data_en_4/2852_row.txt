[Question]There are enough provisions in a castle to feed 300 people for 90 days. After 30 days, 100 people leave the castle. How many more days are left until all the food runs out?
[Answer]After 30 days, there will be enough food left to sustain 300 people for 90 days – 30 days = 60 days. After the 100 people leave, there will be 300 - 100 = 200 people left. The 200 people will eat 200 / 300 = 2 / 3 as much food as the original group of people in the castle. The 60 days' worth of food will last this smaller group for 60 days / (2 / 3) = 90 more days. The answer is 90.
Q: James has an old printer that crumples every seventh page and blurs the ink on every third page. If he prints 42 pages, how many are neither crumpled or blurred?
A: First find the total number of pages that are crumpled: 42 pages / 7 = 6 pages. Then find the total number of pages that are blurred: 42 pages / 3 = 14 pages. Then find the number of pages that are both blurred and crumpled by finding how many numbers are less or equal to 42 and divisible by both 3 and 7: there are two, 21 and 42. Then subtract the number of crumpled and blurred pages from the total number of pages, and add the number of pages that were double - counted because they were both blurred and crumpled: 42 pages - 6 pages - 14 pages + 2 pages = 24 pages. The answer is 24.
Question: Maria wants to buy a brand new bike. The retail price at the bike shop stands at $600. She saved $120 toward the purchase. As this was not enough, she asked her mother to give her the remaining amount. Her mother offered her $250 and told her that she needs to earn the rest working during the holidays. How much money must Maria earn to be able to buy the bike she wants?
Answer: Maria has $120 and received $250 from her mother. So she has 120 + 250 = $370. As the price of the bike stands at $600, Maria needs 600 – 370 = $230 more to buy the bike. The answer is 230.
[Question]Silvia wants to buy a new guitar online. The price of the guitar has a suggested retail price of $1000. Guitar Center has a special deal of 15% off but has a shipping fee of $100. Sweetwater has a 10% off deal with free shipping. How much will she save by buying from the cheaper store compared to the other store?
[Answer]The discount saved when buying from Guitar Center would be $1000 * 15% = $150. The total cost when buying from Guitar Center would be $1000 - $150 discount + $100 shipping = $950. The discount when buying from Sweetwater would be $1000 * 10% = $100. The total cost when buying from Sweetwater would be $1000 - $100 discount + $0 shipping = $900. Thus, Silvia would save $950 - $900 = $50 when buying from Sweetwater. The answer is 50.
Q: Olga has an aquarium with fish in 5 different colors. There are 12 yellow ones, half as many blue ones, and twice as many green ones as yellow ones. How many fish does Olga have in her aquarium?
A: Olga has half as many blue fish as yellow ones, which means 12 * 0.5 = 6 blue fish. Green fish are twice as many as yellow ones, so in total there are 12 * 2 = 24 green fish. So all the fish sum up to 12 + 6 + 24 = 42. The answer is 42.
