The Admiral's Men, also known as the "Earl of Nottingham's Men" after their patron Charles Howard, Earl of Nottingham, was a prominent and influential acting company during the English Renaissance period. They had a significant impact on the development and growth of English theatre, performing professional dramas for the entertainment of both public and court audiences, spanning from the late 16th century to the early 17th century.

The main occupation of The Admiral's Men was that of actors, stage performers, and theatre professionals who entertained the public by presenting plays and other theatrical productions. In addition to actors, the company would also consist of playwrights, technicians, stagehands, and managers to organize and facilitate the performances. Members of the company were responsible for developing and presenting new works, as well as reviving and reinterpreting classic plays from previous generations.

As one of the leading acting companies of the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras, The Admiral's Men contributed immensely to the artistic and cultural growth of English theatre. They performed at various playhouses around London, including The Theatre, The Rose, and the Fortune Theatre. Their work as theatre professionals included outdoor performances at amphitheatres, indoor performances at court, and private performances across the country for aristocracy and gentry.

The Admiral's Men were known for their close collaboration with some of the most talented playwrights and other theatre practitioners of the era. This includes renowned dramatist and playwright Christopher Marlowe, who penned popular plays like "Doctor Faustus," "Tamburlaine the Great," and "The Jew of Malta." In fact, The Admiral's Men premiered several plays penned by Marlowe, right up until his untimely demise in 1593. After Marlowe's passing, they continued to work with other notable playwrights, such as Robert Greene, Thomas Nashe, and later on, Thomas Heywood.

Another remarkable aspect of their occupation was the fostering of managerial and organizational developments within the theatre industry. The Admiral's Men were pioneers in establishing permanent acting companies, having their own playhouses, and developing long-term relationships with playwrights. This was an innovative departure from the previous model of temporary acting troupes who would come together to stage a few plays and then disband.

Apart from presenting popular entertainments, The Admiral's Men were also involved in influencing people's perception of society and politics, as many of their plays contained social and political commentary. They functioned not just as actors but as active contributors to the intellectual and cultural landscape of Renaissance England.

In conclusion, the occupation of The Admiral's Men encompassed a broad range of creative and logistical roles within the English theatre industry. They were actors, stage performers, theatre professionals, and influential visionaries who shaped the landscape of theatre during the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras. Their work, in conjunction with that of various playwrights and theatrical collaborators, enriched the cultural fabric of English society and left an indelible mark on the history of English drama.
