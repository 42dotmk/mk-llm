Lukangol, which had also suffered heavy damage during the attack by the rival tribe, was slowly beginning to recover as well. With the South Sudanese government's intervention, the attack by the Lou Nuer tribe was finally put to a stop. The arrival of army and police reinforcements, as well as the UN peacekeepers, served to quell the violence and establish a temporary sense of stability in the region.

The United Nations became heavily involved in peacekeeping efforts, working closely with the South Sudanese government to help restore order and mediate between the feuding tribes. The UN sought to address the underlying grievances and tensions between the Lou Nuer and the Murle peoples to prevent future conflicts.

As residents began to return to their devastated towns, humanitarian aid organizations rushed to offer assistance. International NGOs collaborated with local groups to provide much-needed food, water, shelter, and medical supplies to the affected communities. South Sudan's government made significant investments to rebuild infrastructure and restore essential services.

Recognizing that the attack on Pibor was part of a larger issue – the ongoing ethnic conflict between the Lou Nuer and Murle tribes – both tribes agreed to participate in peace talks facilitated by the government and UN mediators. These talks resulted in a fragile but meaningful ceasefire agreement. The leaders of both tribes committed to working together to address the long-standing disputes over land and resources that were the root causes of their conflict.

Well-aware that the peace process would be fraught with challenges, international organizations continued to provide support, funding, and resources to help the South Sudanese government and tribal leaders navigate complex negotiations. The ceasefire seemed to hold, and the situation in the town of Pibor, as well as its surrounding areas, gradually improved.

Over the next few years, the international community, including NGOs and foreign governments, strongly encouraged and supported a regional development plan. This plan focused on investing in education, healthcare, agriculture, and infrastructure, to foster long-term peace and development in the region. Efforts were made to encourage economic diversification and empower local communities to become more resilient and self-sufficient.

The gradual restoration of trust between the Lou Nuer and Murle tribes was crucial to stability in the area. Both sides had to learn to forgive the past and be open to a new chapter of collaboration and coexistence. This was not an easy process, and there were instances of setbacks and minor skirmishes. However, the strong commitment to peace by the tribal leaders and the support from the South Sudanese government and international community ultimately led to tangible progress and healing.

In the years that followed the attack on Pibor, both tribes continued to work on their relationship and contribute to rebuilding and development efforts. Trust was slowly established through collective initiatives geared toward the well-being of the whole region, transcending the ethnic tensions of the past. The story of Pibor serves as a reminder of the power of reconciliation, understanding, and unity in overcoming hate and violence.
