Question: Lucille has to divide the revenue from her business in the ratio of 4:11 for employee salaries and stock purchases, respectively. If she has $3000 as her revenue, calculate the total amount of money she spends on employee salary?
Answer: The total ratio representing the revenue Lucille has is 4 + 11 = 15. The value from the ratio representing employee salary is 4 / 15, and this is 4 / 15 * $3000 = $800 that Lucille has to pay her employees. The answer is 800.
[Question]Grace is looking to plant some lettuce in her raised bed garden. Her raised bed is comprised of 2 large beds on top with 2 medium beds on the bottom. The top bed can hold 4 rows of lettuce with 25 seeds being sown per row. The medium bed can house 3 rows with 20 seeds being sown per row. How many seeds can Grace plant in all four beds of her raised bed garden?
[Answer]A large bed can hold 4 rows with 25 seeds per row, 4 * 25 = 100 seeds per large bed. 100 seeds per large bed and there are 2 beds, 100 * 2 = 200 seeds needed in total for both large beds. A medium bed can hold 3 rows with 20 seeds sown per row, 3 * 20 = 60 seeds per medium bed. 60 seeds per medium bed and there are 2 medium beds, 60 * 2 = 120 seeds needed in total for both medium beds. 200 seeds needed for the large beds combined with 120 seeds needed for the medium beds comes to 200 + 120 = 320 seeds needed to plant all four beds of the raised garden bed. The answer is 320.
Q: Marla has to spend 20 minutes driving one way to her son's school, then 70 minutes attending parent-teacher night, then the same amount of time driving home. How many minutes does Marla spend on this errand in total?
A: First multiply Marla's one - way driving time by 2 to find her total driving time: 20 minutes * 2 = 40 minutes. Then add Marla's driving time to the time spent attending the conference to find the total time: 70 minutes + 40 minutes = 110 minutes. The answer is 110.
Question: Betty and Dora started making some cupcakes at the same time. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour and Dora makes 8 every hour. If Betty took a two-hour break, what is the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours?
Answer: Dora made 8 cupcakes per hour for 5 hours for a total of 8 * 5 = 40 cupcakes. Betty took a 2 - hour break so she spent 5 - 2 = 3 hours making cupcakes. Betty made 10 cupcakes per hour for 3 hours for a total of 10 * 3 = 30 cupcakes. The difference between the number of cupcakes they made is 40 - 30 = 10 cupcakes. The answer is 10.
[Question]Lisa makes breakfast for her family every morning, Monday through Friday. She makes 2 eggs for each of her 4 children and 3 eggs for her husband. Then, she makes 2 eggs for herself. How many eggs does Lisa cook for her family for breakfast in a year?
[Answer]Lisa makes 2 eggs / child x 4 children = 8 eggs for her children. She makes 3 eggs for her husband + 2 for herself + 8 for her children = 13 eggs. Lisa makes breakfast 5 days a week for 52 weeks a year, so 5 * 52 = 260 breakfasts. So Lisa makes 13 eggs / breakfast x 260 breakfasts = 3,380 eggs. The answer is 3380.
