Chris Gimenez's career-high 4 RBIs lead Indians to 15-4 victory over Royals

CLEVELAND â€“ Chris Gimenez drove in a career-high four runs and the Cleveland Indians hit a trio of three-run homers to beat the Kansas City Royals 15-4 Friday night.

Matt LaPorta hit a three-run homer in Cleveland's six-run second inning off Bryan Bullington (1-3). Gimenez and Jayson Nix later connected with two on against relievers in the Indians' largest offensive output since a 15-3 win over Oakland on July 3, 2009.

Josh Tomlin (2-3) won for the first time in five starts since beating the New York Yankees in his major league debut July 27. The right-hander allowed three runs and eight hits over five innings.

Jason Donald tied a career high with four hits as Cleveland earned its first consecutive wins since taking three in a row July 31 to Aug. 2.

The Indians have lost 13 of 18 and trail the fourth-place Royals by two games in the AL Central.

The Royals' Gregor Blanco had four hits for the fourth time in his career, but manager Ned Yost failed to get career win No. 500. He is 499-553 with Milwaukee and Kansas City, going 42-51 since replacing Trey Hillman on May 14.

Bullington gave up seven runs and nine hits over four innings in his second straight poor start after beating the Yankees 1-0 on two hits Aug. 15 for his first career win. The No. 1 overall draft pick in 2002 by Pittsburgh has played with four teams including Cleveland in parts of five seasons.

The right-hander gave up 11 hits and six runs over five innings Saturday to the Chicago White Sox. He retired Cleveland in order in the first inning, then made 40 pitches in the second, when the Indians totaled seven hits. They had hit only .151 (34 for 225) with seven runs while going 1-5 in six previous games.

LaPorta's homer was his second in two games and ninth overall. Gimenez had an RBI double and scored on a single by Michael Brantley to make it 5-0. Brantley stole second and scored on a two-out single by Shin-Soo Choo.

Wilson Betemit led off the Royals' fourth with his ninth homer. Yuniesky Betancourt and Blanco added run-scoring singles later in the inning to make it 6-3.

Nix doubled home Choo, who had doubled, to put Cleveland up 7-3 in the bottom half.

Tomlin walked a career-high four and struck out only one, but showed improvement after losing three straight starts with a 5.50 ERA.
