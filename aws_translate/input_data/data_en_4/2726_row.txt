[Question]Wally gives 3/4 of his 400 tickets to his two friends Jensen and Finley, who share the tickets in a ratio of 4:11. How many tickets does Finley get?
[Answer]Wally gives his friends 3 / 4 * 400 = 300 tickets to share. The total ratio that represents the tickets that Jensen and Finley share is 4 + 11 = 15. From the total ratio, the fraction that represents the share that Finley got is 11 / 15, and since he shared with Jensen 300 tickets, he got 11 / 15 * 300 = 220 tickets. The answer is 220.
Q: Monica and Sheila are twins. Their mother gave them $50 and told them to buy some toilet paper and spend the remainder on groceries. The toilet paper cost $12. They bought apples, butter, eggs, and a large ham for twice the cost of the toilet paper. Since they still had some leftover money, they called their mother and she gave them permission to buy whatever they wanted for themselves as long as they shared the money evenly. They saw some boots they really liked, but a pair of boots costs 3 times the amount they had left. How much more would Monica and Sheila each have to add of their own money to buy two pairs of boots?
A: The groceries cost $12 x 2 = $24. Including the toilet paper, Monica and Sheila had already spent $12 + $24 = $36. This means that they had $50 - $36 = $14 left to spend on themselves. However, the boots cost $14 x 3 = $42 per pair. Two pairs of boots would cost $42 x 2 = $84. They need another $84 - $14 = $70 to buy two pairs. Each of them needs to add another $70 / 2 = $35. The answer is 35.
Question: Tommy ordered a total weight of 10 kilograms of apple, orange, grape, and strawberry fruits. He ordered 3 kilograms of apples, 1 kilogram of orange, and 3 kilograms of grapes. How many kilograms of strawberries did he order?

[Question]Mrs. Gable’s third grade class is on a field trip to the beach. For lunch, Mrs. Gable brought 20 lunches for the 20 students in her class. She included a pack of animal crackers in each lunch bag for dessert. Each pack of animal crackers contained 10 animal crackers. If 2 students did not eat their animal crackers, how many animal crackers were eaten in total among Mrs. Gable’s students?
[Answer]Since 2 students did not eat their animal crackers, 20 - 2 = 18 students ate their animal crackers. The students ate a total of 18 * 10 = 180 animal crackers. The answer is 180.
Q: John decides to get a new apartment with a roommate. His former rent was $2 per square foot for a 750 square foot apartment. His new apartment cost $2800 per month, which he splits evenly with the roommate. How much money does he save a year?
A: His old apartment cost 750 * $2 = $1500 a month. His new apartment cost $2800 / 2 = $1400 a month. So he saves $1500 - $1400 = $100 a month. That means he saves $100 * 12 = $1200 a year. The answer is 1200.
