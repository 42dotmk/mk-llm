Q: 20% of the job candidates at a temp agency have experience with Excel. 70% of the candidates are only willing to work day shifts. If a manager picks a candidate at random, what are the odds they know Excel and are willing to work nights?
A: First find the percentage of candidates who are willing to work nights: 100% - 70% = 30%. Then multiply that percentage by the percentage who know Excel to find the percentage who meet both qualifications: 30% * 20% = 6%. The answer is 6.

[Question]A retailer sells any shirt for the same price and any pair of pants for the same price, but the price of shirts and pants are not the same. Say you bought 2 shirts and 3 pairs of pants for $120 in total, then you realized you didn't need the extra pants. What's the price of 1 shirt at this place if when you returned all 3 pairs of pants you were refunded 25% of what you originally paid?
[Answer]If I paid $120 and I was refunded 25% for all the 3 pants, then that means I received 25% * 120 = $30. This means the total price of the 2 shirts was 120 - 30 = 90. The price of one shirt is thus 90 / 2 = 45. The answer is 45.
Q: Wild Bill can shoot a pistol while riding his horse at full speed. His horse runs at 20 feet per second, and a bullet fired from his gun flies at a speed of 400 feet per second. But if he fires a gun while riding his horse, and the gun is aimed in the same direction that the horse is running, how much faster, in feet per second, is the bullet flying than if he fires the bullet in the opposite direction of what the horse was running?
A: If he fires a bullet in the same direction as the direction that the horse is running, the total speed of the bullet is the sum of the speed the bullet was propelled out of the gun plus the speed of the horse, for a combined speed of 400 + 20 = 420 feet per second. If he fires a bullet in the opposite direction as the direction in which the horse is running, then the total speed of the bullet is the speed the bullet was propelled out of the gun minus the speed of the horse, for a resulting speed of 400 - 20 = 380 feet per second. Thus, when firing the gun in the same direction as the horse is running, the bullet moves at 420 - 380 = 40 feet per second faster than when he fires the bullet in the opposite direction as what the horse is running. The answer is 40.
