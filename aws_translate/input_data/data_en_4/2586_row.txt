They say there are 4 types of people with differing learning styles which clearly link with the four stages of the learning cycle.

The original text, without spaces, can make comprehension difficult, so let's break down the components and discuss each part.

- 4 types of people with differing learning styles: This refers to the four commonly known learning styles that people tend to have or lean towards while trying to acquire new knowledge or skills. These learning styles are Visual, Auditory, Read/Write, and Kinesthetic (often referred to as VARK). People usually have a preference for one or a combination of these learning styles.

1. Visual: Visual learners prefer to see things. They learn more effectively through the use of graphics, diagrams, images, and visual presentations that allow them to visualize the concepts and ideas. They may create concept maps, highlight key points in different colors, or utilize graphic organizers to help them understand complex information. 

2. Auditory: Auditory learners are individuals who learn best through listening and talking. They prefer discussions, lectures, and audiobooks over written material. They may benefit from reading aloud, using mnemonic devices, or participating in group discussions and debate.

3. Read/Write: These learners primarily understand and retain information through reading and writing. They may prefer textbooks, written exercises, and taking detailed notes while reading or listening. They tend to benefit from rewriting concepts in their own words, summarizing information, or analyzing written material thoroughly. 

4. Kinesthetic: Kinesthetic learners are those who learn best through hands-on experiences. They prefer to engage in physical activities, experiments, demonstrations, and role-playing. These learners may benefit from taking breaks during study sessions, using tangible resources to represent concepts, or associating information with bodily sensations.

- Four stages of the learning cycle: This refers to a framework known as the experiential learning cycle developed by David Kolb. The four stages in the cycle are Concrete Experience, Reflective Observation, Abstract Conceptualization, and Active Experimentation.

1. Concrete Experience: This stage involves the learners actively participating in an experience that exposes them to the subject matter.

2. Reflective Observation: During this stage, learners reflect upon the experience they have been exposed to and identify their thoughts and feelings about it.

3. Abstract Conceptualization: At this stage, the learners try to make sense of their reflections by connecting them with existing knowledge, forming new concepts and ideas, or revising previous beliefs.

4. Active Experimentation: Here, learners apply the newly acquired knowledge to new situations and test out the concepts they have formed. This leads them back to a new concrete experience, restarting the cycle.

In conclusion, there is a clear connection between the four types of learners and the four stages of the learning cycle. By understanding different learning styles and applying them to the experiential learning cycle, educators and learners can maximize their potential for knowledge acquisition and personal growth.
