The Harry Potter books, written by British author J.K. Rowling, take place over a span of seven years, each year covering an academic year in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The storyline begins with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Sorcerer's Stone in the United States) and ends with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Here's a detailed breakdown of the timeline and events taking place in the series:

1. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Sorcerer's Stone):
This first book takes place during the 1991-1992 academic year. The story begins when Harry turns 11 years old, learns about his magical heritage, and joins Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This is also when he first meets his best friends, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.

2. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets:
The second book covers the 1992-1993 academic year at Hogwarts. This year, Harry and his friends investigate the titular Chamber of Secrets and unravel the school's dark history involving Salazar Slytherin and the basilisk.

3. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban:
This third installment takes place during the 1993-1994 academic year. This year, the infamous Sirius Black escapes from the wizarding prison, Azkaban, and is believed to be after Harry. The story revolves around unraveling the truth about Sirius Black and his connection to Harry and his parents, James and Lily Potter.

4. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire:
This book occurs in the 1994-1995 academic year. During this time, Harry unexpectedly and controversially becomes a participant in the dangerous Triwizard Tournament. The tournament is held to promote magical cooperation between Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang schools of magic. The climactic finale marks the return of the dark wizard, Lord Voldemort.

5. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix:
The fifth book covers the 1995-1996 academic year. As few believe Harry and Dumbledore's claims about Voldemort's return, the Order of the Phoenix, a secret society, is reestablished to oppose Voldemort and his Death Eaters. This year, Harry becomes more deeply involved in the war against Voldemort, as he and Dumbledore's Army, a student-led group, prepare to fight Dark forces.

6. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince:
The sixth book takes place during the 1996-1997 academic year. The story revolves around unraveling the mysterious identity of the Half-Blood Prince and learning about Lord Voldemort's steps to immortality, horcruxes. The war against Voldemort takes a tragic turn as Dumbledore, the Hogwarts headmaster, dies at the end of the year.

7. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows:
The final book is not constrained to an academic year as Harry, Ron, and Hermione leave Hogwarts to search and destroy Voldemort's remaining horcruxes. It begins in summer 1997 and ends in May 1998, thus roughly spanning the 1997-1998 timeline. The series reaches its climax with the Battle of Hogwarts, where several beloved characters meet their end, and Harry ultimately defeats Lord Voldemort.

In conclusion, the Harry Potter books take place from 1991 to 1998, with each book covering one academic year, apart from the last one, which wraps up the storyline outside the school setting and culminates in the defeat of Lord Voldemort.
