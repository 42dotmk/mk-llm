From the information provided, we can delve into multiple aspects of the relationship between political decisions and religious tensions in the period of Louis XIII and Louis XIV in France. Notably, the course of action they took affected not only the Huguenots but also impacted the politics, economy, and social dynamics of the country. Starting from Louis XIII's reign, the implementation of the Edict of Nantes, which granted certain rights to the Huguenots, varied wildly based on the contemporary political climate.

After Louis XIII's death, his son, Louis XIV, started to gain control of France. Known for his hostility towards the Huguenots, Louis XIV began to disregard some of the provisions of the Edict, thus weakening the protections it offered to the Protestants. This shift in approach was notably apparent in 1661, marking the start of a gradually intensifying campaign against Protestantism in France.

In 1681, Louis XIV furthered his efforts to suppress the Huguenots by implementing the policy of dragonnades. This policy employed the use of military troops, specifically dragoons, to pressure Huguenot families into converting to Roman Catholicism or leaving the country under the threat of violence and harassment. The dragonnades, while not explicitly outlawing Protestantism, made life very uncomfortable for Huguenots, pushing them towards a difficult choice of religious compromise or migration.

However, Louis XIV took the final and most significant step against the Huguenots in October 1685, with the issuance of the Edict of Fontainebleau. This edict affected a complete turnaround, revoking the Edict of Nantes and making Protestantism illegal in France. Consequently, this move stripped Huguenots of their previously acknowledged religious and civil rights, pushing religious tolerance in France to a breaking point.

The revocation had severe repercussions for France. While it did not lead to renewed religious warfare, it still prompted a wave of migration from France. Many Huguenots chose to leave the country rather than convert to Catholicism. These individuals primarily found refuge in regions like Great Britain, Prussia, the Dutch Republic, and Switzerland where Protestantism was more prevalent and accepted.

Notwithstanding the exodus, a significant population of Protestants remained in France, specifically in the CÃ©vennes region of the Massif Central. Known as the Camisards, this group of Protestants initiated a resistance against the government in response to Louis XIV's anti-Protestant policies. They launched a revolt in 1702, leading to intermittent skirmishes that didn't conclusively end until 1715. Despite continued oppression, the government substantially reduced their assault on the Camisards post-1715.

In conclusion, the religious policies under the reign of Louis XIII and Louis XIV significantly influenced the practice of Protestantism in France. From fluctuating enforcement of the Edict of Nantes, through the intimidation campaigns of dragonnades, to the final revocation of the Edict, their reigns marked a dramatic curbing of religious liberty and the resulting migration and revolt. These events underline the profound impacts of politics on religious freedom and societal dynamics.
