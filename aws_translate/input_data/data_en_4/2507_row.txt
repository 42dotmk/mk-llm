Herman buys himself and 3 team members breakfast 5 days a week so that’s 4 * 5 = 20 breakfast combo meals. Each combo meals costs $4.00 and he buys 20 of them a week so that’s 4 * 20 = $80.00. Over a 16 week period he spends 16 * 80 = $1,280.00 on breakfast.
The answer: 1280
Reverse engineering the question: When Herman’s team is busy working on large projects he stops at the drive-through 5 days, every week to buy a breakfast combo for himself and 3 members of his team. Each meal costs $4.00. This current project will last 16 weeks. How much will Herman spend on breakfast?

Reasoning and answer: They already have 20 tubs in storage, so they only need to buy 100 needed tubs - 20 tubs in storage = 80 tubs. From the new vendor, they buy 80 tubs / 4 = 20 tubs. They now have a total of 20 + 20 = 40 tubs. They are therefore going to buy 100 needed tubs - 40 owned tubs = 60 tubs from the usual vendor.
The answer: 60

Question: A pharmacy is buying enough tubs for them to make their prescriptions this week. They already have 20 tubs left in storage but they need a total of 100 tubs for the week. Of the tubs they still need to buy, they buy a quarter from a new vendor then decide to go to their usual vendor for the rest. How many tubs is the pharmacy going to buy from the usual vendor?

First find the total number of pieces of mail the post office receives per day: 60 letters + 20 packages = 80 pieces of mail. Then multiply the daily amount of mail by the number of days per month: 80 pieces / day * 30 days / month = 2400 pieces / month. Then multiply that number by 6 to find the total number of pieces of mail handled: 2400 pieces / month * 6 months = 14400 pieces.
The answer: 14400
Reverse engineering the question: The post office receives 60 letters and 20 packages per day. How many pieces of mail does it handle in six months if all the months have 30 days?

Reasoning and answer: 24 / 2 = 12 students are doing silent reading. 24 / 3 = 8 students are playing board games. So 12 + 8 = 20 students are accounted for. Then 24 - 20 = 4 students are catching up on homework.
The answer: 4

Question: In the class of 24 students, half are doing silent reading, and a third are playing board games. The rest are catching up on homework. How many students are catching up on homework?

Ken paints 3 tiles / minute + 2 tiles / minute = 5 tiles / minute. Laura can paint 5 tiles / minute x 2 = 10 tiles / minute. Kim can paint 10 tiles / minute - 3 tiles / minute = 7 tiles / minute. All 4 can paint 3 tiles / minute + 5 tiles / minute + 10 tiles / minute + 7 tiles / minute = 25 tiles / minute. In 15 minutes, they can paint 15 minutes x 25 tiles / minute = 375 tiles.
The answer: 375
Reverse engineering the question: Don can paint 3 tiles a minute, Ken can paint 2 more tiles a minute than Don and Laura can paint twice as many tiles as Ken. Kim can paint 3 fewer tiles than Laura can in a minute. How many tiles can Don, Ken, Laura and Kim paint in 15 minutes?

It would take Lily 255 words / 15 wpm = 17 minutes to type without taking a break. Since Lily takes a break after 10 minutes of typing she takes 17 minutes + 2 minutes = 19 minutes.
The answer: 19
