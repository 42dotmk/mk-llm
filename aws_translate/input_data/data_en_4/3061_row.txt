Jesse, as an educator or instructor, understands the importance of providing clear guidelines and instructions to his students to ensure smooth functioning of the classroom and to facilitate the learning process. There are several reasons why Jesse wrote instructions on the board for the students on how to turn their assignments in.

1. Accessibility and Visibility: Writing the instructions on the board makes them easily accessible and visible to all students in the classroom. It ensures that everyone gets the same information and can refer to the instructions anytime during the class. This also helps in reducing any classroom distractions and ensuring that students stay focused on their tasks.

2. Reducing Miscommunication: Providing clear guidelines in a written format helps in reducing miscommunication, as students can always refer back to the instructions if they have any doubts or forget any details. This further helps in saving time and maintaining order in the classroom, as students will be less likely to seek clarification from the teacher repeatedly.

3. Encouraging Independence: By providing step-by-step instructions for submitting assignments, Jesse is encouraging his students to be independent and take responsibility for their learning. This fosters a sense of autonomy and self-reliance, which are essential skills for students to develop in preparation for higher education and the workforce.

4. Enhancing Time Management: Detailed instructions about assignment submission help students understand the time frame, method of submission, and any other requirements for completing their tasks. This helps them effectively manage their time and develop a sense of discipline, while also setting realistic expectations for themselves.

5. Catering to Different Learning Styles: Providing instructions in multiple formats caters to the diverse learning styles of students. Some students may prefer verbal instructions, while others might find written instructions on the board more helpful. By complementing verbal instructions with written ones, Jesse is catering to the varied needs of his students and ensuring that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed.

6. Establishing Consistency and Routine: Displaying instructions for submitting assignments consistently, be it daily or weekly, helps in creating a routine that students can follow. This further aids in fostering a sense of discipline and order, promoting a conducive learning environment.

7. Encouraging Inclusivity: It is possible that some students in Jesse's class might have learning disabilities, language barriers, or other challenges that can make it difficult for them to understand instructions when they are only provided verbally. By writing the instructions on the board, Jesse is ensuring that he is reaching out to all students, thereby promoting an inclusive and supportive educational environment.

In summary, Jesse's decision to write instructions on the board for turning in assignments was motivated by various factors, ranging from easing communication and enhancing time management to fostering independence and inclusivity among his students. This thoughtful approach demonstrates Jesse's commitment to effective teaching and enhancing his students' overall learning experience.
