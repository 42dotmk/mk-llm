With a storied career spanning 19 years, Janikowski, also nicknamed "Seabass," was known for his consistency, accuracy, and aptitude in attempting and converting long field goals.

Janikowski's journey to the NFL began when he was drafted by the Oakland Raiders in the first round of the 2000 NFL Draft out of Florida State University.
