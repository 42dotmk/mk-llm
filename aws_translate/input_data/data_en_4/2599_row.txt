Question: Donna worked 2 hours every morning walking dogs in her neighborhood for $10.00 an hour. 5 days a week, after school, she worked at a card shop for 2 hours and made $12.50 an hour. On the weekends, she usually made $10.00 an hour babysitting and was guaranteed 4 hours every Saturday from her neighbor. How much money did she make over 7 days?
Answer: She makes $10.00 an hour for 2 hours walking dogs so she makes 10 * 2 = $20.00 every morning. Over 7 days she makes 7 * 20 = $140.00 a week. She makes $12.50 for 2 hours working at a card shop so she makes 12.5 * 2 = $25.00. She works there 5 days a week so she makes 5 * 25 = $125.00 a week. She also babysits for 4 hours making $10.00 an hour for a total of 4 * 10 = $40.00. Over 7 days, she makes 140 + 125 + 40 = $305.00. The answer is 305.

Q: Out of the 300 comic books in a comic store, 30% are liked by females, males like 120, and both genders don't like the rest. What percentage of the comic books are disliked by both males and females?
A: The number of comic books that females like is 30 / 100 * 300 = 90 books. Together, both males and females like 90 + 120 = 210 comic books. The number of comic books that are disliked by both males and females is 300 - 210 = 90. The percentage of books that are disliked by both genders is 90 / 300 * 100 = 30%. The answer is 30.

[Question]James has five huskies, two pitbulls and four golden retrievers, all female. They became pregnant and each golden retriever had two more pups than each husky. If the huskies and pitbulls had 3 pups each, How many more pups than adult dogs are there in total?
[Answer]There are 5 + 2 = 7 huskies and pitbulls. 7 huskies and pitbulls had 3 pups each for a total of 3 * 7 = 21 pups. Each golden retriever had 2 more pups each than the huskies who had 3 each so each golden retriever had 3 + 2 = 5 pups. 4 golden retrievers had 5 pups each for a total of 20 pups. There are a total of 21 + 20 = 41 pups. There are a total of 5 + 2 + 4 = 11 adult dogs. There are 41 - 11 = 30 more pups than adult dogs. The answer is 30.
