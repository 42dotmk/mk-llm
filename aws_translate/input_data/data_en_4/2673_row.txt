In the context of the development of Optimality Theory at the LSA summer institute in 1991 by Alan Prince and Paul Smolensky, the concept of constraints and their importance in phonology and morphology is crucial for understanding the overall architecture of languages. The main idea of Optimality Theory is that languages choose the pronunciation of a word that best satisfies a list of constraints that are ordered by importance, allowing for a lower-ranked constraint to be violated in order to obey a higher-ranked constraint.

Regarding the question of which aspect – phonology or morphology – has more importance with constraints, it is essential to first understand the distinction between the two. Phonology is the study of the distribution and patterning of speech sounds, or phonemes, in a language while morphology is concerned with the structure and formation of words through the combination of morphemes, which are the smallest units of meaning in a language.

In Optimality Theory, both phonological and morphological constraints play significant roles in determining the pronunciation and structure of words in a language. However, their importance may vary depending on the specific linguistic context and the properties of the language in question.

In the original development of Optimality Theory, the primary focus was on phonological constraints. These constraints govern aspects such as syllable structure, assimilation, and stress placement in a language. The theory suggests that languages have an inventory of possible phonological constraints, and each language has its own specific ranking of these constraints, which determines the possible pronunciations of a word.

Soon after the introduction of Optimality Theory, its scope was extended to morphology by John McCarthy and Alan Prince. Morphological constraints deal with issues such as the arrangement of morphemes in a word, the selection of specific allomorphs (variant forms of a morpheme), and the realization of inflectional and derivational morphology in a language. Like phonological constraints, morphological constraints are ranked according to their importance in a language, with lower-ranked constraints being violated when necessary to satisfy higher-ranked constraints.

Overall, both phonological and morphological constraints hold importance in the structure and pronunciation of words in a language under the framework of Optimality Theory. Their relative importance may depend on the linguistic context and specific properties of the language under analysis. It is essential to note, however, that Optimality Theory and its grounding on phonetic substance have been criticized by proponents of "substance-free phonology," such as Mark Hale and Charles Reiss. These critics argue against the reliance on phonetic grounding of constraints and representational elements like features, suggesting alternative ways to approach the study of phonology and morphology without assuming predetermined linguistic elements based on phonetic substance. Despite these criticisms, Optimality Theory remains a dominant trend in the study of phonology and morphology and sheds light on the importance of constraints and their relative ranking in the organization of linguistic systems.
