Q: Barbara wants to save up for a new wristwatch that costs $100. Her parents give her an allowance of $5 a week and she can either save it all up for the watch or spend it as she wishes. 10 weeks pass and due to spending some of her money on ice cream, Barbara currently only has $20. How many more weeks does she need to save for a watch if she stops spending on other things right now?
A: Since barbara needs $100, and she currently has $20, she is remaining with $100 - $20 = $80 to save. With an allowance of $5 each week, she'll need to save for 80 / 5 = 16 weeks. The answer is 16.
Question: Rose bought a plant with a 10% discount. If the price is $10, how much did Rose pay after the discount?

[Question]Claudia offers art classes to kids and charges $10.00 for her one-hour class. If 20 kids attend Saturday’s class and half that many attend Sunday’s class, how much money does she make?
[Answer]Sunday’s class is half the size of Saturday’s class with 20 kids so Sunday has 20 / 2 = 10 kids. She has 20 kids on Saturday and 10 kids on Sunday for a total of 20 + 10 = 30 kids. She charges $10.00 per kid and teaches 30 kids over the weekend so she makes 10 * 30 = $300.00. The answer is 300.
Q: At the end of the first quarter, the winning team had double the points of the losing team. At the end of the second quarter, the winning team had 10 more points than it started with. At the end of the third quarter, the winning team had 20 more points than the number it had in the second quarter. If the total points the winning team scored in the game was 80, and the losing team had 10 points in the first quarter, calculate the total number of points the team scored in the fourth quarter.
A: At the end of the first quarter, the winning team had double the points of the losing team, meaning the winning team had already scored 10 * 2 = 20 points. At the end of the second quarter, the winning team had 10 more points than it started with, a total of 20 + 10 = 30 points. At the end of the third quarter, the winning team had 20 more points than the number it had in the second quarter, a total of 20 + 30 = 50 points. If the total points the winning team scored in the game was 80, they scored 80 - 50 = 30 points in the fourth quarter. The answer is 30.
Question: Asha has to buy some gifts but has no money. She decides to borrow $20 from her brother, $40 from her father, $30 from her mother and is gifted $70 by her granny. She adds this to her savings of $100 and goes out to Target to get what she wanted. If she spent 3/4 of the money, how much money did she remain with?
Answer: With the amount borrowed from her family, she has a total of 20 + 40 + 30 = 90 dollars. With the amount gifted from her granny, she has 70 + 90 = 160 dollars. She adds this to her savings, ending up with a total of 160 + 100 = 260 dollars. She spends 3 / 4 of this money, which is 3 / 4 * 260 = 195 dollars. The total she remains with is 260 - 195 = 65 dollars. The answer is 65.
