[Question]Some friends wanted to make a road trip from New York to Los Angeles. They drove at a constant speed of 62 miles/hour, taking breaks of 30 minutes every 5 hours. Once in the city, they looked for the hotel for 30 minutes. If the trip took around 2,790 miles, how many hours will they have to spend to complete the trip to the hotel?
[Answer]At a constant speed of 62 miles / hour, they will drive 2,790 miles / 62 miles / hour = 45 hours in total. Every 5 hours they take a break, they will take 45 hours / 5 hours / break = 9 breaks. Those breaks will be 9 breaks x 30 minutes / break = 270 minutes in total. In hours, the breaks will be in total 270 minutes ÷ 60 minutes / hour = 4.5 hours. To find the hotel it took them 30 minutes ÷ 60 minutes / hour = 0.5 hours. In total, it will take 45 hours + 4.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 50 hours to complete the trip. The answer is 50.
Q: The age of Gladys is equal to twice the sum of the ages of Billy and Lucas. Billy is 3 times younger than Gladys who is 30 years old now. How old will Lucas be three years from now?
A: Billy's age is 30 / 3 = 10 years old. The sum of the ages of Billy and Lucas is 30 / 2 = 15. So, Lucas is 15 - 10 = 5 years old now. Therefore, Lucas will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old three years from now. The answer is 8.
Question: Eliza buys 200 ornamental rings to sell in their local shop, twice the number of the remaining stock. After selling 3/4 of the total stock, her mother buys 300 more ornamental rings, and after three days, sells 150. What's the total number of ornamental rings remaining in the store?
Answer: If Eliza restocked twice the original number of ornamental rings, the number was 200 / 2 = 100 rings. The total number of ornamental rings in stock is now 200 + 100 = 300 rings. When she sells 3 / 4 of the stock, the total number of rings sold is 3 / 4 * 300 = 225 rings. The remaining stock is 300 - 225 = 75 rings. When her mother buys 300 more rings, the stock is boosted to 75 + 300 = 375 rings. She then sells out 150, reducing the stock to 375 - 150 = 225 rings. The answer is 225.
[Question]Youngsville had a population of 684 people. The town had a growth spurt and the population increased by 25% then they witnessed that 40% of the population moved away. What is the current population?
[Answer]The town had 684 people then had a 25% growth spurt increasing the population by 684 * .25 = 171 people. The town had 684 people then they added 171 people bringing the population to 684 + 171 = 855 people. There were 855 people and 40% moved away so it decreased by 855 * .40 = 342. The population was 855 and 342 people moved away making the new population 855 - 342 = 513 people. The answer is 513.
