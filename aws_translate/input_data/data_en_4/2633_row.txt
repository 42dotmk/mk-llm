(I). Benjamin did not know any people there.

Though Benjamin was generally quite sociable, he found himself rather uneasy and out of his comfort zone this particular evening. He hadn't known that Donald, his roommate and close friend, had managed to encircle himself with such a diverse and eclectic group of intriguing individuals. A keen observer of human nature, this party was the perfect place for Benjamin to put his observational skills to the test.

Upon entering the grand, high-ceilinged party hall, Benjamin felt the palpable shift from his everyday life into this world that was so clearly Donald's domain. Resplendent chandeliers cast a warm, inviting glow upon the guests, whose appearances ranged from the impeccably dressed to the fantastically bohemian. Conversations varying from philosophy and poetry to business strategies buzzed in different corners of the grand hall. However, Benjamin's lack of acquaintance made him feel alien in this elaborate tableau.

Sticking close to Donald, Benjamin moved through the sea of strangers, attempting to acclimate to this hitherto unknown realm. Donald, comfortable in his element, flowed from group to group like a seasoned diplomat, enthralling his audience irrespective of the topic. Left to his own devices, Benjamin found himself at a loss, only picking up fragments of discussions from the party’s many clusters of conversation.

Realizing he needed to take some initiative, Benjamin adopted the role of an eager listener. He started shadowing Donald not just physically but conversationally too. He would keep an ear out for engaging topics and tried to subtly contribute when he could. He read about most subjects, be it politics, literature, sports or pop-culture and used it to his advantage. Soon, he could sense a drop in his anxiety as he realised that he was quite capable of holding complex conversations with people much more experienced and exposure-wise potent than him.

As the evening passed, Benjamin discovered more layers to Donald's life that he was clueless about. He was amazed to uncover facets of their friendship that spanned more than their shared apartment. Donald's rich and varied interests, represented by the party's eclectic group, challenged Benjamin in a way he hadn't anticipated. While Donald had a novel ready to narrate about seemingly every individual present, he seemed to carry an affectionate patience for Benjamin's more reserved nature.

Slowly, with Donald’s help and his own efforts, Benjamin started to feel more at ease. He found some common ground with a group of foreign film enthusiasts, and before he knew it, he was partaking in an animated discussion about international cinema. The initial unease gradually gave way to a buzzing energy, as Benjamin found himself amongst new friends with shared interests.

In retrospect, Benjamin realized that sticking to Donald was a lifeline at the beginning of the party, but by the end of the night, he found himself navigated through the party’s uncharted territory. The party turned out to be a night of unexpected evolution for Benjamin, shifting from an outsider to an active participant in the melting pot of discussions, marking his first successful voyage into Donald’s diverse world of connections.
