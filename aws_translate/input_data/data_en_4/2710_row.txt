Question: There are 24 toys in the box and ¼ of them are action figures. The remaining toys are all dolls. How many dolls are there?
Answer: Since there are 24 toys in the box, there are ¼ * 24 = 6 action figures. Because the rest of the toys are dolls, there are 24 - 6 = 18 dolls in the box. The answer is 18.
[Question]Noah’s bedroom light uses 6 watts per hour. His office light is much brighter so he can see to work and uses three times as much energy. The living room light has a much larger space to cover and has to be more powerful, so it uses four times as much energy as his bedroom light. If Noah leaves all those lights on for two hours, how many watts has he used?
[Answer]Noah’s bedroom light uses 6 watts per hour, so it would use 2 * 6 = 12 watts in two hours. His office light uses 3 times as many watts as his bedroom light, so it uses 3 * 6 = 18 watts per hour. In two hours, the office light would use 18 * 2 = 36 watts. The living room light uses 4 times as many watts as his bedroom light, so it uses 4 * 6 = 24 watts per hour. In two hours, the living room light would use 24 * 2 = 48 watts. Thus, if Noah leaves all those lights on for two hours, he has used 12 + 36 + 48 = 96 watts. The answer is 96.
Q: Crystal wanted to sell everything left in her pastry class before closing for the night. She reduced her $3.00 cupcakes and her $2.00 cookies by half. How much money did she make if she sold the last 16 cupcakes and 8 cookies?
A: She reduced the price of the $3.00 cupcakes by half so they are now 3 / 2 = $1.50. She reduced the price of the $2.00 cookies by half so they are now 2 / 2 = $1.00. She sold 16 cupcakes at $1.50 each so she made = 16 * 1.50 = $24.00. She sold 8 cookies at $1.00 each so she made 8 * 1 = $8.00. She made $24.00 from the cupcakes and $8.00 from the cookies for a total of 24 + 8 = $32.00. The answer is 32.
Question: June’s class has 25 students. 60% are girls and the rest are boys. 40% of the boys like playing basketball and the rest don't. The number of girls who like playing basketball is double the number of boys who don't like to. What percentage of the girls in the class like playing basketball?
Answer: 40% of the class is boys because 100 - 60 = 40. There are 10 boys because 25x.4 = 10. 60% of the boys don't like playing basketball because 100 - 40 = 60. 6 boys don't like playing basketball because 10x.6 = 6. 12 girls like playing basketball because 6x2 = 12. There are 15 girls in the class because 25 - 10 = 15. 80% of the girls in class like playing basketball because 12 / 15 = .8. The answer is 80.
[Question]Brenda raises mice, and her adult mice recently had three litters of 8 each. She gave a sixth of the baby mice to her friend Robbie to keep as pets. She sold three times the number of babies she gave Robbie to a pet store. Half of the remaining mice were sold to snake owners as feeder mice. How many baby mice did Brenda have left?
[Answer]Brenda’s mice had 3 * 8 = 24 baby mice. She gave Robbie 24 / 6 = 4 mice. Thus, she sold 3 * 4 = 12 mice to the pet store. She had 24 - 12 - 4 = 8 mice remaining. She sold 8 / 2 = 4 as feeder mice. Thus, Brenda had 8 - 4 = 4 mice left. The answer is 4.
