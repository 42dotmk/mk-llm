[Question]Jack has a grove with 4 trees by 5 trees. It takes 6 minutes to clean each tree. He gets help to clean the trees so it only takes half as long. How many hours did he spend cleaning trees?
[Answer]There were 4 * 5 = 20 trees to clean. So it took 20 * 6 = 120 minutes. That is 120 / 60 = 2 hours. So he spent 2 / 2 = 1 hour cleaning. The answer is 1.
Q: Mary is trying to get Zoom set up for the first time. She spent 10 minutes downloading the Mac version, only to realize she needed the Windows version, which took three times as long to download. During her first call, the audio glitched twice for 4 minutes each time and the video glitched once for 6 minutes. She spent twice as long talking without glitches as with glitches. How much time did Mary spend downloading Zoom and talking total?
A: First find the time Mary spent downloading the Windows version: 10 minutes * 3 = 30 minutes. Then find the total time the audio glitches took: 4 minutes / glitch * 2 glitches = 8 minutes. Then add the video glitch time to find the total glitch time: 8 minutes + 6 minutes = 14 minutes. Then double that time to find the total glitch - free time: 14 minutes * 2 = 28 minutes. Then add the talking time to the download time to find the total time: 30 minutes + 10 minutes + 14 minutes + 28 minutes = 82 minutes. The answer is 82.
Question: Susan walked to the market to buy five dozen peaches. To carry them home, she brought two identically-sized cloth bags and a much smaller knapsack. Into the knapsack she placed half as many peaches as she placed in each of the two cloth bags. How many peaches did she put in the knapsack?
Answer: 5 dozen peaches is 5 * 12 = 60 peaches. Let "x" be the number of peaches put into the knapsack. Thus, the total number of peaches is x + (2 * x) + (2 * x) = 60. Simplifying the expression, we see that 5 * x = 60. Dividing each side of the equation by 5, we see that x = 12 peaches,. The answer is 12.
[Question]Doris earns $20 per hour by babysitting. She needs to earn at least $1200 for her monthly expenses. She can babysit for 3 hours every weekday and 5 hours on a Saturday. How many weeks does it take for Doris to earn enough to cover her monthly expenses?
[Answer]Doris babysits for a total of 5 weekdays x 3 hours / weekday = 15 hours. She babysits for a total of 15 + 5 = 20 hours in a week. She earns 24 x $20 = $480 in a week. So, it will take $1440 / $480 = 3 weeks to earn Doris needed amount. The answer is 3.
Q: A clothing store has an inventory of 34 ties, 40 belts, 63 black shirts, and 42 white shirts. The number of jeans in the store is two-thirds of the sum of black and white shirts, and the number of scarves is half the number of the sum of ties and belts. How many more jeans are there than scarves?
A: The sum of black and white shirts is 63 + 42 = 105. The number of jeans in the store is (2 / 3) x 105 = 70. The sum of ties and belts is 34 + 40 = 74. The number of scarfs in the store is 74 / 2 = 37. There are 70 - 37 = 33 more jeans than scarfs in the store. The answer is 33.
