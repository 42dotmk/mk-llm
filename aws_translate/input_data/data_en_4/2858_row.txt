Olympics in Sochi represented a showcase for Russia's resurgence as a global power and a confirmation of his strong leadership. He was counting on the world's attention to be on the sporting events and the achievements of the athletes, not on the escalating unrest in a neighboring country.

However, the violence in Kiev and the rising death toll were impossible to ignore. Just as the Sochi Olympics were about to end, the crisis in Ukraine reached a boiling point, with protesters not only demanding the ousting of then-President Viktor Yanukovych, who had strong ties to Moscow, but also seeking closer ties with the European Union.

In the days following the bloodshed, the Ukrainian parliament voted to remove President Yanukovych from office and issued a warrant for his arrest on charges of "mass murder of peaceful citizens." Yanukovych fled to Russia, where he was granted protection.

The events in Ukraine forced Putin to shift his focus from Sochi's Olympics to a political crisis that threatened his influence in the region. In response to the turmoil, Putin took a series of aggressive measures, including the annexation of Crimea, a region in Ukraine with a predominantly ethnic Russian population, in March 2014. The move sparked international outrage and sanctions against Russia.

Forced to manage the crisis in Ukraine, Putin sought to achieve the following objectives:

1. Regain control over Crimea and assert Russian influence in the region.
2. Prevent Ukraine from moving closer to the European Union and Western alliances, which he perceived as a threat to Russia's national security.
3. Maintain Russia's strategic Black Sea fleet based in Crimea.
4. Bolster nationalist sentiment in Russia and reinforce his image as a strong and decisive leader.

The situation in Ukraine deteriorated further, as pro-Russian separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk declared independence from Ukraine and engaged in a conflict with Ukrainian forces. This fueled a prolonged and bloody war that has claimed thousands of lives and displaced over a million civilians.

The tension between Russia and the West was further exacerbated by the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 in July 2014 over eastern Ukraine, which killed 298 people. International investigators concluded that the plane was shot down by a Russian-supplied missile. Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement and blamed Ukraine for the tragedy.

Despite efforts by the international community to find a diplomatic solution, the conflict in Ukraine remains unresolved. Due to Russia's annexation of Crimea and the ongoing fighting in eastern Ukraine, Putin's role on the global stage has been characterized by increasing tension and discord with Western powers, which has led to a new era of geopolitical rivalry.

In conclusion, the most logical completion of the news story highlights how the Sochi Olympics' success was overshadowed by the escalating crisis in Ukraine, which forced Putin to focus on securing Russian interests in the region. The ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kyiv has had significant geopolitical repercussions, causing the unraveling of relations between Russia and the West, and shaping the international landscape in a manner reminiscent of the Cold War.
