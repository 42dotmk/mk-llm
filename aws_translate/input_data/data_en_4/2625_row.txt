Q: Mia is buying Christmas gifts for her family. She has spent $30 on each of her 3 siblings, and the rest of her spending was for her parents. If Mia spent a total of $150 on Christmas gifts and each of her parents received gifts of equal value, how much money, in dollars, did she spend on each parent’s gift?

[Question]A florist is making bouquets for the weekend. The florist uses red, yellow, orange, and purple flowers, and each bouquet contains 9 flowers of any color combinations. This week he planted 125 seeds for each color of flower. Unfortunately, a fungus killed 45 red flowers, 61 yellow, 30 orange, and 40 purple flowers. How many bouquets can the florist make this weekend?
[Answer]There were 125 seeds planted for each of the 4 colors of flower, so there were 125 * 4 = 500 flowers planted. The fungus killed 25 red, 31 yellow, 30 orange, and 40 purple flowers, 45 + 61 + 30 + 40 = 176 flowers dead. This leaves 500 - 176 = 324 flowers for the bouquets. If the florist puts 9 flowers in each bouquet, he can make 324 / 9 = 36 bouquets this weekend. The answer is 36.
Q: For many years, the number of sharks in Pelican Bay has been twice the number of Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove.  But today scientists say one-third of the Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove have moved to Pelican Bay. If there are still 60 sharks in Pelican Bay, how many Pelicans remain in Shark Bite Cove?
A: If there are 60 sharks in Pelican Bay, and this number is twice the number of Pelicans that usually live in Shark Bite Cove, then there were 60 / 2 = 30 Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove. If one - third of the Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove move to Pelican Bay,. then 30 / 3 = 10 Pelicans will have moved away. This would leave 30 - 10 = 20 Pelican remaining in Shark Bite Cove. The answer is 20.
