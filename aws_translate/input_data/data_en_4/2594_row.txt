Q: Nicole has three older sisters. After each one outgrows their clothes, they give them to Nicole. They have all outgrown their clothes and have given them all to Nicole. Nicole started with 10 pieces of clothing. Her first older sister had half as many clothes as Nicole. The next oldest sister had 2 more pieces of clothing than Nicole. The oldest had the average of what her three younger sisters had. How many pieces of clothing does Nicole end up with?
A: The first sister has 5 pieces of clothing because 10 / 2 = 5. The next sister had 12 pieces of clothing because 10 + 2 = 12. The three youngest sisters combined have 27 pieces because 10 + 5 + 12 = 27. The oldest has 9 pieces because 27 / 3 = 9. Nicole ends up with 36 pieces of clothing because 10 + 5 + 12 + 9 = 36. The answer is 36.
Question: James paints a 20 ft by 15 ft mural. It takes him 20 minutes to paint 1 square foot and he charges $150 per hour. How much does he charge to paint the mural?
Answer: The mural is 20 * 15 = 300 square feet. So it takes him 300 * 20 = 6000 minutes. So he paints it in 6000 / 60 = 100 hours. That means he charges 100 * 150 = $15000. The answer is 15000.
[Question]A bag has seven apples, eight oranges, and 15 mangoes. Luisa takes out two apples from the bag, and takes out twice as many oranges as apples as she took from the bag. She then takes out 2/3 the number of mangoes from the bag. What is the remaining number of fruits in the bag?
[Answer]When Luisa takes out two apples from the bag, 7 apples - 2 apples = 5 apples remain in the bag. She also takes 2 apples * 2 oranges / apple = 4 oranges from the bag. The total number of oranges remaining in the bag is 8 oranges - 4 oranges = 4 oranges. Additionally, a total of 2 / 3 * 15 mangoes = 10 mangoes are also removed from the bag. The total number of mangoes remaining in the bag is 15 mangoes - 10 mangoes = 5 mangoes. The total number of fruits that Luisa left in the bag is 5 apples + 4 oranges + 5 mangoes = 14. The answer is 14.
Q: The ages of three brothers are consecutive integers with the sum of 96. How old is the youngest brother?
A: Let x represent the youngest brother. Middle brother:x + 1. Oldest brother:x + 2. Total:x + x + 1 + x + 2 = 96. 3x + 3 = 96. 3x = 93. x = 31 years old. The answer is 31.
Question: There are 2000 pinecones on the ground. 20% are eaten by reindeer. Twice as many are eaten by squirrels as reindeer. 25% of the remainder are collected to make fires. How many pinecones are left?
Answer: First find the number of pinecones eaten by reindeer: 20% * 2000 pinecones = 400 pine cones. Then find the total number of pinecones eaten by squirrels: 400 pine cones * 2 = 800 pine cones. Then subtract those two amounts to find the number of pinecones left: 2000 pinecones - 400 pine cones - 800 pine cones = 800 pinecones. Divide that number by 4 to find the number that are collected for fires: 800 pinecones / 4 = 200 pine cones. Then subtract that number from the 800 pinecones to find the total left on the ground: 800 pine cones - 200 pinecones = 600 pine cones. The answer is 600.
