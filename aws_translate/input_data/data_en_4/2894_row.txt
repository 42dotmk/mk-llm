Question: Chris wants to hold his breath underwater for 90 straight seconds so he starts training each day. On the first day, he holds it for 10 seconds. On the second day, he holds it for 20 seconds. On the third day, he holds it for 30 seconds. After realizing that he can hold it for ten extra seconds each day, he realizes he can calculate how many days it is until he reaches 90 if he keeps up the same pace. So how many days until he can hold his breath for 90 seconds?
Answer: He still has to improve by 60 more seconds because 90 - 30 = 60. This will take 6 days because 60 / 10 = 6. The answer is 6.
[Question]Kimmie received $450 from her handmade crafts at the supermarket. Her friend Zahra received 1/3 less money when she sold the same amount of handmade crafts at Etsy. If both of them save half of their earnings on the same savings account, calculate the total amount of money in the joint savings account?
[Answer]Zahra received 1 / 3 * $450 = $150 less money from the sale of her craft at Etsy. The total amount of money that Zahra sold her handmade crafts for is $450 - $150 = $300. Kimmie saved 1 / 2 * $450 = $225 of her earnings into the joint savings account. Zahra saved 1 / 2 * $300 = $150 of her earnings into the joint savings account. Together, they have $225 + $150 = $375 in the savings account. The answer is 375.
Q: A supermarket receives a delivery of 15 cases of tins of beans. Each case contains 24 tins. If 5% of the tins are damaged and thrown away, how many tins of beans are left?
A: The supermarket has 15 cases × 24 tins / case = 360 tins of beans delivered to them. There are 360 tins × 0.05 = 18 tins that are damaged and unsellable. So in the end, there are 360 tins - 18 tins = 342 tins of beans that are left. The answer is 342.
Question: The bus driver drives an average of 2 hours each day, 5 days a week. From Monday to Wednesday he drove at an average speed of 12 kilometers per hour, and from Thursday to Friday at an average speed of 9 kilometers per hour. How many kilometers did the driver travel during these 5 days?
Answer: From Monday to Wednesday, there are 3 * 2 = 6 hours of work. During this time the driver drove 6 * 12 = 72 kilometers. On Thursday and Friday, there are 2 * 2 = 4 hours of work in total. During this time the driver drove 4 * 9 = 36 kilometers. So in total, the driver traveled 72 + 36 = 108 kilometers during these five days. The answer is 108.
[Question]Luca went to a sandwich shop for lunch. The sandwich he bought was normally $8, but he had a coupon for a quarter of the price off. He then upgraded it with sliced avocado for an extra dollar. After adding a drink and a $3 salad, his total lunch bill was $12. How many dollars did Luca pay for his drink?
[Answer]Luca’s coupon saved him 8 / 4 = $2 on his sandwich. He paid $1 for avocado on his sandwich, so the sandwich cost 8 - 2 + 1 = $7. He paid $3 for his salad, so his meal without the drink was 7 + 3 = $10. Thus, Luca paid 12 - 10 = $2 for his drink. The answer is 2.
