Title: The Sequence of Events: Golden Horde's Attack on Poland and Liubartas's Rule Over Volhynia

Introduction

In medieval Eastern European history, two significant events captured the attention of scholars and history enthusiasts alike: the Golden Horde's attack on Poland and Liubartas's reign over Volhynia. Although both took place in the mid-14th century, it is essential to pinpoint which event happened first. To answer this question, let's delve into the historical records and piece the events in their chronological order.

The Golden Horde's Attack on Poland

In the 13th century, the Mongol Empire, led by Genghis Khan, began conquering vast territories. One of its division, the Golden Horde, under the rule of Batu Khan, subdued various Slavic groups. The Golden Horde first invaded Poland in 1241 during the reign of Bolesław V The Chaste and conquered Kraków, Poland's capital at the time.

In the decades that followed, the Horde orchestrated numerous attacks on Polish territories, attempting to weaken and conquer it. The last substantial invasion took place in 1340, under the command of Ozbeg Khan. This invasion prompted Casimir III, known as Casimir the Great, who ruled Poland from 1333-1370, to bolster the country's defensive capabilities. The Horde's attack forced Poland to abandon, at least temporarily, its interest in the neighboring region of Volhynia.

Liubartas's Reign Over Volhynia

Meanwhile, Volhynia, a historic region straddling modern-day Ukraine, Poland, and Belarus, experienced significant internal strife and political turmoil throughout the 13th and 14th centuries. At the time, the Mongol Empire began to weaken, and the Golden Horde gradually lost its influence over various territories, including Volhynia. Many rulers sought to gain power and control over the resource-rich area.

Liubartas was one such ruler who sought to control Volhynia. Born to Gediminas, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, Liubartas inherited the western part of the region after the Treaty of 1320. His brother, Algirdas, inherited the eastern part of Volhynia. However, the decisive moment when Liubartas officially became the ruler of all of Volhynia occurred in 1340 when his brother Algirdas transferred the eastern part of the region to him, uniting Volhynia under Liubartas's rule.

Sequence of Events

Given these historical contexts, it becomes evident that the Golden Horde's attack on Poland in 1340 happened before Liubartas's full ascension to power over the united Volhynia. The invasion forced Poland temporarily to shift its focus from Volhynian territory, providing a favorable environment for Liubartas to establish control and unite the region under his rule. Thus, the Golden Horde's attack on Poland occurred before Volhynia was assigned to Liubartas in that same year.

Conclusion

While both the Golden Horde's attack on Poland and Liubartas's full acquisition of Volhynia took place in 1340, historical records indicate that the former event preceded the latter. This timeline clarifies a substantial moment in Eastern European history and sheds light on the complex political climate of the era. Understanding these chronological intricacies helps to comprehend the context and consequences of these pivotal events in the region's history.
