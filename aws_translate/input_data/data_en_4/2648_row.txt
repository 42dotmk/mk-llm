Q: Michael and Thomas are selling their lego collections. They agree to split any money they earn. They sell them based on how many circles are on top. Each circle costs 1 cent. They earned $5 each after selling 100 single pieces, 45 double pieces, 50 triple pieces and a number of quadruple pieces. How many quadruple pieces did they sell?
A: They made $10 because 2 x 5 = 10. They made $1 off single pieces because 100 x .01 = 1. They made $.9 off double pieces because 45 x .02 = .9. They made $1.5 off triple pieces because 50 x .03 = 1.5. They earned $3.4 off the first three types because 1 + .9 + 1.5 = 3.4. They earned $6.6 off the quadruple pieces because 10 - 3.4 = 6.6. They sold 165 quadruple pieces because 6.6 / .04 = 165. The answer is 165.
Question: Patricia has 4 barrels of 7 gallons each. All of them are empty, and there's only one faucet with a flow rate of 3.5 gallons per minute. How many minutes will it take to fill all 4 barrels?
Answer: If Patricia has 4 barrels and each barrel has 7 gallons, then in total she needs 4 * 7 = 28 gallons. If the faucet can provide 3.5 gallons every minute, then she will need 28 / 3.5 = 8 minutes to fill all 4 barrels. The answer is 8.
[Question]Baking in batches of 65 cupcakes, Carla made 45 batches of cupcakes for her daughter's birthday party. She then took 5 cupcakes from each batch, and fed them to her dogs. If Carla's daughter had 19 friends and they shared the remaining cupcakes equally among them, including the daughter, calculate the number of cupcakes that each of Carla's daughter's friends ate.
[Answer]If Carla sampled 5 cupcakes from each batch and fed them to her dogs, each batch had 65 - 5 = 60 cupcakes afterwards. Since Carla made 45 batches of cupcakes for her daughter's birthday party, after removing the 5 cupcakes from each batch, Carla's daughter and her friends received 45 * 60 = 2700 cupcakes. The total number of people at the party is 19 friends + 1 daughter = 20. After sharing the cupcakes equally among them, Carla's daughter and her friends each received 2700 / 20 = 135 cupcakes. The answer is 135.
Q: The Ravenswood forest has four times as many gnomes as the Westerville woods. If there are 20 gnomes in Westerville woods, how many gnomes would remain in Ravenswood forest if 40% of the gnomes are taken for use by the forest owner?
A: If there 20 gnomes in Westerville woods, the Ravenswood forest has 4 * 20 = 80 gnomes. If 40% of gnomes in the Ravenswood forest are taken for use by the owner of the forest, the number of gnomes will reduce by 40 / 100 * 80 = 32. The number of gnomes that will remain is 80 - 32 = 48. The answer is 48.
