Question: Barbie and Bruno have a pile of 144 coconuts that they need to move from one side of their yard to the other side. Barbie can carry 4 coconuts at a time, while Bruno can carry 8 coconuts at a time. If they make trips together carrying their maximum number of coconuts each time, how many trips together would they need to make to move all of the coconuts?
Answer: Together, they would carry a combined total of 4 + 8 = 12 coconuts per trip. To move 144 coconuts, they would need to make 144 / 12 = 12 trips. The answer is 12.
[Question]Helga went shopping for a new pair of shoes. At the first store, she tried on 7 pairs of shoes. At the second store, she tried on 2 more pairs than at the first store. At the third store, she did not try on any shoes, but she did buy a scarf. But at the fourth store, she tried on twice as many pairs of shoes as she did at all three other stores combined, before finally choosing a pair to buy. What is the total number of pairs of shoes Helga tried on before buying her new shoes?
[Answer]At the second store, she tried on 7 + 2 = 9 pairs of shoes. Therefore, at the first three stores, she tried on 7 + 9 + 0 = 16 pairs of shoes. At the fourth store, she tried on 16 * 2 = 32 pairs of shoes. Thus, in total, she tried on 16 + 32 = 48 pairs of shoes. The answer is 48.
Q: Moore's family compared mobile phone plans to get the best deal. At T-Mobile, the family plan costs $50 per month for the first two lines and $16 for each additional line. At M-Mobile, the family plan costs $45 for the first two lines and $14 for each additional line. Moore's family needs to purchase 5 cell phone lines. How much cheaper is the M-Mobile than T-Mobile?
A: The three additional lines at T - Mobile cost $16 x 3 = $48. The total cost of the family plan at T - Mobile is $50 + $48 = $98. The three additional lines at M - Mobile cost $14 x 3 = $42. The total cost of the family plan at M - Mobile is$45 + $ 42 = $87. Therefore, M - Mobile is $98 - 87 = $11 cheaper than T - Mobile. The answer is 11.

[Question]At a recent fishing tournament, Alex caught 7 times as many fish as Jacob. Jacob did not think that he had any chance of winning, but Alex became overconfident and knocked over his bucket of fish, losing 23 fish back to the lake. If Jacob had 8 fish at the beginning, how many more fish does he need to catch to beat Alex by just 1 fish?
[Answer]At the beginning, Jacob had 8 fish. Alex had 7 * 8 = 56 fish. After knocking the bucket over, Alex was left with 56 - 23 = 33 fish left. The final amount caught by Jacob to beat Alex by 1 fish is 33 + 1 = 34 fish. Then Jacob needs to catch 34 - 8 = 26 fish more. The answer is 26.
