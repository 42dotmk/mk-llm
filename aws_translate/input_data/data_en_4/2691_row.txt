Elena had been living there for the past five years. Elena happily agreed to share her knowledge and experience with her friend.

Elena started by explaining the cultural norms and etiquette in Japan to Felicia. She emphasized the importance of being polite and respectful as these are highly valued traits in Japanese society. "In Japan," Elena said, "it's crucial to show respect to others in your actions and speech. It's simple actions like bowing when you meet someone, saying 'itoashimasu’ before starting a meal, and ‘gochisosama deshita’ at the end of a meal, or thankfully accepting change with both hands at a store that can make a huge difference in how you're perceived. Using honorific titles like 'san', 'kun', or 'sama' after someone's name is also important. It indicates respect and acknowledgment."

Next, Elena emphasized the role of intricate customs tied to specific situations. For instance, she mentioned the tradition of taking one's shoes off before entering a home or certain traditional establishments. "You'll notice a change in the floor level," she explained, "That's your cue to remove your shoes. And remember to wear nice socks as your feet may be exposed!" She also talked about the bathhouse etiquette which includes washing thoroughly before entering the onsen and avoiding the use of mobile phones or loud conversations that could disrupt the serenity.

Elena also talked about punctuality, stating that it is highly prized in Japan. "Trains, meetings, appointments—all follow a strict timeline," she said, "Being late is seen as a lack of respect for others' time. Always plan to arrive at least ten minutes ahead of schedule—just to be safe."

She then moved on to discuss the societal norms. "Don't stick your chopsticks straight into a bowl of rice," warned Elena, "This is something you do at a funeral and is considered very disrespectful if done casually. Also, avoid blowing your nose in public. It's seen as a private act and could earn you some odd stares." 

Elena also advised Felicia on clothing standards. According to Elena, the Japanese prefer a more conservative dressing style. "Avoid revealing clothes," she said, "Especially in religious locations like temples."

Lastly, Elena advised Felicia on the importance of understanding the language, even if it's just basic conversational phrases or greetings. Although English is taught in schools, not every Japanese will be fluent or confident in it. "Knowing even basic phrases like 'Sumimasen' (excuse me), 'Arigatō gozaimasu' (thank you), 'Ohayō gozaimasu' (good morning), 'Konbanwa' (good evening) can be extremely helpful," said Elena. "Also, if you can, learn to read the two primary alphabets, Hiragana and Katakana. Many key signs, menus, and directions are written in these scripts."

Elena concluded her advice by wishing Felicia an enriching trip, "Japan is a beautiful country, Felicia, with a deep, complex, and fascinating culture. It may seem a bit daunting at first, but once you get the hang of it, you'll begin to appreciate the subtleties even more. Remember, it's all about respect, politeness, empathy, and understanding."

Felicia thanked Elena for her valuable advice and felt much more prepared and excited about her upcoming journey to Japan.
