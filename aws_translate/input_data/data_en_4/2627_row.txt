In the movie Counter-Attack, it is the Soviets who launch the offensive by sending a small paratrooper unit led by Colonel Semenov behind enemy lines. Their main objective is to attack a German divisional headquarters, capture an officer for interrogation, and gather intelligence on the Germans' plan for their major attack on the Eastern Front. This offensive is essential to the overall plot, as it fuels the tension and conflict between the characters throughout the film.

Contributing to the intrigue and suspense in the story is the construction of an underwater bridge by the Soviets, intended to conceal their movement and preparations from the Germans. Meanwhile, the Germans are amassing forces in the same sector, suggesting an imminent face-off between the two sides. The film's title, "Counter-Attack," implies that the plot revolves around the theme of strategic maneuvers and actions undertaken by both parties in response to the actions and advances of their adversaries.

The movie features an interesting blend of characters, including a resourceful paratrooper named Alexei Kulkov and Lisa Elenko, a local partisan guide. Their efforts, combined with the help of other characters like the partisans led by Kostyuk, make for an engaging and thrilling story. As Kulkov's mission progresses and he gets trapped with the captured German soldiers, the plot thickens, and the audience is left to wonder who among them is the elusive disguised officer.
