Scene: A cozy living room, filled with a warm atmosphere and comfortable furniture. Finn and Rory, proudly wearing their family tartans in their kilts, sit down for a light afternoon tea and discuss the upcoming wedding plans. 

Rory: (taking a sip of tea) So Finn, are ye excited about the big day? It's fast approaching!

Finn: Aye, Rory, it's all a bit surreal, but I'm more than excited to marry Jo. We've been through so much together and it's time to start the next chapter in our lives. What about you, how's the best man speech coming along?

Rory: (laughs) Well, I've been tryin' to write somethin' worthy of your wedding, my friend. It's comin' along gradually, but if there's any special moment or story you want me to include, you'd better let me know now.

Finn: Oh, there are definitely a few memorable moments from our friendship that I'd love for you to share, but I trust your judgment in deciding which ones make the final cut. Just make sure ye keep it PG, for the sake of the grandparents. 

Rory: (chuckles) I'll do me best, Finn. No promises though, eh? Now, let's talk about the stag party. I've got a few ideas, but I wanted to know if you had any preferences. After all, it's your last night as a free man!

Finn: (smirking) I do trust you to plan a great night, Rory, but I'd prefer something not too wild. How about a pub crawl around some of our favorite spots, and culminating with a ceilidh to dance the night away? This way, all the lads can enjoy, and we still have some traditional Scottish fun, aye?

Rory: A pub crawl and a ceilidh sound just grand! It's a brilliant way to have everyone involved, and I'm sure we'll have a cracking good night! I'll start lookin' for a proper ceilidh band and booking some pubs. Now, let's talk about the wedding itself. Have you and Jo finalized the venue and guest list?

Finn: Yes, we've both settled on the stunning castle grounds near our hometown, and we've managed to trim down the guest list to just our closest family and friends. We want to keep it intimate and meaningful, without breaking the bank.

Rory: Ah, the castle will make for a gorgeous backdrop, and it's even more fitting with us wearing kilts on the big day. Speaking of which, how's the preparin' for the family tartans been going?

Finn: The tartans are coming along beautifully. We've decided to have my family's tartan on my kilt and Jo's family tartan on the bridesmaids' shawls, to honor both our heritages. We're all measured up and the kilts and shawls for the bridal party should be ready in a few weeks.

Rory: That sounds perfect, Finn. Jo and you have thought of everything, and I'm sure it's going to be a beautiful wedding. I'll keep workin' on the speech and plan the stag do down to the last pint. Just remember, no matter what happens on the big day, the most important thing is the love you and Jo share.

Finn: Thank you, Rory. That means more to me than ye can imagine. I'm grateful to have you by my side through all of this.

As they continue discussing the wedding plans, their laughter and bond fill the air of the cozy living room. The stage is set for not only a beautiful, Scottish wedding but also a memorable stag party and speech from the best man Rory who aims to make this celebration one that Finn and Jo will always cherish.
