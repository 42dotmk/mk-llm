The roses cost 150 * 20 = $3000. The gardener works 4 * 5 = 20 hours. So the gardener charges 30 * 20 = $600. The soil added another 5 * 100 = $500. So in total the cost was 3000 + 600 + 500 = $4100.
The answer: 4100

Reasoning and answer: To deliver all the coal, you need to pass by 6 coal / 2 coal / station = 3 stations. To deliver all the iron, you need to pass by 12 iron / 3 iron / station = 4 stations. To deliver all the wood, you need to pass by 2 wood / 1 wood / station = 2 stations. So 4 stations are needed to deliver everything, so 4 stations * 25 minutes / station = 100 minutes are needed.
The answer: 100

Reasoning and answer: The amount spent on mango juice is 94 - 54 = 40 dollars. Dividing the 40 dollars by the cost of a glass of mango juice gives us 40 / 5 = 8 people. Since a glass of pineapple juice goes for $6, the number that ordered is 54 / 6 = 9 people. Adding both numbers gives a total of 8 + 9 = 17 people.
The answer: 17

Reasoning and answer: First find Carolyn's total violin practice time by tripling her piano practice time: 20 minutes / day * 3 = 60 minutes / day. Then find the total amount of time she spends practicing each day: 60 minutes / day + 20 minutes / day = 80 minutes / day. Then find the total time she spends practicing each week: 80 minutes / day * 6 days / week = 480 minutes / week. Then find the total time she spends practicing each month: 480 minutes / week * 4 weeks / month = 1920 minutes / month.
The answer: 1920
