Question: Sherman has a 30-minute commute to the office and a 30-minute commute home every day. On the weekends, he spends 2 hours, each day, driving his kids to their different activities. How many hours does Sherman drive a week?
Answer: He drives 30 minutes to work and 30 minutes home every day for a total of 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. He makes this drive 5 days a week for a total of 5 * 60 = 300 minutes. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour and he drives 300 minutes, 5 days a week so that's 300 / 60 = 5 hours. He drives 2 hours on both Saturday and Sunday so he drives 2 * 2 = 4 hours on the weekends. He commutes 5 hours during the week and spends 4 hours driving on the weekend for a total of 5 + 4 = 9 hours. The answer is 9.
[Question]Irene shares half of a small apple with her dog every day. A small apple weighs about 1/4 of a pound. She can currently buy apples for $2.00 a pound. How much will she spend so that she and her dog have enough apples to last for 2 weeks?
[Answer]There are 7 days in a week and she needs apples for 2 weeks so that's 7 * 2 = 14 days. She shares an apple with her dog every day so for 14 days so she needs 1 * 14 = 14 apples. Each apple weighs 1 / 4 of a pound and she needs 14 apples so that's .25 * 14 = 3.5 pounds of apples. She needs 3.5 pounds of apples and they are on sale for $2.00 a pound so she will spend 3.5 * 2 = $7.00 for apples. The answer is 7.
