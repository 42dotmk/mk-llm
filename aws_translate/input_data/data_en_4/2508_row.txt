Q: Julia collects old watches. She owns 20 silver watches, and three times as many bronze watches. She decided to buy gold watches to add to her collection, a number that represents 10% of all the watches she owns. How many watches does Julia own after this purchase?
A: Julia owns 3 * 20 = 60 bronze watches. 60 + 20 = 80 total silver and bronze watches. 10% of all Julia's watches is 80 * 10 / 100 = 8 watches, and she decided to buy so many gold watches. So in total Julia is in possession of 20 + 60 + 8 = 88 watches. The answer is 88.

[Question]Mason is a caterer packing up silverware and plates for a big corporate event. Each piece of silverware weighs 4 ounces, and there are three pieces of silverware per setting. Each plate weighs 12 ounces, and there are two plates per setting. If Mason needs enough settings for 15 tables with 8 settings each, plus 20 backup settings in case of breakage, how many ounces will all the settings weigh?
[Answer]First find the total weight of the silverware per setting: 4 ounces / piece * 3 pieces / setting = 12 ounces / setting. Then find the total weight of the plates per setting: 12 ounces / plate * 2 plates / setting = 24 ounces / setting. Then add those two amounts to find the total weight per setting: 12 ounces / setting + 24 ounces / setting = 36 ounces / setting. Then multiply the number of tables by the number of settings per table to find the number of table settings: 15 tables * 8 settings / table = 120 settings. Then add the 20 backup settings to find the total number of settings: 120 settings + 20 settings = 140 settings. Then multiply the total number of settings by the weight per setting to find the total weight: 140 settings * 36 ounces / setting = 5040 ounces. The answer is 5040.
