A long-distance relationship (LDR) works through consistent communication, trust, understanding, and setting clear expectations. While it's true that being physically apart from your partner presents unique challenges, a successful long-distance relationship is possible and has been achieved by many couples. The key elements in making an LDR work include:

1. Communication: One of the most important factors in maintaining any relationship, communication is especially vital in a long-distance relationship. It's crucial to establish open lines of communication where both parties can express their feelings, concerns, and needs. Utilize technology such as video calls, texts, voice calls, and instant messaging to stay connected with your partner.

2. Trust: Trust is the foundation of every relationship. In a long-distance relationship, it's particularly important to trust that your partner is committed and will stay faithful. Insecurity or jealousy can poison the relationship, so both partners need to work on building trust by being honest and open with one another.

3. Expectations: Set clear expectations about the level of commitment, schedule for communication, visits, and any other aspects of the relationship. Being on the same page about what each person expects from the LDR can help avoid disappointment and misunderstandings.

4. Quality time: Even though you cannot be physically together, sharing experiences and quality time is crucial. Plan to watch movies or TV shows simultaneously, play online games together, or have a "virtual date" on video calls.

5. Set goals: Discuss and establish short-term and long-term goals together. Having a plan helps both parties know what they are working towards and provides hope for the future. Goals could include planned visits, future vacations, or plans to eventually live in the same location.

6. Be supportive: Emotional support is significant in a long-distance relationship. Be there for your partner during the ups and downs, knowing that separation can sometimes amplify feelings of loneliness or stress.

7. Visits: Plan regular visits to spend quality time together, providing opportunities to strengthen the bond, and create shared memories. Having visits to look forward to can provide motivation during harder times.

8. Cultivate individual growth: Although it's essential to focus on your relationship, having personal goals, hobbies and a social life can make the time apart feel more manageable and help maintain a sense of identity.

Yes, there are numerous examples of successful long-distance relationships. Couples who flourish despite the distance often demonstrate the key elements mentioned earlier - communication, trust, and having shared goals. It's important to note that what might work for one couple may not suit others, but with effort, flexibility, and commitment, a long-distance relationship can be successful.

Regarding your two questions, they are related but not exactly the same.
