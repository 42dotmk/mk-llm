Title: How to Freshen Up Your Shoes with Baking Soda and Essential Oils

Introduction

Shoes can quickly become a breeding ground for unpleasant odors, especially after a long day of walking, running or sweating in them. One of the most practical and cost-effective ways to eliminate shoe odors is by using a simple yet potent combination of baking soda and essential oils. Baking soda gently absorbs odors, while essential oils add a refreshing and pleasant fragrance to your shoes. In this article, we'll explain the step-by-step process of freshening up your shoes using baking soda and essential oils.

Supplies Needed:

- 2 tablespoons of baking soda
- 5 drops of essential oil (of your choice)
- A small bowl
- A fork
- A measuring spoon (1 tablespoon)

Procedure:

1. Prepare the mixture

To begin, pour 2 tablespoons of baking soda into a small bowl. This will be the base of your deodorizing mixture. Next, add 5 drops of your chosen essential oil for fragrance. You can use any essential oil you prefer, such as lavender, lemon, eucalyptus or tea tree oil. Each of these oils offers a distinct and pleasing scent that will help eliminate the unpleasant odors coming from your shoes. Combine the baking soda and essential oil by stirring them together with a fork until the mixture is evenly blended.

2. Apply the mixture to your shoes

Using a measuring spoon, scoop up 1 tablespoon of the baking soda mixture, and pour it into the heel of each shoe. Make sure the mixture is evenly distributed by gently tapping the heel against a hard surface or shaking the shoe. This will help send the baking soda into the toe area of the shoe, covering more of the internal surface.

3. Allow the shoes to sit

Let the shoes sit with the baking soda mixture inside for several hours or preferably overnight. The longer you leave the mixture in the shoes, the more time it will have to absorb the odors and freshen your shoes with the pleasing fragrance of the essential oils. You can leave your shoes in a well-ventilated area or outside during this process to further help eliminate shoe odors.

4. Dispose of the baking soda mixture

After several hours or the following day, take the shoes and tilt them downward, allowing the excess baking soda to fall out into a trash can or sink. Gently tap the shoes against a hard surface to help remove any remaining baking soda from inside. Make sure not to inhale the baking soda dust while doing this step.

5. Repeat as necessary

If your shoes still have a lingering odor or if you have multiple pairs to treat, simply repeat steps 1-4 as needed. It's important to note that this method works best on shoes made of fabric or canvas material. For leather shoes, it's advisable to use a specialized leather cleaner and conditioner instead to avoid damaging the shoes.

Conclusion

Freshening up your shoes with baking soda and essential oils is a simple and cost-effective solution for eliminating shoe odors. It not only helps remove unpleasant smells, but it also leaves your shoes smelling fresh and clean, improving the overall feel and comfort of wearing them. By incorporating this routine into your shoe care regimen, you can extend the life of your shoes while maintaining a pleasant and welcoming aroma.
