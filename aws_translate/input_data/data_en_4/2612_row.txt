[Answer]The first winner will receive 2400 / 3 = $800. There will be 2400 - 800 = $1600 left. The other winners will receive 1600 / 10 = $160 each. The answer is 160.
Q: Tonya spent $90.00 on art supplies. 4 canvases cost $40.00 and a mixed set of paints cost 1/2 that much. She also spent $15.00 on an easel, and the rest of the money on paintbrushes. How much money did she spend on paintbrushes?
A: The canvases cost $40.00 and she spent half that amount on paint so she spent 40 / 2 = $20.00 on paint. She spent $40.00 on canvases, $20.00 on paint and $15.00 on an easel so she spent 40 + 20 + 15 = $75.00. She spent $90.00 total and her other purchases totaled $75.00 so she spent 90 - 75 = $15.00 on paint brushes. The answer is 15.

[Question]Very early this morning, Elise left home in a cab headed for the hospital. Fortunately, the roads were clear, and the cab company only charged her a base price of $3, and $4 for every mile she traveled. If Elise paid a total of $23, how far is the hospital from her house?
[Answer]For the distance she traveled, Elise paid 23 - 3 = 20 dollars. Since the cost per mile is $4, the distance from Elise’s house to the hospital is 20 / 4 = 5 miles. The answer is 5.
Q: Jo-Bob hopped into the hot air balloon, released the anchor rope, and pulled on the lift chain, which ignited the flame and provided the warm air that caused the balloon to rise. When the lift chain was pulled, the balloon would rise at a rate of 50 feet per minute. But when the chain was not being pulled, the balloon would slowly descend at a rate of 10 feet per minute. During his balloon ride, he pulled the chain for 15 minutes, then released the rope for 10 minutes, then pulled the chain for another 15 minutes, and finally released the chain and allowed the balloon to slowly descend back to the earth. During his balloon ride, what was the highest elevation reached by the balloon?
A: The first 15 - minute chain pull caused the balloon to rise 50 * 15 = 750 feet. Releasing the chain for 10 minutes caused the balloon to descend 10 * 10 = 100 feet. The second 15 - minute chain pull caused the balloon to rise another 50 * 15 = 750 feet. Thus, at the end of the second chain pull, when the balloon was at its highest elevation, the balloon had risen to an elevation of 750 - 100 + 750 = 1400 feet above the earth's surface. The answer is 1400.
