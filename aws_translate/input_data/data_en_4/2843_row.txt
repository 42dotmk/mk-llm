The questions are not exactly the same, as they inquire about the most interesting thing learned about each respective team - the Netherlands and Spain - during their World Cup match against each other. In response, I will provide an analysis of the most interesting discoveries for each team during that match.

Netherlands:
The most interesting thing we learned about the Netherlands' World Cup team during their 2014 World Cup match against Spain was their adaptability and the strength of their offensive strategies. This match displayed the Dutch team's ability to dismantle Spain's highly-skilled defense. Netherlands won this match with a remarkable 5-1 victory, showcasing their advanced techniques and tactics.

The Dutch team, led by coach Louis van Gaal, implemented a 5-3-2 formation, which allowed them to take advantage of their talented forwards, Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie. Their tactic of utilizing long balls and putting immense pressure on Spain's defense led to numerous scoring opportunities - and eventually, many goals. This match proved that the Dutch team possessed a strong attack; as a matter of fact, the Netherlands had scored the highest number of goals in the 2014 World Cup group stages.

Their performance against Spain not only signified their offensive prowess but also exposed the strengths of several key players, such as Daley Blind's pivotal role in creating opportunities for his teammates, Jasper Cillessen's excellent goalkeeping, and the leadership of veteran players like Dirk Kuyt. Overall, this match taught us that the Netherlands' team was a force to be reckoned with.

Spain:
In contrast, the most interesting thing we learned about Spain's World Cup team during their match against the Netherlands was their vulnerability and the shortcomings in their defensive strategy. They entered the World Cup as the reigning champions, having won the tournament in 2010, and were expected to showcase their prowess once again in Brazil.

However, the match against the Netherlands exposed some weaknesses in their usual tactics, particularly their tiki-taka style, which relies on short passing and constant movement to maintain possession and control the game. The Dutch team disrupted this approach by employing an effective high-press strategy and quick counter-attacks. Spain's defense struggled against the pace and skill of players like Robben and Van Persie, who exploited the gaps left by their defenders.

The Spanish team appeared lackluster and unprepared against the relentless Dutch attack. This match highlighted that the once-dominant Spanish side, which featured legendary players like Iker Casillas, Sergio Ramos, Xavi, and Andres Iniesta, had become susceptible to stronger, more adaptable opponents. The defeat against the Netherlands was the beginning of Spain's unsuccessful World Cup campaign in 2014, as they were ultimately eliminated in the group stages.

In conclusion, while both questions are related, they focus on different aspects and lessons learned from the Netherlands and Spain during their World Cup match against each other. The Netherlands displayed their adaptability, offensive power, and key players' strengths, while Spain's vulnerability and defensive weaknesses were evident during the match.
