Plot:

The story takes place in the late 1960s, in the small, conservative Midwestern town of Havenwood, where the Taylor family has been a prominent fixture for generations. Inez Taylor, a bright and determined 16-year-old, is the only child of William and Meredith Taylor. William, a lawyer, is an active member of the local Republican Party and has announced his candidacy to be Havenwood's mayor in the upcoming election. Meredith, a homemaker and town socialite, is also involved in community politics, championing conservative values and hosting fundraisers to support local Republican candidates.

Inez, however, is less enthusiastic about her parents' politics and aspires to break free from their traditional expectations whenever possible. A talented writer and rebel at heart, Inez spends her free time working on the school newspaper, where she pens investigative and thought-provoking articles.

As news of her father's mayoral candidacy spreads, Inez is tasked by her school newspaper editor to cover the upcoming election and her family's growing prominence within it. She decides to use this opportunity to explore and question the motives behind her parents' political affiliation. This assignment sparks an ongoing conversation between Inez and her parents, challenging their held beliefs and motives behind their conservative values.

While researching for her article, Inez discovers that her paternal grandmother was a suffragette and labor rights activist, who defied society's expectations of women in her time. Inez finds inspiration in her grandmother's story and begins to explore the nuances of politics and societal expectations from different generations.

Overwhelmed with the pressure of her father's campaign, Inez's parents become consumed with maintaining the perfect family image and growing more conservative in the public eye. Inez, however, continues to broaden her horizons, finding solace in her writings, and befriending a group of young progressive activists in a neighboring town that inspires her to reconsider her parents' political beliefs.

Inez's newfound convictions put her in direct conflict with her father, and their relationship grows increasingly strained as Election Day approaches. The night before the election, Inez publishes a controversial article in the school newspaper, disclosing a scandal involving a local Republican official that her father had been trying to cover up. The fallout threatens William's chances of winning the mayoral race, and he disowns his daughter publicly.

The election does not go in William's favor, and the town is swept with political upheaval as progressive ideas begin to take hold. Inez's bravery in spotlighting the truth leads her to receive a prestigious journalism scholarship from a liberal arts college in New York City.

In the aftermath of the election, Inez's parents have a moment of reconciliation, as her actions force them to reassess their own values and confront their held prejudices. The movie ends with Inez leaving Havenwood to attend college in New York City as her parents watch from a distance, holding out hope for a future where they can reconcile their political differences and rebuild their fractured family.
