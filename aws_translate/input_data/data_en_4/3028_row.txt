B: Less

To better understand how the entire planet heating up would result in less sediment being transported, let's first analyze the process of sediment transportation and the factors that affect it:

1. Weathering and erosion: The process of sediment transportation begins with the weathering and erosion of rocks and soil. This is primarily influenced by factors such as precipitation, temperature fluctuations, wind, and biological processes. Increased temperatures can lead to an acceleration in chemical weathering processes and potentially induce more intense precipitation events.

2. Sediment Availability: As the weathering and erosion processes dislodge sediment particles, they become available for transportation by gravity, wind, and water. The availability of sediment to be transported depends on the rate at which it is weathered and eroded, and on the stability of the landscape, which may be affected by land-use changes, vegetation coverage, and other human-induced changes.

3. Sediment Transport Agents: Water, wind, and ice act as primary sediment transport agents. The ability of these agents to transport sediment depends on their velocity, discharge, and sediment-carrying capacity. Planet-wide heating may result in the melting of ice, which reduces the capacity for sediment transportation by ice. Additionally, increased temperatures can increase evapotranspiration rates, which could reduce the amount of water available for transporting sediment.

Now, let's consider how the entire planet heating up would affect the various stages of sediment transportation and ultimately result in less sediment being transported:

1. Accelerated weathering and erosion: While higher temperatures can increase the rate of chemical weathering, they can also lead to reduced vegetation cover and less organic material in the soil, which can, in turn, make the soil more susceptible to erosion. This may result in a short-term increase in sediment availability, but over time, the reduced vegetation cover will likely lead to the depletion of sediment for transport, ultimately contributing to less sediment being moved.

2. Reduced water availability: With higher global temperatures comes increased evapotranspiration rates and potential changes in precipitation patterns. This can lead to significantly lower water levels in rivers, reducing their ability to carry sediment. Additionally, less ice means less sediment transport by glaciers, further contributing to the overall reduction in sediment transportation.

3. Decreased sediment-carrying capacity: As water levels drop, the velocity of rivers may also decrease, reducing their sediment-carrying capacity and making it more difficult for them to transport sediment effectively. This results in the sediment being more likely to settle and remain in place, rather than being transported to other locations.

In conclusion, the entire planet heating up would likely result in less sediment being transported within the earth's systems. This is primarily due to reduced water availability for sediment transport, as well as the potential depletion of sediment through accelerated weathering and erosion processes, which may be insufficiently replenished due to reduced vegetation cover and other impacts of climate change.
