A bogus car dealer made thousands of pounds by wiping the mileage off cars before selling them on to unassuming drivers. Maxwell Stuart Alvey, from Arnold, Nottinghamshire, profited in excess of £100,000 in just 10 months after buying a fleet of vans at auction then tampering with their mileage. People who bought the vans complained to Trading Standards after noticing there was an unusual amount of wear and tear for their mileage. In one case he reduced the mileage of a Mercedes Sprinter by more than 275,000miles from 364,370 to just 89,000. When cross-referenced with auction house records with AutoTrader records it was discovered he had taken more than 200,000 miles off another Mercedes Sprinter van before selling it to a plumber in Derby. Pegasus Plumbing Services forked out £6,319 for the vehicle which Alvey had bought for £4,423 at auction just weeks earlier. Mark Denton, contracts manager for. Pegasus, bought the 55-registration. Mercedes from Alvey who claimed it had clocked a mere 76,000 miles when in fact it had done 276,000. Mr Denton said: 'I was looking for a. larger van and when I saw the Mercedes it looked ideal. It was five. years old when we bought it, so the 76,000 miles quoted in the advert. was reasonable for a commercial vehicle. 'The price was a little bit lower. than the dealer prices I’d seen for the same model but because I thought. I was buying privately I wasn’t suspicious. 'When I went to see the van it looked. in good condition and Mr Alvey seemed a genuine character. He told us. the vans he sold were all supplied by the same company. 'We had the van HPI-checked - which it passed - and went ahead and bought it.' Angus will be sentenced today at Nottingham crown court for the series of offences. After altering the milometer readings. and tidying the bodywork, Alvey typically advertised the vans at between. £1,000 and £2,000 more than he had paid for them at auction. Trading Standards officers sifted. through documents and sales records relating to 123 vehicles, 111 of. which had already been sold. The. remaining 12 vehicles found in Alvey’s possession were seized. Only. four of the 123 vehicles had not had their milometer readings altered. In. total, 22 of the vehicles had milometer readings reduced by 100,000. miles or more, with two vans having more than 200,000 miles wiped off. their real mileage. Councillor Mick Murphy, Cabinet. member for community safety at Nottinghamshire County Council, said: 'The extent of the vehicle clocking in this case is absolutely shocking. 'Mr. Alvey not only ripped off unsuspecting buyers, he placed their safety. at risk by making them think they were driving a vehicle with much less. wear and tear.' Alvey, has admitted 10 counts of fraud and will be sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court today. His then-partner, Jane Louise Starbrook, was cleared of any involvement in the fraud at an earlier hearing. Following. sentencing, Trading Standards’ Proceeds of Crime team will begin. proceedings to recoup profits Alvey has made from the van scam.
