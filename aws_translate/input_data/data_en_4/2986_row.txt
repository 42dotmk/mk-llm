Question: Mason is trying to download a 880 MB game to his phone. After downloading 310 MB, his Internet connection slows to 3 MB/minute. How many more minutes will it take him to download the game?
Answer: First find how many MB are left to download: 880 MB - 310 MB = 570 MB. Then divide that number by the download speed to find the download time: 570 MB / 3 MB / minute = 190 minutes. The answer is 190.
[Question]Dean ordered 2 large pizzas that were each cut into 12 slices. His friends Frank and Sammy came over to enjoy some pizza and watch a movie. Dean was hungry and ate half of the Hawaiian pizza. Frank only ate 3 slices of Hawaiian pizza and Sammy ate a third of the cheese pizza. How many total slices were left over?
[Answer]2 pizzas were ordered and had 12 slices each for a total of 2 * 12 = 24 slices. Dean ate 1 / 2 of a 12 sliced pizza so 12 / 2 = 6 slices were left over. Sammy ate 1 / 3 of a 12 sliced pizza so 12 / 3 = 4 slices were left over. Dean ate 6 slices, Sammy ate 4 and Frank had 3 so 6 + 4 + 3 = 13. They started with 24 slices and 13 slices so 24 - 13 = 11 slices left. The answer is 11.
Q: When Pogo, the four-legged martian, walks across the soft Martian soil, it leaves 4 footprints every meter. But Grimzi, the three-legged Plutonian, leaves only 3 footprints in the soft sands of Pluto for every 6 meters it walks. If Pogo travels 6000 meters across the soil of Mars, and Grimzi travels for 6000 meters across the fine sands of Pluto, what is the combined total number of footprints the two creatures will leave on the surfaces of their respective planets?
A: Since Pogo leaves 4 prints per meter, then over 6000 meters it would leave 4 * 6000 = 24,000 footprints on the soils of Mars. Grimzi leaves 3 prints per 6 feet, or 3 / 6 = 0.5 footprints per meter. Then over 6000 meters, Grimzi leaves 0.5 * 6000 = 3000 footprints on the sands of Pluto. In total, the two creatures will leave 24,000 + 3000 = 27,000 footprints. The answer is 27000.
Question: Natalia is riding a bicycle for the cycling competition. On Monday she rode 40 kilometers and on Tuesday 50 kilometers. On Wednesday she rode 50% fewer kilometers than the day before. On Thursday she rode as many as the sum of the kilometers from Monday and Wednesday. How many kilometers did Natalie ride in total?
Answer: On Wednesday she covered half of the distance from Tuesday, so 50 / 2 = 25 kilometers. On Thursday she rode 40 + 25 = 65 kilometers. In total, Natalia rode 40 + 50 + 25 + 65 = 180 kilometers. The answer is 180.
[Question]Niles is collecting his book club's annual fees. Each of the six members pays $150/year towards snacks, plus $30 each for six hardcover books and $12 each for six paperback books. How much money does Niles collect in total?
[Answer]First find the cost per member of the hardcover books: $30 / book * 6 books = $180. Then find the cost per member of the paperback books: $12 / book * 6 books = $72. Then find the total cost per member: $180 + $72 + $150 = $402 / member. Now find the total amount of money by multiplying the cost per member by the number of members: $402 / member * 6 members = $2412. The answer is 2412.
