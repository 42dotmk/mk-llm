Question: April went to a concert that has two bands. 2/3 of the audience was there for the second band and 1/3 was there for the first band. 50% of the audience there for the second band is under the age of 30. Of this group, 60% are women and there are 20 men. How many people are at the concert?
Answer: Of the under - 30s there for the second band, 40% are men because 100 - 60 = 40. There are fifty under - 30s there for the second band because 20 / .4 = 50. There are 100 people there to see the second band because 50 / .5 = 100. There are 150 people at the concert because 100 / (2 / 3) = 150. The answer is 150.

Q: Carl buys index cards for his class. He gives each student 10 index cards. He teaches 6 periods a day and each class has 30 students. If a 50 pack of index cards cost $3 how much did he spend on them all?
A: He has 30 * 6 = 180 students. So he needs to buy 180 * 10 = 1800 index cards. That means he needs to buy 1800 / 50 = 36 packs of index cards. So he spends 36 * 3 = $108. The answer is 108.
Question: To keep himself busy in class, Michael makes rubber-band balls. He makes two sizes, large and small. A small ball uses 50 rubber bands. A large ball requires 300 rubber bands. Michael brought a 5,000 pack to class and already made 22 small balls. How many large balls can he make with the remaining rubber bands?
Answer: Michael has used 1,100 rubber bands because 22 x 50 = 1,100. Michael has 3,900 rubber bands remaining because 5,000 - 1,100 = 3,900. Michael can make 13 large balls because 3,900 / 300 = 13. The answer is 13.
[Question]Martha needs to paint all four walls in her 12 foot by 16 foot kitchen, which has 10 foot high ceilings. Each wall needs one coat of primer and two coats of paint. If Martha can paint 40 square feet per hour, how many hours will it take her to paint the kitchen?
[Answer]There are two walls that are 12' X 10' and two walls that are 16' by 10'. First find the size in square feet of one 12' x 10' wall by multiplying the height and length: 12 ft * 10 ft = 120 sq ft. Multiply that quantity by 2 since there are two 12' x 10' walls: 120 sq ft * 2 = 240 sq ft. Then find the size in square feet of one 16' x 10' wall by multiplying the height and length: 16 ft * 10 ft = 160 sq ft. Multiply that quantity by 2 since there are two 16' x 10' walls: 160 sq ft * 2 = 320 sq ft. Now add the square footage of both sets of walls to find the total square footage Martha needs to paint: 240 sq ft + 320 sq ft = 560 sq ft. Now multiply that amount by 3 because Martha needs to add 3 coats: 560 sq ft / coat * 3 coats = 1680 sq ft. Finally, divide the total square footage by Martha's painting rate to find how many hours she needs to finish: 1680 sq ft / 40 sq ft / hour = 42 hours. The answer is 42.
