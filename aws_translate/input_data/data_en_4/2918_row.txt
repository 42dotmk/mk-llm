Q: Matt wants to repaint his house. He needs to paint three walls in his living room, which is a square 40 feet by 40 feet, and all four walls in his bedroom, which is a rectangle 10 feet by 12 feet. All the walls in Matt's house are 10 feet tall. How many total square feet of wall does Matt need to paint?
A: First figure out how many square feet a wall in the living room is: 40 feet length * 10 feet height = 400 square feet. Now multiply by 3 since Matt needs to paint three living room walls: 400 square feet / wall * 3 walls = 1200 square feet. Next figure out how many square feet the long walls in the bedroom are: 12 feet * 10 feet = 120 square feet. There are two long walls, so multiply this figure by 2: 120 square feet / wall * 2 walls = 240 square feet. Next figure out how many square feet the short walls in the bedroom are: 10 feet * 10 feet = 100 square feet. Multiply this by 2, since there are two short walls: 100 square feet / wall * 2 walls = 200 square feet. Finally, add up the square footage from the three living room walls, the two short bedroom walls, and the two long bedroom walls: 1200 square feet + 240 square feet + 200 square feet = 1640 square feet. The answer is 1640.

[Question]Jill makes scented candles as a hobby. Her favorite scents are lavender, coconut, and almond, and she uses the same amount of each scent for every candle. This time, she made twice as many lavender candles as coconut candles, along with a batch of almond candles. She ran out of almond scent after making ten candles. If she had one and a half times as much coconut scent as almond scent and used all her coconut scent up too, how many lavender candles did she make?
[Answer]Jill made one and a half times as many coconut candles as almond candles, so she made 10 * 1 1 / 2 = 15 coconut candles. She made twice as many lavender candles as coconut candles, so she made 2 * 15 = 30 lavender candles. The answer is 30.
Q: Lee wants to propose marriage to Sierra. He wants to follow the adage that you should spend two months' salary on the ring. He earns $60,000 per year in salary and can save $1000 per month. How long will it take before he can propose to Sierra?
A: Lee currently earns $60,000 / 12 months = $5,000 per month. The engagement ring will cost him 2 * $5,000 = $10,000. This means that it will take Lee $10,000 / $1,000 = 10 months to save enough money before he can propose. The answer is 10.
Question: Eric decides to go to the park. He runs for 20 minutes, then jogs for 10 minutes to reach the park. When he returns, he takes a different route home and this takes him 3 times as long as his trip there. How long does it take Eric to return home?
Answer: Ericâ€™s trip to the park took 20 minutes running + 10 minutes jogging = 30 minutes. So his return trip took 30 minutes * 3 = 90 minutes. The answer is 90.
