We are finishing the day with a short excursion through Tel Aviv and the ancient city of Jaffa.

Tel Aviv is a vibrant city located on the Mediterranean coast of Israel, known for its beautiful beaches, bustling nightlife, and rich cultural scene. It was founded in 1909 as a modern city on the outskirts of the ancient port city of Jaffa. Over the years, Tel Aviv has expanded and encompassed Jaffa, making it an inseparable part of the city's story. 

Our short excursion begins in Rabin Square, a large public square in the heart of Tel Aviv. Named in memory of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated here in 1995, the square is a center for gatherings, events, and protests. The square is surrounded by notable buildings like the Tel Aviv City Hall and the architecturally unique government complex known as "The Culture Square."

Next, we stroll down Rothschild Boulevard, a tree-lined avenue that features many caf√©s, restaurants, and shops, as well as some of Tel Aviv's most famous Bauhaus-style buildings. This architectural style, prevalent in Tel Aviv, has earned the city the nickname "The White City." Rothschild Boulevard is also the location of Independence Hall, where David Ben-Gurion declared the State of Israel in 1948.

Taking a brief detour from the bustling streets of Tel Aviv, we visit the peaceful Yitzhak Rabin Park, where you'll find lush lawns, scenic walking paths, and a picturesque pond. It's an ideal place to relax and take a moment to enjoy the diverse and vibrant cityscape around us.

As we approach the ancient city of Jaffa, the scenery changes from modern Tel Aviv's high-rises and urban landscape to a fascinating mix of old and new. Jaffa, one of the oldest port cities in the world, is steeped in history dating back thousands of years. Here, you can explore narrow streets, marvel at the well-preserved architecture, and enjoy breathtaking views of the Mediterranean Sea.

Our first stop in Jaffa is the historic port, where archeological excavations have unearthed evidence of a bustling harbor dating back to the Bronze Age. As we explore the port area, we'll learn about its significant role in ancient trade, the biblical story of Jonah and the whale, and other historical events that have shaped this fascinating city.

From the port, we continue to the famous Jaffa Clock Tower, built by the Ottoman Empire in 1903. It's one of several clock towers throughout Israel and serves as a symbol of the city's rich and diverse history.

The next attraction on our itinerary is St. Peter's Church, a centuries-old Franciscan church that commemorates the visit of Saint Peter to Jaffa. The church's impressive baroque architectural style and stunning artwork provide a serene atmosphere for prayer and reflection.

Finally, we conclude our short excursion with a visit to the Jaffa Flea Market, a lively and vibrant marketplace where you can find an assortment of antiques, vintage items, and modern treasures amongst the lively stalls and alleyways.

As the sun sets over the Mediterranean, we say goodbye to the ancient city of Jaffa and the modern marvel that is Tel Aviv, having enjoyed a fascinating journey through time and history, seasoned with a flavor of Israel's diverse and rich culture.
