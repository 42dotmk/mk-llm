Roman von Ungern-Sternberg's forces and the Transbaikal fought over the territory of Outer Mongolia during the chaotic period that followed the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent Russian Civil War.

To better understand the circumstances leading to this conflict, one must delve into the background of the involved parties and the historical context of the era.

Lieutenant General Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, a Baltic German-Russian noble and military leader, earned a reputation for his brutal, fanatic, and autocratic style. He served the Russian Empire during the First World War and later fought with the White Movement against the Bolshevik forces in the Russian Civil War. Due to the revolution's profound impact on Russia, its borders, and territories, the power vacuum created an ideal opportunity for ambitious forces to fight for control over various regions.

The Transbaikal, also known as Zabaykalsky Krai, is a vast region located in the Russian Far East, bordering Mongolia. In the wake of the Russian Revolution, the Transbaikal region became a hotbed of political unrest and a site of power struggle between various factions, including the White Movement, the Bolsheviks, and regional warlords seeking autonomy.

At the same time, the Bogd Khanate (Outer) Mongolia was established in 1911 after the fall of the Qing Dynasty in China. However, its autonomy was fragile due to the continuous influence exercised by both the Russian Empire and the Republic of China.

With the onset of the Russian Revolution, the situation in these territories became even more muddled. Ungern-Sternberg, who was serving in the Russian Civil War in Siberia as a part of the Asiatic Cavalry Division, eventually set his sights on Mongolia as a potential base for anti-Bolshevik operations. Additionally, he sought to reinstate the Bogd Khan's rule as Mongolian leaders had reached out to the White Movement for military assistance against Chinese forces that occupied parts of Mongolia in 1919. 

Ungern-Sternberg's forces clashed with the Transbaikal Cossacks throughout the border regions between Mongolia and the Transbaikal, including the Siberian border. The conflict intensified in 1920 as Ungern-Sternberg launched a series of military campaigns and successfully took control of much of Outer Mongolia, expelling the Chinese forces and reinstating the Mongolian ruler Bogd Khan in early 1921.

Despite this success, Ungern-Sternberg's harsh rule and unrealistic dreams of forming a pan-Mongolian Empire quickly led to his downfall. Soviet Russia, now under the rule of the Bolsheviks, supported a Mongolian communist movement called the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP). In mid-1921, a joint Soviet-Red Mongolian Army defeated Ungern-Sternberg's forces and ultimately led to his capture and execution.

In conclusion, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg's forces and the Transbaikal fought over the territory of Outer Mongolia during a tumultuous period of political upheaval and power struggle following the Russian Revolution. The shifting alliances and conflicting interests among the various actors, both regional and international, further exacerbated the situation, yielding a complex and violent conflict that pursued territorial control and political domination.
