[Question]Jeremy is driving 600 miles to visit his parents. His average speed for this trip is 50 miles per hour. Every two hours of driving, he makes a rest stop for 15 minutes. His car gets 18 miles per gallon of gas, and his gas indicator comes on when he's used 15 gallons, at which point he stops to refill, which takes 10 minutes. How long, in minutes, does he take to get to his parents' house, if he starts out with a full tank of gas?
[Answer]Jeremy is driving 600 miles, at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, so he will be driving for 600 miles / 50 miles per hour = 12 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 720 minutes. He makes a rest stop every 2 hours of driving, at 2, 4, 6, 8 & 10 hours in = 5 rest stops on the trips. Each rest stop takes 15 minutes so he will spend 5 rest stops * 15 minutes per rest stop = 75 minutes on rest stops. His car gets 18 miles to the gallon, and he stops to refill every 15 gallons, so he will stop to refill every 18 miles per gallon * 15 gallons = 270 miles. 600 miles / 270 miles per refuel = 2.22 refuels, so he'll only make 2 refuels during the trip. He will spend 2 refuels * 10 minute per refuel = 20 minutes refueling his car. In total he will take 720 minutes driving + 75 minutes resting + 20 minutes refueling = 815 minutes. The answer is 815.
Q: A choir splits into 3 groups for their performances. The first group has 25 members, and the second group has 30 members. The third group has the remaining members of the choir. If the choir overall has 70 members, how many members are in the third group?
A: There are 25 + 30 members = 55 members in the first two groups. This means the third group has 70 total members â€“ 55 members in the first two groups = 15 members. The answer is 15.
Question: Mr. Ha owns 5 more silver dollars than Mr. Phung. Mr. Phung has 16 more silver dollars than Mr. Chiu has. If Mr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars, how many silver dollars the three have in total?
Answer: Mr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars. If Mr. Phung has 16 more silver dollars than Mr. Chiu, then his total silver dollars is 56 + 16 = 72. The total number of silver dollars that Mr. Ha owns is 72 + 5 = 77. Combined, together they have 77 + 72 + 56 = 205 silver dollars. The answer is 205.
[Question]Ruth is counting the number of spots on her cow. The cow has 16 spots on its left side and three times that number plus 7 on its right side. How many spots does it have total?
[Answer]First multiply the number of spots on the left side by 3: 16 spots * 3 = 48 spots. Then add 7 to find the number of spots on the right side: 48 spots + 7 spots = 55 spots. Then add the number of spots on each side to find the total number of spots: 55 spots + 16 spots = 71 spots. The answer is 71.
Q: Lexi wants to run a total of three and one-fourth miles. One lap on a particular outdoor track measures a quarter of a mile around. How many complete laps must she run?
