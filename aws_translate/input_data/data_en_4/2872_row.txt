The most logical next event after selecting your tomatoes would be to prepare them for freezing. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you freeze tomatoes successfully:

Step 1: Clean the tomatoes
Before freezing, it is essential to clean your tomatoes thoroughly to remove any dirt, bacteria, or residue. Gently wash the tomatoes under running water and use a soft cloth or vegetable brush if necessary. After washing, dry them completely with a clean towel or paper towel to remove excess moisture.

Step 2: Blanch the tomatoes (optional)
Blanching is the process of boiling tomatoes for a short period followed by an immediate transfer to an ice-water bath. This step helps in making it easier to peel the skin off once they are frozen. To blanch tomatoes, follow the steps below:

1. Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil.
2. Cut a small "X" at the bottom of each tomato using a sharp knife. This will facilitate the peeling process after blanching.
3. Place the tomatoes in the boiling water for 30-60 seconds or until the skin starts to loosen.
4. Use a slotted spoon to quickly transfer the tomatoes to an ice water bath to halt the cooking process.
5. Once cooled, gently peel the skin off the tomatoes. If you prefer to leave the skin on, you can skip the blanching process.

Step 3: Remove stems and core the tomatoes
Using a small, sharp knife, carefully cut out the stem and core from the top of each tomato. This step ensures the removal of the tough and undesirable portions of the tomato.

Step 4: Cut the tomatoes (optional)
Depending on your preference and intended use, you can choose to freeze the tomatoes whole, halved, quartered, or chopped. Cut the tomatoes in the desired size and shape, and make sure to remove any excess seeds and juice. If you plan on using the tomatoes primarily for sauces or stews, you may consider crushing or pureeing them.

Step 5: Arrange tomatoes on a baking sheet
To prevent the tomatoes from sticking together when frozen, spread them out on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat in a single layer. Make sure the tomatoes are not touching to allow for even freezing.

Step 6: Pre-freeze the tomatoes
Place the baking sheet with tomatoes in the freezer for a few hours or until they are firm and solid. This process is known as flash freezing and helps in maintaining the quality and texture of tomatoes when defrosting.

Step 7: Transfer to airtight containers or freezer bags
Once the tomatoes have been pre-frozen, transfer them to airtight containers or heavy-duty freezer bags. Label the bags with the date, type of tomato, and any other relevant information. Ensure you squeeze out any excess air to prevent freezer burn and to save space.

Step 8: Store in the freezer
Place the airtight containers or freezer bags in the freezer. Frozen tomatoes can be stored for up to six months to a year, although it is recommended to use them within six months for optimal quality and flavor.

Now your tomatoes are ready to be frozen and used in a variety of dishes in the future. Remember, when defrosting and using the tomatoes, they may no longer have the firm texture that they had before freezing. Thus, frozen tomatoes are best used in cooked dishes such as sauces, stews, soups, or casseroles.
