Before the Arabs took control of Iraq in the 7th century, the region had a long and complex history under various empires and rulers. The quote you provided offers a partial view of the story by mentioning the Roman-Persian Wars and the Byzantine-Sassanian Wars; however, it does not capture the full historical context of the many civilizations that controlled Iraq before the Arabs.

1. Sumerians (circa 4500-1900 BCE): The Sumerians were one of the earliest civilizations to emerge in ancient Mesopotamia, a region that corresponds to modern-day Iraq. They created a complex system of city-states and developed advanced technologies and practices, such as writing (cuneiform script), agriculture, and mathematics.

2. Akkadians (circa 2334-2154 BCE): The Akkadian Empire, led by King Sargon of Akkad, succeeded the Sumerians by conquering the area and forming the first known empire in history. The Akkadian Empire extended its influence beyond Mesopotamia, reaching as far as the Levant and Iran.

3. Babylonians (circa 1894-539 BCE): The Babylonians were a Semitic people who established a powerful kingdom in Mesopotamia after the fall of the Akkadian Empire. Their most famous ruler, Hammurabi, is known for his law code that served as a basis for later legal systems. The Babylonians were succeeded by numerous other empires, such as the Assyrians, the Kassites, and eventually the Neo-Babylonian Empire, which fell to the Persians in 539 BCE.

4. Persians and Medes (539-331 BCE): The Achaemenid Persian Empire, founded by Cyrus the Great, conquered Babylon and incorporated Mesopotamia into their vast empire. The Achaemenids ruled Iraq until Alexander the Great and his Hellenistic forces defeated them in 331 BCE.

5. Seleucids (312-141 BCE): After the death of Alexander the Great, his empire was divided among his generals. Seleucus I Nicator established the Seleucid Empire, which at its height extended from Anatolia to Iran and included Iraq. The Seleucids fostered Hellenistic culture and ideas throughout the region.

6. Parthians (141 BCE-224 CE): The Parthian Empire eventually supplanted the Seleucids, occupying Iraq and becoming a significant power in the region. The Parthians were an Iranian people who maintained their empire by a system of vassal states and diplomacy. They engaged in several conflicts with the Roman Empire known as the Roman-Parthian Wars.

7. Sassanids (224-651 CE): The Sassanian Empire, founded by Ardashir I, emerged as a powerful Persian dynasty that controlled Iraq for several centuries before the Arab conquest. During their reign, the Sassanians were involved in conflicts with the Roman Empire and later the Byzantine Empire, known as the Roman-Persian Wars and Byzantine-Sassanid Wars respectively. The Sassanian Empire marked the last pre-Islamic Persian dynasty before the region was conquered by the Arab Muslims in the 7th century.

To summarize, while the quote you provided addresses the latter part of Iraq's pre-Arab history, it doesn't capture the entire context and the myriad of empires and civilizations that controlled and shaped Iraq prior to Arab conquest. From the Sumerians to the Sassanids, many powerful rulers left enduring legacies on the region's history, culture, and politics.
