The process of fossil formation consists of several stages, namely: the death of animals and plants in soft soil or mud, sedimentation and accumulation of materials over the remains, decomposition of organic matter, replacement of the remaining parts with minerals, and finally, the formation of a fossil. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that in a situation where animals and plants die in soft soil less often, there will be a consequential effect on the formation of fossils. This hypothesis has both direct and indirect effects on the fossil formation process.

Direct effects of the perturbation hypothesis:

The most significant direct effect of the perturbation hypothesis on the fossil formation process is the reduction in the number of potential fossils. When animals and plants die in soft soil less often, there are simply fewer remains available to become fossils. As a result, the overall probability of fossil formation decreases because the first and fundamental step in the process is diminished. 

Since sedimentation and accumulation of materials over the remains are directly associated with the initial deposition of the remains, a decrease in the number of organisms dying in soft soil will lead to less sediment covering their remains. This can result in a lowered chance of preservation and eventual fossilization. In turn, fewer fossils will be found compared to a scenario where more animals and plants die within soft sediments.

Indirect effects of the perturbation hypothesis:

The perturbation hypothesis can also lead to indirect effects on the fossil formation process. For instance, a reduced rate of animals and plants dying in soft soil may influence the ecological balance and competition between organisms. Over time, this can lead to shifts in species populations and characteristics, which might consequently be reflected in the available fossil record.

Additionally, a reduction in the number of organisms dying in soft sediment may indirectly affect the rate of sedimentation and accumulation of materials. In some cases, this can impede the natural burial and preservation processes necessary for fossil formation. As an alternative, remains might become exposed to predators, scavengers, or physical and chemical erosion, which could further impact the existing fossil record.

Furthermore, the perturbation hypothesis could have knock-on effects on the overall process of decomposition and replacement of the remaining parts with minerals. This could be primarily due to the changes in sedimentation rates or the availability of minerals required for the replacement process. Consequently, these alterations can have a substantial bearing on the quality and completeness of the fossils that are ultimately formed.

In summary, the perturbation hypothesis that supposes animals and plants die in soft soil less often has both direct and indirect impacts on the fossil formation process. Directly, it decreases the number of potential fossils, while indirectly, it can lead to a range of consequences, such as shifts in species populations, habitat characteristics, and the overall fossilization process. Therefore, a reduction in the number of organisms dying in soft soil can indeed lead to fewer fossils being formed.
