After Estonia regained its independence in 1991 following the collapse of the USSR, various Russian institutions and organizations were either removed, restructured, or had their influence significantly reduced during the following decade (1991-2001). The main reasons for this shift were Estonia's need to assert its distinct cultural and political identity and to break away from Soviet-era policies that had promoted Russification.

1. Military bases and installations: The presence of the Russian military in Estonia was a major concern for the newly independent nation. Between 1991 and 1994, a series of negotiations and agreements took place between Russia and Estonia that resulted in the withdrawal of Russian troops and the closure of military bases and installations in the country.

2. KGB presence: The KGB was the Soviet Union's main security agency, with considerable influence in Estonia during Soviet times. In the years following Estonia's independence, the organization's presence was eliminated, with former KGB operatives and informants being prosecuted or expelled from the country.

3. Political institutions: The Estonian Communist Party (EKP) had significant power under Soviet rule. After Estonia's independence, the EKP was disbanded and its properties and assets nationalized. In addition, the political landscape was reshaped through free and fair elections, which allowed for the formation of new political parties independent of direct Russian influence.

4. Russian-language schools: Under the Soviet Nationalisation Programme, Estonian schools were compelled to teach in Russian, effectively promoting Russification. In the 1990s, Estonia reformed its educational system, gradually reintroducing the Estonian language as the primary medium of instruction and reducing the presence of Russian-specific schools.

5. State administration and bureaucracy: During the Soviet era, positions in the Estonian state administration were frequently staffed by ethnic Russians or native Estonians loyal to the USSR. Following independence, strict citizenship and language requirements were implemented to reduce the influence of people with Soviet-era ties, resulting in a significant decrease in Russian presence within the Estonian bureaucracy.

6. State-owned enterprises: After Estonia's independence, the government began a process of privatization, selling off businesses that were previously owned and managed by the Soviet government. This eliminated Russian control over key sectors of the Estonian economy and encouraged investment from other nations.

7. Cultural institutions: Many cultural institutions heavily influenced by Russian policies and norms were either closed down or restructured after Estonia's independence. The government aimed to promote Estonian culture and history, reversing decades of Soviet-imposed Russification.

In summary, the decade following Estonia's reclaim of independence was marked by a concerted effort to reduce or eliminate Russian institutions and influences that had permeated the country during Soviet rule. This included the removal of Russian military presence, the restructuring of political and educational systems, and the promotion of Estonian culture and language at the expense of Russification.
