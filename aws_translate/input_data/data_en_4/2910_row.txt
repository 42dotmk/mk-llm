Question: For every white duck at the lake there are 5 fish. For every black duck there are 10 fish and for every multicolor duck there are 12 fish. Currently there are 3 white ducks, 7 black ducks and 6 multicolored ducks. How many fish are in the lake?
Answer: For every white duck there are 5 fish and there are 3 white ducks for a total of 5 * 3 = 15 fish. For every black duck there are 10 fish and there are 7 black ducks for a total of 10 * 7 = 70 fish. For every multicolored duck there are 12 fish and there are 6 multicolored ducks for a total of 12 * 6 = 72 fish. All total there are 15 + 70 + 72 = 157 fish in the lake. The answer is 157.
[Question]Thomas started saving for a car almost 2 years ago. For the first year, his weekly allowance was $50. In the second year, he got a job that pays $9 an hour at a coffee shop and worked 30 hours a week, so his parents discontinued his allowance. If the car he wants to buy is $15,000 and he spends $35 a week on himself, how much more money does Thomas need to buy the car by the end of the 2 years?
[Answer]There are 52 weeks in a year. For the first year, Thomas received 52 x 50 = $2600. In the second year, Thomas earned 9 x 30 = $270 a week. In a year, Thomas earned 52 x 270 = $14,040. The total for the two years is 14040 + 2600 = 16640. In 2 years, Thomas' weekly expenses amounted to $35 x (52 x 2) = $35 x 104 = $3640. By the end of 2 years, Thomas would have saved $16640 - $3640 = 13000. Thomas still needs $15,000 - 13000 = $2000. The answer is 2000.
Q: Ivory and Brayan are doing school projects with a tight deadline and have to stay up late to complete everything. They prepare coffee to help them stay focused. If Brayan drinks twice as much coffee as Ivory, and Brayan drinks 4 cups of coffee in an hour, calculate the total number of cups of coffee they drink together in 5 hours.
A: If Brayan drinks 4 cups of coffee in an hour, twice what Ivory drinks, then Ivory drinks 4 / 2 = 2 cups of coffee in an hour. Together, they drink 4 + 2 = 6 cups of coffee in an hour. After 5 hours, they will drink 5 * 6 = 30 cups of coffee together. The answer is 30.
Question: Charlotte, Lisa, and Patricia have a joint baseball collection. One of their friends is selling a rare baseball card for $100 on his website. Not wanting to miss such a rare opportunity, they have pooled all their money to buy the card. Patricia has $6. Lisa has five times Patricia’s money, but double Charlotte’s. How much more money do they require?
Answer: Since Patricia has 6 dollars, then Lisa has 6 * 5 = 30 dollars. Patricia’s money is double Charlotte’s, meaning that Charlotte has 30 / 2 = 15 dollars. Adding up all the money they have gives a total of 6 + 30 + 15 = 51 dollars. Since the rare card costs 100 dollars, the girls require an additional 100 - 51 = 49 dollars. The answer is 49.
