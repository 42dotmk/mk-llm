Remy, like many individuals who leave their rural homes for urban settings, could have made this decision due to a multitude of reasons. While I cannot speak for Remy's specific motivations without more context, I will provide a detailed list of potential factors that might have influenced his decision to move to the city.

1. Job opportunities: The city often offers more job opportunities and a wider range of industries compared to rural areas. Remy may have been seeking better employment prospects or career advancements that were unavailable on the farm. Urban settings also create a strong network of professionals, leading to greater collaboration and innovation opportunities.

2. Education: Access to higher education institutions is typically easier in cities, as they host several universities and vocational schools. If Remy was looking to pursue further studies or gain additional qualifications, moving closer to these establishments could have been an attractive incentive.

3. Better infrastructure and public services: In terms of transportation, healthcare, and municipal services, cities typically have better-funded and more comprehensive offerings. Remy may have been drawn to more reliable public transportation options, improved access to healthcare facilities, or the availability of various public programs and amenities.

4. Cultural attractions and entertainment: Cities often boast a rich array of cultural institutions, such as museums, theaters, and galleries. Additionally, the endless variety of restaurants, bars, clubs, and other entertainment venues can provide residents with numerous social opportunities and experiences. It is possible that Remy was seeking a more vibrant and engaging social life.

5. Diversity and cosmopolitanism: Cities attract residents from various backgrounds, forming multicultural and cosmopolitan communities. For someone like Remy who lived on a farm, the allure of meeting new people and learning about different cultures might have been a strong incentive to move.

6. Independence and personal growth: Leaving the familiarity of a rural environment and immersing oneself in an urban setting can provide opportunities for personal growth and self-discovery. Remy might have felt a strong desire to challenge himself and expand his horizons.

7. Fatigue from farm life: As you mentioned, Remy was tired of all the work on the farm. Farming involves long hours of hard, physical labor and can be both mentally and physically exhausting. Remy may have been seeking a change of pace and respite from the demands of farm work.

8. Family or social influence: Remy might have been influenced by friends, family, or loved ones who encouraged him to move to the city. Hearing about the experiences of others who have made a similar transition can often be a motivating factor.

In summary, there are several factors that could have influenced Remy's decision to move to the city, such as better job opportunities, education, modern infrastructure, cultural attractions, diversity, personal growth, exhaustion from farm work, or the encouragement of family and friends. It is likely that a combination of these elements played a role in shaping Remy's choice to leave the farm behind and seek a new life in the city.
