Question: Celina enjoys hiking in the mountains. Due to a lack of proper equipment, she decided to order a new pair of boots, a flashlight, and a special hoodie. The hoodie cost $80 and the flashlight was only 20% of that price. The pair of boots cost was $110, but due to a special promotion, Celina was able to buy them 10% cheaper. How much did Celina spend in total on the above-mentioned equipment?
Answer: The flashlight was 20% of the price of the hoodie, so 80 * 20 / 100 = $16. The promotion for a pair of boots was 110 * 10 / 100 = $11. So the pair of boots cost 110 - 11 = $99. Celina therefore spent 80 + 16 + 99 = $195 on the equipment. The answer is 195.
[Question]Sixteen boys and 14 girls attended Simon's birthday party. Three-fourths of the boys and 6/7 of the girls brought gifts. How many of those who attended did not bring gifts?
[Answer]16 x 3 / 4 = 12 boys brought gifts. So, 16 - 12 = 4 boys did not bring gifts. 14 x 6 / 7 = 12 girls brought gifts. So, 14 - 12 = 2 girls did not bring gifts. Therefore, a total of 4 boys + 2 girls = 6 people did not bring gifts. The answer is 6.
Q: Harry wants to build a homemade helium balloon with his son, Kevin, so he and Kevin go to the store with $200. They buy a giant sheet to turn into a balloon for $42, a rope for $18, and a propane tank and burner for $14. They plan to use the rest of the money on helium. The helium is $1.50 per ounce. For every ounce they buy, the balloon can fly 113 feet higher. How many feet up can they fly the balloon?
A: They have $126 for helium because 200 - 42 - 18 - 14 = 126. They can buy 84 ounces of helium because 126 / 1.5 = 84. They can fly 9,492 feet up because 84 x 113 = 9,492. The answer is 9492.
Question: Jane's mother agreed to pay her $.50 for every flower bulb that Jane planted. Jane planted 20 tulip bulbs and half that amount of iris bulbs. She also planted 30 daffodil bulbs and three times that amount of crocus bulbs. How much money did Jane earn?
Answer: 20 tulip bulbs at $.50 each is 20 * .50 $10.00. She planted half that amount of iris' so 20 / 2 = 10 bulbs. 10 iris bulbs at $.50 each is 10 * .50 = $5.00. 30 daffodil bulbs at $.50 each is 30 * .50 = $15.00. She planted three times that amount of crocus bulbs to 30 * 3 = 90 bulbs. 90 crocus bulbs at $.50 = $45.00. All total, she earned 10 + 5 + 15 + 45 = $75.00. The answer is 75.
[Question]A washing machine uses 20 gallons of water for a heavy wash, 10 gallons of water for a regular wash, and 2 gallons of water for a light wash per load of laundry. If bleach is used, there is an extra light wash cycle added to rinse the laundry thoroughly. There are two heavy washes, three regular washes, and one light wash to do. Two of the loads need to be bleached. How many gallons of water will be needed?
[Answer]The two heavy washes will use 20 * 2 = 40 gallons of water. The three regular washes will use 10 * 3 = 30 gallons of water. The light wash will use 2 * 1 = 2 gallons of water. The two bleached loads will use an extra 2 * 2 = 4 gallons of water. In all, 40 + 30 + 2 + 4 = 76 gallons of water will be needed. The answer is 76.
