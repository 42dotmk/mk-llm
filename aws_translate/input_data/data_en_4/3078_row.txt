[Question]I caught 4 fewer fish than the number in my tank and added them to my fish tank. If the tank has 20 fish right now, how many did I add?
[Answer]Let's say the number of fish that was in the tank before was x. If you caught 4 fewer fish than the number that was there, then you caught x - 4. After adding x - 4 fish into the tank, the tank now had 20 fish, meaning the total number of fish in the tank is x + x - 4 = 20. 2x = 20 + 4. The total number of fish that was initially in the tank is 2x = 24. Initially, there were x = 24 / 2 fish in the tank. x = 12. If you caught 4 fewer fish than the number in my tank initially, you caught 12 - 4 = 8 fish. The answer is 8.
Q: Ruby was going to order pizza for dinner. Her son would only eat pepperoni pizza. Her daughter would only eat sausage. Ruby and her husband wanted black olive and mushroom pizza. To make life easy, Ruby decided to order an entire pizza for each of her children and she would split one with her husband. The pizza restaurant charged $10.00 per pizza and $1.00 per topping. She also needed to add a $5.00 tip. Including tip, how much would the pizza order cost?
A: Ruby was going to order 1 for her son, 1 for her daughter and 1 to share with her husband. So she needed to order 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 pizzas. Each pizza cost $10 and she was ordering 3 so that comes to 10 * 3 = $30.00. She needed to order pepperoni, sausage, black olive and mushroom, which came to 4 toppings at $1.00 each so 4 * 1 = $4.00 extra for toppings. The pizzas cost $30 and $4 for the toppings so the total costs of the pizzas came to 30 + 4 = $34.00. She also had to add a $5.00 tip to her current order total of $34.00 so 5 + 34.00 = $39.00 for the total order. The answer is 39.
Question: Rollo has 3 guinea pigs, the first guinea pig eats 2 cups of food, the second guinea pig eats twice as much as the first one, and the third guinea pig eats 3 cups more than the second one. How many cups of food does Rollo need to feed all his Guinea pigs?
Answer: The second guinea pig eats 2 x 2 = 4 cups of food. The third guinea pig eats 4 + 3 = 7 cups of food. Therefore, Rollo needs a total of 2 + 4 + 7 = 13 cups of food for the guinea pig. The answer is 13.
[Question]How long is it before Kayla can reach the minimum age of driving of her state, which is 18, if she is currently half the age of her sister Kimiko who is 26 years old?
[Answer]If Kimiko is 26 years old, Kayla, who is half her age, is 26 / 2 = 13 years old. Sine the minimum driving age is 18, Kayla will have to wait for 18 - 13 = 5 more years to start driving. The answer is 5.
Q: While practising for his upcoming math exams, Hayes realised that the area of a circle he had just solved was equal to the perimeter of a square he had solved in the previous problem. If the area of the circle was 100, what's the length of one side of the square?
A: Let's say the side of a square is s.To get the perimeter of a square, you add all the sides, which is s + s + s + s = 100. Therefore, 4s = 100. Therefore one side of the square is s = 100 / 4 = 25. The answer is 25.
