The original statement discusses the intention of not limiting or interfering with the granted authority in the context of legislative development, rule-making, or discretionary policy-making within an agency. However, there appears to be a concern or suggestion that there might be interference happening in a cunning or subtle manner in the latter part of the statement, "They were really slye about interfering though."

To fully address this question, it is vital to analyze the nature of the alleged interference and its effects on the overall functioning of the concerned agency. The term "slye" indicates a sense of sneakiness or deceit, suggesting that the actions causing the interference may be covert in nature and difficult to detect. To analyze the situation, several areas need to be considered:

1. Legal Framework: It is essential to evaluate existing laws, policies, and regulations governing the agency's functioning. These rules would typically define the boundaries within which interference occurs and help identify if any such interfering activities are truly taking place. It is crucial to determine whether any actions that deviate from the established norms are legally authorized or not.

2. Stakeholders: Interference could arise from multiple sources, both internal and external to the agency. It is crucial to analyze the stakeholders involved in the decision-making processes, their motivations, and interests. This would help establish any conflicts of interest or ulterior motives that could be contributing to the alleged interference.

3. Impact on Functions: To prove interference, one must determine whether the sly actions have had any discernable effect on the legislative, rule-making, or policy-making capabilities of the agency. If such a negative impact can be demonstrated, it lends credence to the claim of interference. It would be vital to evaluate the outcomes of the concerned agencyâ€™s programs, projects, or policies and how they deviate from their original purpose due to interference.

4. Accountability and Oversight: A key factor in identifying and remedying potential interference in an agency's operations is having a robust system of accountability and oversight. This includes transparency, regular audits, and balanced decision-making authority to avoid centralized control. It is vital that the agency concerned adheres to these principles to minimize the chances of interference going unnoticed.

5. Remedial Measures: If it is evident that there is sly interference occurring, appropriate remedial measures should be taken to address the situation. This may involve reshuffling or restructuring the agency's decision-making authority, revisiting policies and procedures, or even seeking legal redress.

In conclusion, while the statement, "They were really slye about interfering though," raises concerns about potential interference in an agency's legislative or policy-making processes, a thorough investigation into the aspects mentioned above is necessary to substantiate these claims. By evaluating the legal framework, stakeholders, impacts on functions, accountability, and oversight systems in place, any possible interference may be detected, and appropriate remedial measures can be undertaken to safeguard the agency's mandate.
