Q: Jacob takes four tests in his physics class and earns 85, 79, 92 and 84. What must he earn on his fifth and final test to have an overall average of 85?
A: Since wants needs an 85 as an average and he takes five tests, he must have 85 * 5 = 425 total points. Currently he has 85 + 79 + 92 + 84 = 340 points. So for his fifth test he needs 425 - 340 = 85 points. The answer is 85.

[Question]Bill milked his cow and got 16 gallons of milk. He turned 1/4 into sour cream, 1/4 into butter, and kept the rest as whole milk. It takes 4 gallons of milk to make one gallon of butter and 2 gallons of milk to make 1 gallon of sour cream. If Bill sells butter for $5/gallon, sour cream for $6/gallon, and whole milk for $3/gallon, how much money does he make?
[Answer]First find how much milk Bill turned into sour cream and butter: 16 gallons * 1 / 4 = 4 gallons. Then find how many gallons of butter he makes out of 4 gallons of milk: 4 gallons milk / 4 gallons milk / 1 gallon butter = 1 gallon butter. Then find how many gallons of sour cream he makes out of 4 gallons of milk: 4 gallons milk / 2 gallons milk / 1 gallon sour cream = 2 gallon sour cream. Then subtract the amount of milk turned into butter and sour cream to find the remaining amount of whole milk: 16 gallons - 4 gallons - 4 gallons = 8 gallons. Then multiply the number of gallons of milk by the price of milk to find the total cost of the milk: 8 gallons * $3 / gallon = $24. Then multiply the number of gallons of sour cream by the price of sour cream to find the total cost of the sour cream: 2 gallons * $6 / gallon = $12. Then add the cost of the butter, sour cream and milk to find the total amount of money Bill earns: $24 + $12 + $5 = $41. The answer is 41.
Q: Mitch has saved $20000 to finance his boating hobby. A new boat costs $1500 per foot in length. If Mitch needs to keep $500 for a license and registration, and three times that amount for docking fees, how many feet is the longest boat he can buy?
A: Mitch needs to keep 500 * 3 = 1500 for docking fees. Thus, he needs to keep 500 + 3 * 500 = $2000 for license, registration, and docking fees. He has 20000 - 2000 = $18000 left to spend on a boat. Therefore, the longest boat he can buy is 18000 / 1500 = 12 feet long. The answer is 12.
Question: Georgie is a varsity player on a football team. He can run 40 yards within 5 seconds. If he can improve his speed by forty percent, how many yards will he be able to run within 10 seconds?
Answer: The additional yard he will be able to run to after improving his speed is 40 x 40 / 100 = 16 yards. So the total yard he will be able to run to after improving his speed is 40 + 16 = 56 yards in 5 seconds. Therefore the total yards he will be able to run to within 10 seconds is 56 x 2 = 112. The answer is 112.
