Q: In January, Bill's labrador puppy weighs 40 pounds and his dachshund puppy weighs 12 pounds. Each dog gains 25% of their starting weight over the year. What's the difference in their weight at the end of the year?
A: First find how much weight the labrador puppy gains: 40 pounds * 25% = 10 pounds. Then add that weight gain to the puppy's starting weight: 40 pounds + 10 pounds = 50 pounds. Then find how much weight the dachshund puppy gains: 12 pounds * 25% = 3 pounds. Then add that weight gain to the puppy's starting weight: 12 pounds + 3 pounds = 15 pounds. Then subtract the dachshund puppy's weight from the labrador puppy's weight to find the difference: 50 pounds - 15 pounds = 35 pounds. The answer is 35.
Question: Jade is building a lego tower. She has 100 pieces. Each level has to be 7 pieces wide. If she has 23 pieces left at the end, how many levels is her tower?
Answer: She used 77 legos because 100 - 23 = 77. She made 11 levels because 77 / 7 = 11. The answer is 11.
[Question]Kim is an office manager. Every morning she spends 5 minutes making coffee, 2 minutes per employee getting a status update, and 3 minutes per employee updating payroll records. If there are 9 employees in the office, how long does Kim's morning routine take?
[Answer]First find how many minutes Kim spends on each employee: 2 minutes / employee + 3 minutes / employee = 5 minutes / employee. Then multiply that time by the number of employees to find the total time spent on status and payroll updates: 5 minutes / employee * 9 employees = 45 minutes. Finally, add that time to the time spent making coffee to find the total time: 45 minutes + 5 minutes = 50 minutes. The answer is 50.
Q: Kimberly loves gumballs and will trade almost anything she owns for them. A friend knows that Kim has a bunch of shiny new earrings that she loves. She agrees to give Kim 9 gumballs for each pair of earrings. On the first day, Kim brings her 3 pairs of earrings. On the second she brings her twice as many. On the third day, she brings 1 less than she brought on the second day. If Kim eats 3 gumballs a day, how many days will the gumballs last?
A: On day 2 Kim trades 6 earrings because 3 x 2 = 6. On day 3 Kim trades 5 earrings because 6 - 1 = 5. In total she trades 14 pairs of earrings because 3 + 6 + 5 = 14. She trades these for 126 gum - balls because 14 x 9 = 126. These last her 42 days because 126 / 3 = 42. The answer is 42.
Question: Manny has a tree that grows at the rate of fifty centimeters every two weeks. If the tree is currently 2 meters tall, how tall, in centimeters, will the tree be in 4 months?
Answer: A month has four weeks, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 weeks in four months. Since the tree grows for five centimeters every two weeks, it will grow by fifty centimeters every week for 16 / 2 = 8 weeks. The tree will increase in height by 8 * 50 = 400 centimeters after four months. Since 1 meter equals 100 centimeters, the tree is currently 2 * 100 = 200 centimeters tall. After growing by 400 centimeters for four months, the tree will be 400 + 200 = 600 centimeters tall. The answer is 600.
