[Question]Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?
[Answer]Let S be the amount Alexis paid for the shoes. She spent S + 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 = S + 143. She used all but $16 of her budget, so S + 143 = 200 - 16 = 184. Thus, Alexis paid S = 184 - 143 = $41 for the shoes. The answer is 41.
Q: Keenan needs to write an essay that is 1200 words. Her essay is due at midnight. She writes 400 words per hour for the first two hours. After that, she writes 200 words per hour. How many hours before the deadline does she need to start to finish on time?
A: In the first two hours, Keenan writes 800 words because 400 * 2 = 800. After that, she still needs to write 400 words because 1200 - 800 = 400. Since she writes 200 words per hour, she will take 2 hours to write the last 400 words because 400 / 200 = 2. Thus, she needs to start 4 hours before the deadline because 2 + 2 = 4. The answer is 4.
Question: The music festival of Bassompierre begins tonight with a concert by the string orchestra "PIANISSIMO". The ticket price for adults is $26; for children, the price is half. The show starts at 9 pm and goes very well. At about 11:00 pm, the concert organizer made his accounts. There were 183 adults and 28 children who attended the show. What was the total revenue of the concert?
Answer: The total revenue from the adults is 183 x $26 = $4758. The ticket price for children is $26 / 2 = $13. The total revenue from the children is 28 x $13 = $364. The total revenue of the concert is $4758 + $364 = $5122. The answer is 5122.
[Question]John and Sam were hungry so they ordered an extra-large pizza that was pre-sliced into 12 pieces. John ate 3 slices while Sam ate twice the amount that John ate. How many slices of pizza were left?
[Answer]Sam had twice the amount of John so Sam ate 3 * 2 = 6 slices. Together, they ate 3 + 6 = 9 slices. 1 pizza has 12 slices. 9 slices were eaten so 12 - 9 = 3 slices left. The answer is 3.
Q: The fifth grade class at Rosa Parks Elementary School is holding a food drive. Half the students in Ms. Perez's class collected 12 cans each, two students didn't collect any, and the remaining 13 students students each collected 4 cans. If Ms. Perez's class has 30 students, how many cans did they collect total?
A: Then find how many students in Ms. Perez's class collected 12 cans each: 30 students / 2 = 15 students. Then find how many cans the students who collected 12 cans each collected in total: 15 students * 12 cans / student = 180 cans. Then find how many cans the students who collected 4 cans each collected in total: 13 students * 4 cans / student = 52 cans. Then add both amounts of cans to find the total: 180 cans + 52 cans = 232 cans. The answer is 232.
