Aubrey's journey of baking too many cookies while experimenting with various recipes can be attributed to several factors that revolve around her personal interests, exposure to new recipes, development of baking skills, and potential emotional triggers. We can break down and analyze these reasons to understand her actions better, which eventually resulted in her having to consume cookies every night for a while.

1. Personal interests and hobbies: Aubrey might be passionate about baking and trying out different recipes. For some people, the kitchen serves as a creative and therapeutic space where they can unwind, relax, and express themselves through the art of baking. As a home cook, Aubrey could be indulging in her curiosity for exploring different ingredients, flavor combinations, and developing a wide array of baking techniques. This enthusiasm for baking drove her to make an excess of cookies.

2. Skill enhancement and practice: It is often said that "practice makes perfect." Aubrey might have been working on improving her baking skills by making a variety of cookies, and as such, continued baking to ensure she gained valuable hands-on experience. It's possible that she utilized different recipes as a way to broaden her knowledge, refine her skills, and become adept in the art of cookie-making. This quest for perfection and the need to experiment and fine-tune her skills could have led her to bake more cookies than necessary.

3. Exposure to new recipes: In today's digital age, a plethora of recipes is available at our fingertips. Aubrey could have stumbled upon a goldmine of cookie recipes through social media, food blogs, cooking shows, or cookbooks. The exposure to these new recipes may have piqued her curiosity and excitement, propelling her to try each one to compare and contrast the final products. The desire to taste and analyze these different recipes might have led Aubrey to bake more cookies than she could consume in a reasonable time frame.

4. Emotional triggers and stress relief: Baking is often considered a stress-relieving activity that many people turn to when dealing with challenges or seeking a mental break from daily life. Aubrey may have been experiencing emotional triggers or stressors that led her to seek solace and comfort in the kitchen. In such situations, baking an excessive amount of cookies might have served as a coping mechanism, providing her with a sense of accomplishment and control while also allowing her to channel her energy into a creative and constructive outlet.

5. Socializing and sharing: Aubrey might have initially baked the cookies with the intention of sharing them with friends, family, or colleagues. Sharing homemade baked goods is a way for people to connect and build relationships with others. However, plans might have changed, or perhaps she didn't find the opportunity to share the cookies as initially expected, which left her with an overwhelming amount of cookies to consume on her own.

In conclusion, a combination of personal interests, skill development, exposure to new recipes, emotional triggers, and socializing intentions could have motivated Aubrey to bake an excessive amount of cookies, resulting in her need to consume them every night for a while.
