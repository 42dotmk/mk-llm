No, it does not follow that "The unions were never taken care of by the government." The statement given states that the government cleaned up the unions, which implies that the government had indeed taken measures to address the issue of Mafia control within those unions. However, it is important to look at the historical context and understand the various actions taken by the government to tackle the Mafia's influence on these unions.

In the early and mid-20th century, organized crime groups, such as the Mafia, penetrated various sectors of the American economy, including labor unions. The Mafia exploited these unions to further their criminal activities, such as money laundering, racketeering, and extortion. In some cases, the criminal organizations formed alliances with corrupt union officials to gain control over entire unions.

Recognizing the need to address the Mafia's influence on unions, the United States government initiated various investigations and measures to curb the Mafia's infiltration. The establishment of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act in 1970 was a significant milestone in the government's efforts to dismantle organized crime in the US, not only in unions but in other sectors as well. The RICO Act provided the legal framework to prosecute those involved in racketeering and infiltration of legitimate organizations, including labor unions.

Starting from the 1980s, several high-profile cases were brought against organized crime figures and corrupt union officials under the RICO Act. For instance, in the 1980s, the government successfully prosecuted the leaders of the five major Mafia families in New York City, leading to a severe blow to organized crime's hold over many labor unions.

Moreover, in 1989, the Teamsters union, which was once under the control of the Mafia, was placed under a consent decree with the government. This decree resulted in the implementation of democratic reforms within the union, the appointment of independent monitors, and the removal of organized crime influence from the union's leadership. The transformation of the Teamsters union is an example of the government's efforts to address the issue of Mafia control over labor unions in the US.

Furthermore, other measures, such as the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) of 1959, also known as the Landrum-Griffin Act, aimed to combat corruption and promote transparency within labor unions. The Landrum-Griffin Act established guidelines for the reporting of financial transactions within labor organizations and increased oversight over union activities.

Taking into account the various efforts made by the government to address the Mafia's influence on labor unions from the 1950s up to the 1980s, it is evident that the government did indeed take action to clean up the unions. While it is true that the problem of Mafia control persisted through the mid-1980s, the government's efforts eventually led to significant progress in dismantling the Mafia's grip on labor unions. As a result, it does not follow that "The unions were never taken care of by the government." Instead, it is more accurate to state that the government took steps to address the problem and achieved significant success over time.
