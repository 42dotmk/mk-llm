Q: In a game, Samanta has 8 more points than Mark, and Mark has 50% more points than Eric. Eric has 6 points. How many points do Samanta, Mark, and Eric have in total?
A: Mark has 50 / 100 * 6 = 3 points more than Eric. So Mark has 6 + 3 = 9 points. That means Samanta has 9 + 8 = 17 points. So in total Samanta, Mark, and Eric have 6 + 9 + 17 = 32 points. The answer is 32.
Question: Every time she goes to the store, Felicity gets a lollipop. After she finishes them, she uses the sticks to build a fort. The fort needs 400 sticks to finish it. Her family goes to the store three times a week and she always goes. If the fort is 60% complete, how many weeks has Felicity been collecting lollipops for?
Answer: She has 240 sticks because 400 x .6 = 240. She has been going to the store for 80 weeks because 240 / 3 = 80. The answer is 80.
[Question]Janet is trying to decide whether to quit her job and start freelancing. She works 40 hours a week at both jobs. She get paid $30/hour at her current job, and would get paid $40/hour as a freelancer. However, she'd have to pay an extra $25 a week in FICA taxes plus $400/month in healthcare premiums. How much more would Janet make per month as a freelancer if there are four weeks in a month?
[Answer]First find the difference in hourly wages: $40 / hour - $30 / hour = $10 / hour. Then multiply that difference by the number of hours she works in a week to find the weekly difference: $10 / hour * 40 hours / week = $400 / week. Then multiply that amount by the number of weeks in a month to find the monthly difference in her earnings: $400 / week * 4 weeks / month = $1600 / month. Then find the total additional amount Janet pays in FICA taxes: $25 / week * 4 weeks / month = $100 / month. Then subtract Janet's extra FICA taxes and healthcare premium from the additional money she earns to find the net increase in her pay from freelancing: $1600 / month - $400 / month - $100 / month = $1100 / month. The answer is 1100.
Q: Dorothy sells glass frames at half the price that Jemma sells them. Jemma sells the glass frames at 5 dollars each, selling twice as many frames as Dorothy does. If Jemma sold 400 frames, how much did they make together in total from the sale of the glass frames?
A: If Jemma sold 400 glasses frames at $5 each, she made 400 * $5 = $2000. Jemma sold twice as many frames as Dorothy, meaning Dorothy sold 400 / 2 = 200 frames. If Dorothy sold her glasses frames at half the price that Jemma sold hers, then it means she sold her glasses frames at $5 / 2 = $2.5 per glasses frame. In total, Dorothy made $2.5 * 200 = $500 from the sale of her glasses frames. Together, they made $2000 + $500 = $2500 from the sale of the glasses frames. The answer is 2500.
Question: Bob and Jim decide to skip rocks. Bob can skip a rock 12 times. Jim can skip a rock 15 times. If they each skipped 10 rocks how many total skips did they get?
