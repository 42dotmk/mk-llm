[Question]Leila and her friends want to rent a car for their one-day trip that is 150 kilometers long each way. The first option for a car rental costs $50 a day, excluding gasoline. The second option costs $90 a day including gasoline. A liter of gasoline can cover 15 kilometers and costs $0.90 per liter. Their car rental will need to carry them to and from their destination. How much will they save if they will choose the first option rather than the second one?
[Answer]Leila and her friends will travel a total distance of 150 x 2 = 300 kilometers back - and - forth. They will need 300 / 15 = 20 liters of gasoline for this trip. So, they will pay $0.90 x 20 = $18 for the gasoline. Thus, the first option will costs them $50 + $18 = $68. Therefore, they can save $90 - $68 = $22 if they choose the first option. The answer is 22.
Q: Karen is a dog groomer. Rottweilers take 20 minutes to groom, border collies take 10 minutes to groom, and chihuahuas take 45 minutes to groom because they ferociously resist. How many minutes will it take Karen to groom 6 Rottweilers, 9 border collies and 1 chihuahua?
A: First find the total time Karen spending grooming Rottweilers: 20 minutes / Rottweiler * 6 Rottweilers = 120 minutes. Then find the total time she spends grooming border collies: 10 minutes / border collie * 9 border collies = 90 minutes. Then add the time spent grooming all three kinds of dogs to find her total grooming time: 120 minutes + 90 minutes + 45 minutes = 255 minutes. The answer is 255.
Question: Johnson has a sack of potatoes. He gives Gina 69 potatoes, gives Tom twice as much potatoes as he gave Gina and gives one-third of the amount of potatoes he gave Tom to Anne. How many potatoes does he have left if the sack contains 300 potatoes?
Answer: He gives twice 69 potatoes to Tom, which is 69 * 2 = 138 potatoes. He gives one - third of 138 potatoes to Anne, which is 138 * (1 / 3) = 46 potatoes. In total, he has given out 69 + 138 + 46 = 253 potatoes. He initially had 300 potatoes so he now has 300 - 253 = 47 potatoes left. The answer is 47.
[Question]Matthew asked his children how many hotdogs they wanted for dinner. Both Ella and Emma agreed they wanted 2 hotdogs each. Luke said he could eat twice the amount of hotdogs as his sisters while Hunter said he could only eat 1 and half times the total amount of his sisters. How many hotdogs did Matthew need to cook?
[Answer]Ella wanted 2 while Emma wanted 2 so 2 + 2 = 4 hotdogs. Luke could eat twice as his sisters so 2 * 2 = 4 hotdogs. Hunter could eat 1 1 / 2 times the amount of his sisters so 1.5 * 4 = 6 hotdogs. All total, Matthew needs to cook, 4 + 4 + 6 = 18 hot dogs. The answer is 14.
