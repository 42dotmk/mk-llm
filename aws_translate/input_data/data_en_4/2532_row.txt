B). Kyle had grown up rich.

Being born into a wealthy family had provided Kyle with many benefits. He had attended the best schools, had access to the finest tutors, and never had to worry about financial stability. While these privileges had certainly made life easier for him in many ways, they also presented their own set of challenges. As a result, Neil's upbringing in a more modest environment often allowed him to approach life and problems differently than Kyle.

Neil, on the other hand, had grown up in a middle-class family. He had a close relationship with his parents and siblings, who all understood the value of hard work and perseverance. His parents had taught him to appreciate every opportunity he was given, especially when it came to his education. They had not been able to give Neil everything he wanted, but they had instilled in him the importance of working for what he desired.

Step 1: Show the contrast between Neil and Kyle's upbringing.

Despite their different backgrounds, Neil and Kyle had become friends in college. They had bonded over their shared love for sports and found that they could learn a lot from one another. Neil taught Kyle how to be more grounded and practical with his decisions, while Kyle shared his perspective on risk-taking and seizing opportunities.

Step 2: Establish their friendship and how they contribute to each other's growth.

One day, as they walked through the park, Kyle confided in Neil about his recent troubles at the family business. The company had been facing a financial setback, and Kyle's father had tasked him with finding a solution. Feeling overwhelmed, Kyle was unsure how to handle the situation.

Step 3: Introduce a conflict that brings their different perspectives into play.

Neil listened attentively and then offered some practical advice. He suggested Kyle conduct thorough research into the company's expenses, revenue, and competitors to gain a better understanding of what was causing the financial problems. Furthermore, Neil recommended that Kyle consult with his father and experienced colleagues to gather their insights and devise a plan together.

Step 4: Show how Neil's upbringing influences his advice to Kyle.

Kyle seemed genuinely appreciative of Neil's guidance, realizing that his initial inclination had been to throw money at the problem in hopes of a quick fix. Instead, he decided to take Neil's advice to heart and work toward a more sustainable and well-informed solution.

Step 5: Demonstrate Kyle's growth and their friendship's positive influence.

In the end, Kyle was able to devise a strategic plan that addressed the company's financial issues and set it on a path toward long-term stability. His friendship with Neil had not only given him valuable insights into problem-solving but also deepened his appreciation for the struggles that others faced. Neil, in turn, had learned from Kyle that sometimes taking calculated risks can lead to great rewards. The two friends continued to support and learn from one another, often referencing their contrasting upbringings as a source of strength and knowledge.

Step 6: Conclude with the positive outcomes of their friendship and how their different backgrounds enriched each other's lives.
