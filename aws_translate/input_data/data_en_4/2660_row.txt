When providing proof that other family members are dependent on you or that there are serious health grounds requiring you to take personal care of them, it is essential to gather and submit relevant documentation that adequately demonstrates this claim. Below is a list of suggested documents and evidence that can help establish dependency or health-related concerns:

1. Financial dependency:
   a. Bank statements showing regular financial support provided by you to your dependent family members.
   b. Money transfer receipts or transaction records reflecting the financial assistance provided.
   c. Proof of shared living expenses, such as utility bills, rent receipts, or mortgage statements, with both your name and the dependent family member's name.
   d. A signed affidavit from the dependent family member confirming financial support received from you.

2. Parent-child relationship (for dependent children):
   a. Birth certificate or adoption papers to establish the parent-child relationship.
   b. Custody agreements or court orders stating your responsibility for the child's care and upbringing.
   c. School enrollment records showing the child's residence with you or being under your care.

3. Spousal dependency (for dependent spouses):
   a. Marriage certificate or other proof of your legal relationship.
   b. Joint financial records, such as bank accounts or tax returns, showing shared financial responsibilities.

4. Dependency due to disability or serious health condition:
   a. Medical records confirming the family member's disability or medical condition and the need for personal care.
   b. A letter from a healthcare professional outlining the family member's health condition and care requirements, as well as your role in providing that care.
   c. Records of any assistance received from public or private support services, such as disability benefits, personal care attendants, or home health aides, indicating the need for additional support from you.

5. Dependency due to the age of family members:
   a. Birth certificate or legal documentation confirming the age of the dependent family member.
   b. Records of any age-based public programs or services they engage with, such as retirement benefits or senior housing arrangements, to demonstrate dependency.

6. Proof of cohabitation and shared responsibility for dependents (for non-married partners, siblings, or other family members):
   a. Rental agreements, mortgage statements, or utility bills with both your name and the dependent family member's name.
   b. Affidavit from a third party, such as a landlord or neighbor, confirming both individuals live together and share responsibilities for one another.
   c. Records of shared financial accounts or property ownership demonstrating joint responsibility and dependency.

Remember to verify specific requirements for documenting dependency and health grounds with the relevant authorities or government agencies, as these may vary based on your specific situation and jurisdiction. Providing comprehensive and well-documented evidence of your relationship and support for dependent family members will greatly enhance the credibility of your claim and increase the likelihood of achieving a positive outcome.
