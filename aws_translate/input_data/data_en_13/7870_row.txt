Several individuals and religious movements helped make Evangelicalism more popular. Overall, Evangelicalism became more widespread in the 18th and 19th centuries due to the rise of Methodism and the Great Awakenings in Britain and North America. Key figures and groups contributing to the growth of this religious movement include:

1. John Wesley: Wesley was an English cleric, theologian, and one of the founding fathers of Methodism. His preaching and theology focused on the importance of personal faith, holiness, and the love of God. He organized many Methodist societies throughout Britain and North America, and these societies eventually grew into the Methodist Church.

2. George Whitefield: Another prominent figure in the Methodist movement, Whitefield was an Anglican minister and evangelist who preached throughout Britain and the American colonies during the 18th century. His passionate and compelling sermons helped to attract large audiences and convert many to Evangelical faith.

3. Jonathan Edwards: Edwards was an influential preacher, philosopher, and theologian during the First Great Awakening in North America. His sermons emphasized the need for personal religious experience and the sovereignty of God. His legacy remains significant in shaping the theological foundation of Evangelicalism.

4. Nicolaus Zinzendorf: Zinzendorf was a German religious leader who founded the Moravian Church, another important early influence on Evangelicalism. He emphasized the importance of devout, personal piety, and his followers became some of the earliest Protestant missionaries, spreading their faith across Europe and the Americas.

5. Lutheran Pietism: This movement within Lutheran theology emphasized the importance of personal faith, good works, and spiritual renewal. Key figures within this movement, such as Philipp Jakob Spener and August Hermann Francke, played a major role in shaping the course of Evangelicalism in Europe.

6. Presbyterianism and Puritanism: These distinct but related Protestant movements in Britain and North America gave rise to various strands of Evangelical theology. Calvinist thought from these movements helped to shape the doctrine and practice of Evangelical churches.

7. Billy Graham: An American Christian evangelist, Graham is among the most influential Evangelical leaders of the 20th century. His large-scale evangelistic crusades attracted millions, and through his extensive ministry work, he significantly contributed to the global expansion of Evangelicalism.

8. Harold John Ockenga: Ockenga was an American pastor and theologian who played a significant role in shaping modern Evangelicalism during the 20th century. He helped to define the movement's core beliefs and was instrumental in founding key institutions like Fuller Theological Seminary and the National Association of Evangelicals.

9. John Stott: As an English Anglican cleric and scholar, Stott contributed to the global Evangelical movement through his numerous theological writings and leadership within the Evangelical community. His work helped clarify Evangelical positions on social and ethical issues.

10. Martyn Lloyd-Jones: A prominent Evangelical preacher from Wales, Lloyd-Jones's lengthy ministry and numerous published works helped to shape modern Evangelical theology and practice.

In conclusion, the popularity of Evangelicalism grew significantly through the concerted efforts and influence of several individuals and religious movements, ranging from the Methodist leaders John Wesley and George Whitefield to the Puritan preacher Jonathan Edwards to the 20th-century evangelist Billy Graham. Each of these figures and movements made a unique and significant contribution to the expansion and shaping of Evangelical faith.
