While questions 1 and 2 appear similar, they are not exactly the same thing. Question 1 focuses on the preparation aspects for CAT 2017, whereas question 2 emphasizes the strategy to be implemented for CAT 2017. Let me provide detailed answers to both questions for better clarity:

Question 1: How can I prepare for CAT 2017?

To prepare for CAT 2017, consider the following approach:

1. Understand the CAT exam pattern and syllabus: The first step is to familiarize yourself with the exam pattern and syllabus. CAT comprises three sections: Verbal and Reading Comprehension (VARC), Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DILR), and Quantitative Aptitude (QA). Knowing the type of questions and topics will help you strategize effectively.

2. Develop a study plan: Dedicate a fixed number of hours daily to preparing for each section. Divide your available time between concept building, practice, and revision. Allocate more time to your weak areas and keep revisiting your strong areas.

3. Self-assessment: Take regular mock tests and assess your performance. Mock tests will also help you get used to the CAT exam pattern, improve your time management skills, and reduce exam anxiety.

4. Focus on building concepts: Start with basic concepts and gradually progress to more advanced topics. Use standard books and reliable online resources to enhance your conceptual knowledge. 

5. Practice is the key: Spend a considerable amount of time solving problems from a wide range of difficulty levels. Practice with sectional quizzes, online timed tests, and topic-wise exercises.

6. Strengthen your vocabulary and reading skills: Read newspapers, magazines, and books to improve your vocabulary and comprehension skills. This will significantly help in the VARC section.

7. Join study groups and forums: Interacting with peers and experienced individuals can help you build your knowledge, exchange ideas, and stay motivated.

8. Keep your preparation balanced- Be consistent with your preparations and don't emphasize one section over another. Focus on each section and divide your time accordingly.

Question 2: What should be the strategy for CAT 2017?

Now that we've addressed preparation, let's discuss the strategy for CAT 2017:

1. Time management: Develop a time management plan for each section. Allocate a specific duration for each section depending on your proficiency and comfort level.

2. Attempt easy and moderate questions first: During the exam, focus on solving easy and moderately difficult questions before attempting the more difficult ones. This will help boost your confidence and ensure you get as many correct answers as possible from your strong areas.

3. Read questions carefully: Skim through each question carefully and understand what is being asked. This will prevent any misinterpretation and subsequent loss of marks.

4. Develop shortcuts and tricks: During your preparation, develop and learn shortcuts and tricks for faster calculations and problem-solving.

5. Stay calm and composed: Exam anxiety can be detrimental to your performance. Try to remain calm, composed, and confident throughout the examination process.

6. Flexibility: Be open to adapting your strategy during the exam if required. For example, if you are struggling with a particular section, switch to another and come back later, if time permits.

7. Review and confirm your responses: Before submitting the test, make sure to review your responses and double-check your answers, especially if there are tricky questions.

Therefore, while both questions are related, question 1 specifically enquires about the process of preparing for CAT 2017, whereas question 2 aims to outline the approach to be taken while writing the actual exam.
