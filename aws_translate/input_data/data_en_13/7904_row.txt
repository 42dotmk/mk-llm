Question: Jamie and Oliver are planning to go on a vacation. A plane ticket costs $24 for each person and a hotel stay costs $12 for each person per day. How much money will they spend on the vacation if they stay for 3 days?
Answer: Jamie and Oliver will spend $24 x 2 = $48 for the plane ticket. They will spend $12 x 2 = $24 for staying in the hotel per day. So, the total amount they will spend on the hotel for a 3 - day stay is $24 x 3 = $72. Therefore, the total amount they will spend on their vacation is $72 + $48 = $120. The answer is 120.
[Question]Pat’s computer password is made up of several kinds of alphanumeric and symbol characters for security. He uses a string of eight random lowercase letters, a string half that length of alternating upper case letters and numbers, and one symbol on each end of the password. How many characters in all is Pat‘s computer password?
[Answer]The second string of characters is half as long as the first string, so it is 8 / 2 = 4 characters long. The password has one symbol on each end, so it has 1 * 2 = 2 symbol characters. In all, Pat’s computer password is 8 + 4 + 2 = 14 characters long. The answer is 14.
Q: Two athletes decided to compete to see who had the best jumping ability. They were each going to do the long jump, triple jump, and high jump to see who had the highest average jump. The first athlete jumped 26 feet in the long jump, 30 feet in the triple jump, and 7 feet in the high jump. The second athlete jumped 24 feet in the long jump, 34 feet in the triple jump, and 8 feet in the high jump. What was the average jump of the winner?
A: The first athlete jumped a total of 63 feet because 26 + 30 + 7 = 63. The second athlete jumped a total of 66 feet because 24 + 34 + 8 = 66. The first athlete jumped 21 feet on average because 63 / 3 = 21. The second athlete jumped 22 feet on average because 66 / 3 = 22. The average jump of the winner was 22 feet because 22 > 21. The answer is 22.
Question: Casey is pumping water out of her well. She can pump 3 gallons a minute. She has 4 rows of 15 corn plants each, and each plant needs half a gallon of water. She also has 10 pigs, which each need 4 gallons of water, and 20 ducks that each need a quarter of a gallon of water. How many minutes does Casey need to spend pumping water?
Answer: First find how many corn plants there are: 15 plants / row * 4 rows = 60 plants. Then find how many gallons of water of the corn needs: 60 plants * 1 / 2 gallon / plant = 30 gallons. Then find how many gallons of water the pigs need: 10 pigs * 4 gallons / pig = 40 gallons. Then find how many gallons of water the ducks need: 20 ducks * 1 / 4 gallon / duck = 5 gallons. Now add up all three quantities of water to find the total water needed: 5 gallons + 40 gallons + 30 gallons = 75 gallons. Now divide the total water needed by Casey's pumping rate to find how long she spends pumping: 75 gallons / 3 gallons / minute = 25 minutes. The answer is 25.
[Question]Sophie's aunt gave her $260 to spend on clothes at the mall. She bought 2 shirts that cost $18.50 each and a pair of trousers that cost $63. She then decides to purchase 4 more articles of clothing with her remaining budget. How much money would each item cost if she split the cost of each item evenly?
[Answer]Sophie spent $18.50 × 2 = $37 on the two shirts. She spent in total $37 + $63 = $100 on clothes so far. She has $260 - $100 = $160 left to spend on clothes. Sophie has $160 ÷ 4 = $40 left to spend on each additional item of clothing. The answer is 40.
