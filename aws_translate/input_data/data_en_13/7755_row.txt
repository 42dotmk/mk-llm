The two questions raised are not the same, but they share a common theme: the influence of political, social, and historical factors on the strategic decision-making of nations. To address each question in detail:

1. Why do some Americans wrongly think Russia would conquer Europe without the few thousand US soldiers stationed on the continent?

This perception can be attributed to a number of factors, including historical events, the media, and a general misunderstanding of contemporary military capabilities. 

Historically, Europe has been the battleground for major wars and conflicts, particularly during World War II, when the Soviet Union expanded its territory and influence in Eastern Europe. This created a sense of wariness among Western countries, leading to the establishment of NATO in 1949, with the objective of providing collective security against potential Soviet aggression. The United States has been a key player in NATO, and its military presence in Europe is seen as a deterrent to Russian ambitions.

The media has also played a role in shaping this perception, with a tendency to focus on Russia's aggressive actions, such as its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and support for separatist movements in eastern Ukraine. This reinforces the fear of a Russian invasion of Europe. Moreover, movies and books from popular culture have often depicted Russia as a nefarious adversary to the West, which can exacerbate anxiety about its intentions.

Furthermore, there may be a general misunderstanding of contemporary military capabilities and strategies. Conventional warfare is no longer the only method for securing power and influence. Today, nations rely more on soft power and covert operations, economic leverage, and cyber-warfare to achieve their objectives. It is not necessary for Russia to physically conquer Europe, as they can wield influence through these other means. The presence of American troops in Europe, while a significant deterrent, does not solely determine Russia's ability to achieve its goals.

2. Why did the US and USSR have tens of thousands of nuclear weapons when only a few hundred would've been enough to destroy the other country?

The reason for this lies in the principle of deterrence and the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD), which were dominant during the Cold War era.

Deterrence, in this context, means that by possessing a large number of nuclear weapons, each side could guarantee that it could retaliate and cause devastating consequences to the other side in the event of an attack. The potential devastation was intended to prevent either side from considering a preemptive nuclear strike, as it would essentially be suicidal. The balance of nuclear power acted as a stabilizing factor, despite the inherent risks involved.

MAD's rationale is the idea that if both sides possess enough nuclear firepower to completely annihilate the other, regardless of who initiates the conflict, it would eliminate any incentive for either side to start a nuclear war. With this mindset, possessing significantly more nuclear weapons than necessary to destroy the other country may seem like an advantage, as it might convince the opponent that retaliation would be even more catastrophic.

In summary, both questions raise distinct issues regarding strategic decisions made by the US and Russia (or the USSR), but they are not the same. One focuses on the perception of Russian aggression and the importance of US military presence in Europe, while the other delves into the rationale behind the possession of large nuclear arsenals during the Cold War. Yet, both questions highlight the significant impact of historical, social, and political factors on national security decision-making.
