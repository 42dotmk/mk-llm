[Question]James buys 3 dirt bikes for $150 each and 4 off-road vehicles for $300 each. It also cost him $25 to register each of these. How much did he pay for everything?
[Answer]The dirtbikes cost 3 * 150 = $450. The off - road vehicles cost 300 * 4 = $1200. He had to register 3 + 4 = 7 vehicles. That means registration cost 25 * 7 = $175. So the total cost of everything was 450 + 1200 + 175 = $1825. The answer is 1825.
Q: 3 families of 4 people shared a vacation rental for 7 days. Everyone uses 1 oversized beach towel a day before getting a new one. The washing machine can hold 14 oversized beach towels per load. How many loads of laundry will it take to wash all the oversized beach towels?
A: There are 3 families of 4 meaning there are 3 * 4 = 12 people in the vacation rental. They all use 1 oversized beach towel a day so they use 1 * 12 = 12 towels a day. They use 12 towels a day for 7 days so in one week they use 12 * 7 = 84 beach towels. The washing machine can only hold 14 towels and they have 84 towels to wash which means there are 84 / 14 = 6 loads of laundry. The answer is 6.
Question: Yolanda leaves home for work at 7:00 AM, riding her bike at 20 miles per hour. 15 minutes after she leaves, her husband realizes that she forgot her lunch, and jumps in the car to bring it to her. If he drives at 40 miles per hour and follows the exact same route as Yolanda, how many minutes will it take him to catch her?
Answer: Let x be the number of minutes it takes Yolanda's husband to catch her. We know that Yolanda will spend a total of x + 15 minutes riding her bike since she left 15 minutes before her husband. The distance each person travels is equal to their travel speed times the number of minutes they spend traveling. That means Yolanda's distance is equal to 20 mph * (x + 15) and her husband's distance is equal to 40 mph * x. Yolanda's husband catches up to her when they've both traveled the same distance, which is when 20(x + 15) = 40x. We can simplify this equation by multiplying 20 through the parentheses to get 20x + 300 = 40x. Then we can subtract 20x from each side to get 300 = 20x. Finally, we divide both sides by 20 to find that x = 15. The answer is 15.
[Question]A washing machine uses 20 gallons of water for a heavy wash, 10 gallons of water for a regular wash, and 2 gallons of water for a light wash per load of laundry. If bleach is used, there is an extra light wash cycle added to rinse the laundry thoroughly. There are two heavy washes, three regular washes, and one light wash to do. Two of the loads need to be bleached. How many gallons of water will be needed?
[Answer]The two heavy washes will use 20 * 2 = 40 gallons of water. The three regular washes will use 10 * 3 = 30 gallons of water. The light wash will use 2 * 1 = 2 gallons of water. The two bleached loads will use an extra 2 * 2 = 4 gallons of water. In all, 40 + 30 + 2 + 4 = 76 gallons of water will be needed. The answer is 76.
Q: There are 18 green leaves on each of the 3 tea leaf plants. One-third of them turn yellow and fall off on each of the tea leaf plants. How many green leaves are left on the tea leaf plants?
A: In total, the 3 tea leaf plants have 18 x 3 = 54 green leaves. One - third of the yellow leaves falling off of all plants is 54 / 3 = 18. The number of remaining green leaves on the plants is 54 - 18 = 36. The answer is 36.
