Favreau full of gratitude

By Scott Bowles, USA TODAY

SAN DIEGO  The prodigal son has returned.

Jon Favreau, who showed footage from Iron Man here two years ago and became an immediate Comic-Con icon, is back.

His new movie, Cowboys & Aliens, has barely begun production, so he doesn't have much to bring here.

But he does have gratitude.

"I wanted to come back and say thanks to the fans," says Favreau, director of both Iron Man movies and the sci-fi fantasy Zathura. "You don't want to be forgotten by these guys."

That's not likely to happen anytime soon, at least at Comic-Con. Favreau's introduction of Iron Man in 2008 has become the gold standard for convention panels.

"I still think about that day," Favreau says of the panel discussion, in which he unspooled the first footage of his movie to Black Sabbath's Iron Man. By the time Favreau walked off the stage, Comic-Con was on its feet, bloggers were on his side and his two Iron Man films would gross more than $1.1 billion worldwide.

"That (panel) changed everything," Favreau says. "I think it's important to let them know what they did for me."

And to let them know what he's got coming up. Favreau's next film is a story about Western settlers and Apache warriors who band together in the late 1800s to battle marauding aliens.

Far-fetched? Sure. But so is a story about a playboy who flies around in a metal suit. The secret to making the unusual seem ordinary, Favreau says, is to take your milieu seriously.

"The Western was a very compelling genre until the 1970s," he says. "It deals with loss, fear, the unknown."

But over time, he says, it lost touch with audiences, who were turning to the more street-savvy stories of Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and John Cassavetes. "The Vietnam War changed the paradigm," Favreau says. "When (Westerns) were no longer the go-to genre for profitability, it faded."

So he's got his own heavyweight to resuscitate the genre: producer Steven Spielberg. Spielberg held a private screening for Favreau and his cast — which includes Harrison Ford, Daniel Craig and Olivia Wilde —- of a restored version of John Wayne's classic Western The Searchers.

"He gave us a running commentary, really broke it down," Favreau says. "And he's the guy that essentially invented the alien movie. So he knew" both genres.

The screening inspired the 43-year-old director, who decided not to update either genre, or create a fantastic twist that ties the genres together.

"We weren't going to do a Jonah Hex or a Wild, Wild, West ," Favreau says of those much maligned movies. "We're going to play both sides straight."

On the alien side, "we wanted that to have that feel of other sci-fi movies before the CGI boom, like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Alien, Predators We want to be true to both genres and apologize for neither."

He may not have to apologize, but Favreau knows he still has to impress. Comic-Con fans, he says, are the quickest to turn on a director who doesn't have the goods.

"They don't care about back story, they don't care about the politics it took to get your movie made," he says. "They only care about what they see on the screen."

And what will they see on the screen? As usual, Favreau is saving his secrets for Comic-Con.

But he does add: "Westerns and alien movies are a better combination than I thought they'd. The themes do intersect. And it's pretty wild to see a gunfighter, on horseback, running from an alien ship. I'm excited to be back."
