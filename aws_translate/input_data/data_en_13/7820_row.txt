Q: Nancy is filling an aquarium for her fish. She fills it halfway and goes to answer the door. While she's gone, her cat knocks the aquarium over and spills half the water in it. Then Nancy comes back and triples the amount of water in the aquarium. If the aquarium is 4 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 3 feet high, how many cubic feet of water are in the aquarium?
A: First calculate the volume of the aquarium by multiplying its length, width and height: 4 ft * 6 ft * 3 ft = 72 cubic ft. Then figure out what proportion of the aquarium is full after the cat knocks it over: 1 / 2 * 1 / 2 = 1 / 4. Then figure out what proportion of the aquarium is full after Nancy refills it: 3 * 1 / 4 = 3 / 4. Now multiply the proportion of the aquarium that's full by the aquarium's volume to find out how much water is in it: 72 cubic ft * 3 / 4 = 54 cubic ft. The answer is 54.

[Question]John works a job that offers performance bonuses. He makes $80 a day and works for 8 hours. He has the option of working hard to earn the performance bonus of an extra $20 a day, but the extra effort results in a 2-hour longer workday. How much does John make per hour if he decides to earn the bonus?
[Answer]First, we need to determine the length of John's workday if he decides to earn the bonus. We do this by performing 8 + 2 = 10 hours for his workday. Next, we need to determine his overall pay. We do this by performing 80 + 20 = 100 dollars a day. We then determine John's hourly rate by dividing his pay by the number of hours worked, performing 100 / 10 = 10 dollars an hour. The answer is 10.
Q: A shady restaurant is charging customers gratuities after taxes without them being aware. If my total bill was $140, the sales tax in my city is 10%, I ordered a NY Striploin for $80, and I ordered a glass of wine for $10, how much did they charge me for gratuities?
A: The total bill before taxes or gratuities was $80 for the steak + $10 for the wine = $80 + $10 = $90. If the tax is 10%, then the taxes paid were $90 * 10% = $9. That means that the total bill before gratuities was $90 + $9 = $99. If the final bill was $140, then you were charged $140 - $99 = $41 for gratuities. The answer is 41.
Question: Cadence has worked for her new company five months longer than she worked for her old company. If she worked at her old company for 3 years earning $5000 per month, and she's now earning 20% more in the new company, calculate the total amount of money she's earned in both companies in the period she's worked for them?
Answer: In her old company, if she worked for three years, the total number of months she was paid for is 3 years * 12, which is the number of months in a year = 36 months. If each month she was paid $5000, her total earnings in the old company were $5000 * 36 = $180000. In her new company, she is paid 20% more, which is 20 / 100 * $5000 = $1000 per month more than what she was paid at the old company. In total, she earns $5000 + $1000 = $6000 per month in her new company. Since she's worked five months more in the new company than the old company, she has worked for 36 + 5 = 41 months in the new company. The total amount she's earned in the new company is $6000 * 41 = $246000. The combined total for both companies is $246000 + $180000 = $426000. The answer is 426000.
