Tiger Woods apologizes for affairs; return to golf unknown
Almost as soon as Woods left the podium in Florida on Friday, some of the corporate sponsors who've stood by him started firing off prepared statements of support.

Nike spokeswoman Beth Gast said in a statement: "Tiger has apologized and made his position clear. Nike fully supports him and his family. We look forward to him returning to golf."

Peter Moore, president of EA Sports, said the company's relationship with Woods remains unchanged: "It was good to see Tiger address the public today, and we're supportive of his focus toward family and rebuilding his life. He remains one of the greatest athletes in history, and as a long-standing partner, we look forward to seeing Tiger back on the golf course when the time is right for him and his family."

Terry Melia of Upper Deck said the company "continues to stand by Tiger Woods and wishes him all the best on his road to recovery. Our exclusive autographed memorabilia contract with Tiger remains intact."

Gillette, which has downplayed use of Woods in its ads, also expressed support. "Tiger spoke today and addressed the issues he felt were most important. His words stand on their own. We wish him and his family the best," spokesman Michael Norton said in a statement.

Not a single one of his remaining sponsors has aired a prime-time TV commercial starring Woods since Nov. 29, according to Aaron Lewis of Nielsen. That was two days after the crash that triggered the media frenzy over his extramarital affairs.

MARANA, Ariz.  Breaking nearly three months of silence,

, his voice cracking and his eyes moistening at times, apologized Friday for having affairs and said he plans to return to the PGA Tour.

When that will be, however, is unknown.

Speaking for a bit more than 13 minutes from the clubhouse at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., near the PGA Tour's headquarters, Woods addressed about 40 people who were in the room, including his mother.

His wife, Elin, was not obviously present.

"Every one of you (in this room) has good reason to be critical of me," said Woods, who was wearing a black suit and blue dress shirt. "I want to say to each of you, simply and directly, I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behavior I engaged in.

"As Elin pointed out to me, my real apology to her will not come in the form of words, it will come from my behavior over time," Woods said. "We have a lot to discuss. However, what we say to each other will remain between the two of us."

Repeatedly throughout his statement Woods took responsibility for being unfaithful and said he and his wife "have started the process of discussing the damage caused by my behavior."

Using words such as foolish, selfish, embarrassed and unfaithful, Woods said he would be returning Saturday to an unnamed center for "more treatment and more therapy."

Woods, who is on an indefinite leave from the Tour, did not indicate when he might return to playing golf.

"I plan to return to golf one day. I just don't know when that day will be," he said. "I don't rule out that it will be this year. When I do return I need to make my behavior more respectfully of the game."

The world's No. 1 golfer had not talked in public since his traffic accident on Nov. 27 triggered shocking revelations about his serial infidelity. His appearance Friday was tightly controlled. Only three reporters from wire services were allowed in the room where Woods faced a single camera. More than 200 credentialed media watched a live TV feed in the Sawgrass Marriott banquet room more than a mile away.

Woods did not take any questions

After his statement, Woods hugged his mother and she whispered in his ear.

"I said 'I'm so proud of you. Never think you stand alone. Mom will always be there for you and I love you,' " Kultida Woods told The Associated Press.

"I'm so proud to be his mother. Period. This thing, it teaches him, just like golf," his mom said. "When he changes a swing, he wants to get better. He will start getting better. It's just like that. Golf is just like life, when you make a mistake, you learn from your mistake and move on stronger. That's the way he is. As a human being everyone has faults, makes mistakes and sins. We all do. But, we move on when we make a mistake and learn from it. I am upset the way the media treated him like he's a criminal. He didn't kill anybody, he didn't do anything illegal. They've being carrying on from Thanksgiving until now. That's not right."

Admitting he felt he "deserved to enjoy the temptations" that came with his fabulous success, Woods said he was solely responsible for his actions.

"I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behavior," Woods said.

Woods, his voice rising, also defended his wife.

"I have a lot to atone for, but there is one issue I really want to discuss. Some people have speculated that Elin somehow hurt or attacked me on Thanksgiving night," Woods said. "It angers me that people would fabricate a story like that. Elin never hit me that night or any other night. There has never been an episode of domestic violence in our marriage. Ever.

"Elin has shown enormous grace and poise throughout this ordeal. Elin deserves praise, not blame. The issue involved here was my repeated irresponsible behavior. I was unfaithful. I had affairs. I cheated. What I did is not acceptable, and I am the only person to blame."

Woods also made a plea to the news media.

"I have always tried to maintain a private space for my wife and children. They have been kept separate from my sponsors, my commercial endorsements. When my children were born, we only released photographs so that the paparazzi could not chase them," Woods said. "However, my behavior doesn't make it right for the media to follow my 2 1/2-year-old daughter to school and report the school's location. They staked out my wife and they pursued my mom. Whatever my wrongdoings, for the sake of my family, please leave my wife and kids alone."

Woods said he was in treatment for 45 days and will return for more therapy, adding he has more work to do to resolve his personal problems.

"I stopped living by the core values that I was taught to believe in," Woods said. "I knew my actions were wrong, but I convinced myself that normal rules didn't apply. I never thought about who I was hurting. Instead, I thought only about myself. I ran straight through the boundaries that a married couple should live by. I thought I could get away with whatever I wanted to. I felt that I had worked hard my entire life and deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me. I felt I was entitled. Thanks to money and fame, I didn't have to go far to find them.

"I was wrong. I was foolish. I don't get to play by different rules. The same boundaries that apply to everyone apply to me. I brought this shame on myself. I hurt my wife, my kids, my mother, my wife's family, my friends, my foundation, and kids all around the world who admired me."

As for his marriage, he said: "Every one of these questions and answers is a matter between Elin and me, issues between a husband and wife."

More than 1,750 miles away in Marana, Ariz., players still alive in the World Golf Championships-Accenture Match Play Championship welcomed Woods' message.

"I think it was a sincere apology," Luke Donald said at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in the hills north of Tucson. "He made it clear he wanted the media to leave his family alone, which I agree with. It sounds like he's getting the help he needs. Hopefully he'll be back on the golf course soon."

Stewart Cink, who lost to Woods in the Match Play Championship final in 2008, said Woods' speech was "heartfelt."

"It sounds like it's part of the recovery or the healing process that he has to go through," Cink said. "I've got a couple of good friends at home that have gone through the alcohol abuse program with AA, and similar steps are taken in the healing process where you have to make amends to the people you've hurt, and you have to start the bridge to the other side.

"It sounded like it was a difficult thing for him to do. Tiger's a tough guy, and like he said, he'll overcome this."

Ben Crane, who won the Farmers Insurance Open earlier this year at Torrey Pines in San Diego, where Woods won six Buick Invitationals and the 2008 U.S. Open, referred to one of his favorite stories in the Bible for his reaction to Woods' statement.

"One of the first things that came to my mind is one of my favorite stories in the Bible which talks about a woman who has sinned and she's been a prostitute and everyone brings her before Jesus," Crane said. "And they say shouldn't we stone her? Shouldn't we kill her for all these bad things that she's done? And Jesus says, yes, absolutely, stone her. But you without sin be the one to cast the first stone.

"And you know what, I thought it was an amazing conference. I thought Tiger was very humble. And, you know what, I think we all love him as a golfer and as a family man. And we want to see what's best for him, and I think everything he did is going to help him get back soon and help him."

Notah Begay, a PGA Tour golfer and a friend of Woods' since the two met at Stanford University, was in the front row at the appearance.

"I was emotional and got a little choked up," Begay said. "The sincerity of his remarks and the thoughtfulness in his message was very apparent. It's tough to get any man in America just to go?to marriage counseling, let alone go into a 45-day rehabilitation. Plus he's going back (Saturday), and that tells me that he's trying to learn about the issues.

"He's trying to learn about the thought processes that caused the actions, so that he can cut them off next time."

Butch Harmon, who coached Woods for 10 years, was at the Match Play watching his pupil, Nick Watney, play in the third round. Harmon said he had never seen Woods look so "humbled" in his life.

"It was good to see him, that he is all right," Harmon said. "Obviously, he appeared very humble. I think he has a long way to go before he plays again. Any type of rehab you go into is a long process and takes time, and he's just starting the process. I'm not sure he will play golf this year.

"It was good to hear him say he wants to play golf again. I respect his right to privacy but I think he will have to answer some questions eventually. Bottom line, I don't think he has ever looked that humbled before. He is incredibly embarrassed, as he should be. He brought it on himself.

"It was a very hard thing for him to do, which you could see in his speech and in his demeanor. It will be a long road back for him."

PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem was in the room for Woods' appearance. Finchem believes Woods has taken a giant step forward in his road to healing and recovery.

"I think if there's anything about Tiger Woods that's been evident over the last 14 years is that when he sets his mind to do something and he brings the attention and focus that he can to do something, he's been successful," Finchem said. "And certainly that includes improvement in almost every area, whether it's his game, his business acumen, his presentation, his ability to talk on his feet. And he laid out this morning, I think, what he feels like he needs to deal with.

"And from my personal perspective of watching him over the years, I give him an excellent chance to manage to do exactly that. I'll just take him for the roadmap that he laid out this morning and look forward to seeing how that progresses. … At the end of the day, he's a human being. We all make mistakes. We all have made mistakes. And when we're lucky, we learn from those mistakes and we get to be better people. And it seems to me that's the course that he is on."
