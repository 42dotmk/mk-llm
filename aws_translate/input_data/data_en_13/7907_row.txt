[Question]A quantity surveyor is figuring the construction costs for a couple that wishes to build a house. The costs are as follows: land costs $50 per square meter, bricks cost $100 per 1000 bricks and roof tiles cost $10 per roof tile. If the house they wish to build requires 2000 square meters, 10000 bricks, and 500 roof tiles, how much construction costs are required for this project?
[Answer]The cost required for buying land is $50 / sq m * 2000 sq m = $100000. The cost required for buying bricks is $100 / 1000 bricks * 10000 bricks = $1000. The cost required for buying roof tiles is $10 / tile * 500 tiles = $5000. The total construction cost is $100000 + $1000 + $5000 = $106000. The answer is 106000.
Q: Joey needs to take a new prescription. The first day he needs to take one pill. Each day he must take two more pills than the previous day. How many pills will he take in a week?
A: For the second day he takes 1 + 2 = 3 pills. For the third day he takes 3 + 2 = 5 pills. For the fourth day he takes 5 + 2 = 7 pills. For the fifth day he takes 7 + 2 = 9 pills. For the sixth day he takes 9 + 2 = 11 pills. For the seventh day he takes 11 + 2 = 13 pills. For the entire week he takes a total of 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 = 49 pills. The answer is 49.
Question: Ryan is looking for people to crowdfund his new business idea. If the average person funds $10 to a project they're interested in, how many people will Ryan have to recruit to fund a $1,000 business if he has $200 already?
Answer: First, we need to determine how much money Ryan needs to hit his goal which we find by subtracting his available cash from his target, performing 1000 - 200 = 800 dollars needed. Since the average person contributes $10 when crowdfunding, this means he needs to find 800 / 10 = 80 people to fund his business well enough for him to hit his goal. The answer is 80.
[Question]Carmen is preparing dinner plates for a row of customers at the counter in a diner. She likes to put a couple of sprigs of parsley on each plate for decoration. However, she is very low on parsley and doesn't have enough to even put 1 sprig on every plate, so she needs to break several of the parsley sprigs in two to make 2 smaller ones to stretch them out. If she decorates 8 plates with one whole parsley sprig and 12 plates with 1/2 a sprig each, how many sprigs of parsley does she have left if she started with 25?
[Answer]Carmen decorates 8 plates with 1 whole sprig of parsley, 8 plates x 1 parsley sprig each = 8 parsley sprigs. She also decorates 12 plates with 1 / 2 a sprig each, 12 x 1 / 2 = 6 parsley sprigs. She started with 25 parsley sprigs and has used 8 + 6 = 14 parsley sprigs. After using 14 parsley sprigs, she has 25 - 14 = 11 sprigs left. The answer is 11.
Q: Owen bought 12 boxes of face masks that cost $9 per box. Each box has 50 pieces of masks. He repacked 6 of these boxes and sold them for $5 per 25 pieces. He sold the remaining 300 face masks in baggies at the rate of 10 pieces of mask for $3. How much profit did he make?
A: Owen bought 12 boxes for a total of $9 / box x 12 boxes = $108. Six boxes contains 6 boxes x 50 masks / box = 300 face masks. Owen made 300 masks / 25 masks / repack = 12 repacks. So, his revenue for selling those repacked face masks is $5 x 12 repacks = $60. There are 300 masks / 10 masks / baggy = 30 baggies face masks. So, his revenue for that is $3 / baggy x 30 baggies = $90. Hence, his total revenue for all the face masks is $60 + $90 = $150. This gives him a profit of $150 - $108 = $42. The answer is 42.
