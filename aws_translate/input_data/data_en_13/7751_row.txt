Title: Reza Khan's Promotion and the Russian Seizure of Tehran: A Glimpse into Iran's Turbulent Past

Introduction

In the early twentieth century, Iran found itself in a state of political and social upheaval, with foreign powers vying for control over its vast oil resources and strategically crucial position. Two significant events that transpired during this period were the rise and promotion of Reza Khan and the seizure of Tehran by Russian forces. This article intends to provide an in-depth exploration of these two incidents and determine their chronological order while shedding light on their historical context and significance.

The Rise of Reza Khan

Reza Khan was a military officer of Cossack origin, serving in Iran's Persian Cossack Brigade, a unit that was trained and officered by Russians. Born in 1878 in the Alasht village, Mazandaran Province, Reza Khan rose through the military ranks rapidly, mainly due to his abilities and ambition. His military prowess was undeniable, and he was widely renowned as a skilled and disciplined soldier, which allowed him to win favor within the Iranian elite circle.

In February 1921, Reza Khan, collaborating with journalist-turned-politician Sayyid Zia'eddin Tabatabaee, orchestrated a coup d'état. Amid the disarray resulting from the country's weak central government and domestic turmoil, Reza Khan led the Persian Cossack Brigade into Tehran. He successfully gained control of the capital, forcing the government to resign. After the coup, Sayyid Zia became the prime minister, while Reza Khan was appointed commander-in-chief of Iranian military forces.

Over the next few years, Reza Khan consolidated his power, subdued regional revolts, and unified the country. Ultimately, he established the Pahlavi dynasty in 1925, declared himself Reza Shah Pahlavi, and ruled Iran until his forced abdication in 1941, under pressure from the British and Soviet forces.

The Russian Seizure of Tehran

Iran's weakness and vulnerability towards foreign intervention at the turn of the twentieth century, combined with the geopolitical rivalries between Britain and Russia, led to the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907. This agreement effectively divided Iran into spheres of influence. Russia took control of the northern part of Iran, while Britain gained control over the southern regions.

During World War I, Iran had proclaimed neutrality. However, due to its strategic geographical location, it became a battleground for the Entente and Central Powers. In 1915, Russian forces seized Tehran, primarily to secure their influence within the country, maintain control over its northern regions, and counter potential threats from the Ottoman Empire and Central Powers. The Russian occupation of Tehran continued until 1917 when the Bolshevik Revolution engulfed Russia, leading the Russians to withdraw their troops from Iran.

Chronological Order

Based on the historical context, it becomes clear that the seizure of Tehran by Russian forces occurred before Reza Khan's rise in Iran's military and political hierarchy. The Russian takeover of Tehran took place in 1915 during World War I, while Reza Khan's coup d'état and subsequent promotion occurred in 1921, marking the beginning of a new era in Iranian history.

Conclusion

The early twentieth century Iran was a theater of geopolitical rivalries, foreign intervention, and domestic turmoil. The Russian seizure of Tehran in 1915, followed by Reza Khan's rise to power and promotion in 1921, were significant events that shaped the subsequent trajectory of the country. Understanding the chronology and context of these incidents helps shed light on Iran's tumultuous past and provides a deeper insight into the nation's historical narrative.
