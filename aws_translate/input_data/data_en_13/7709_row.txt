Oliver Leaman is a well-known scholar and philosopher who is particularly interested in the study of Islamic, Jewish, and Oriental philosophies. Among his areas of interest is the philosophy dominant in Sri Lanka, which is predominantly influenced by Theravada Buddhism and elements of traditional Sri Lankan culture.

Theravada Buddhism, also known as "The Doctrine of the Elders," is an ancient school of Buddhism and the dominant form of the belief system in countries like Sri Lanka, Burma (Myanmar), Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. This school of thought stands out due to its emphasis on the Pali Canon, a comprehensive collection of sacred texts that serve as the primary source of knowledge for Theravada Buddhism.

One of the key philosophical points in Theravada Buddhism is the understanding and realization of the Four Noble Truths. The first truth, "dukkha," refers to the existence of suffering or unsatisfactoriness in life. The second, "samudaya," is the acknowledgment of the causes of suffering, which are essentially rooted in desire, craving, and ignorance. The third truth, "nirodha," recognizes that suffering can be brought to an end through the cessation of these causes, and the fourth truth, "magga," presents the Eightfold Path as the way to achieve the cessation of suffering (enlightenment or Nirvana).

The Eightfold Path consists of a set of ethical, mental, and contemplative practices meant to guide individuals toward understanding reality and attaining enlightenment. These practices are organized into three main areas: morality (sila), concentration (samadhi), and wisdom (pañña). Followers are encouraged to cultivate these virtues to overcome cravings, desire, and aversion, which are associated with dukkha.

Sri Lankan philosophy also places a strong emphasis on the importance of meditation and mindfulness practices. There are various styles of meditation prominent in the tradition, including Vipassana (insight) meditation, Samatha (concentration) meditation, and Metta (loving-kindness) meditation. The goal of these practices is to develop both clarity of thought and the direct experience of ultimate truths.

In addition to meditation practices and the focus on the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, Theravada Buddhism also teaches the doctrine of ‘anicca,' or impermanence. This concept refers to the transient nature of existence, as every aspect of life is subject to change, decay, and cessation. By understanding impermanence, practitioners can develop the ability to let go of attachments and aversions that obstruct the path to enlightenment.

Sri Lanka also has a rich philosophical tradition linked to its history, political and socio-cultural evolution. The development of a unique Sri Lankan identity was greatly influenced by interactions with Indian, Southeast Asian, and European philosophies and religions over the centuries. As a result, Sri Lankan philosophical thought is characterized by a blend of indigenous wisdom, Theravada Buddhist principles, and a diverse assortment of external cultural and philosophical influences.

In summary, Oliver Leaman's interest in the philosophy dominant in Sri Lanka is centered on Theravada Buddhism and the unique cultural amalgamation that has shaped Sri Lankan thought. Key philosophical concepts such as the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, meditation and mindfulness practices, and the doctrines of impermanence and non-attachment are integral to this rich and diverse school of thought. Studying Sri Lankan philosophy enables us to gain a deeper understanding of the historical and cultural factors that have contributed to the development of its unique perspective on the nature of reality, ethics, and the path to enlightenment.
