Title: The Secret Identity of Lord Pengallan

Genre: Adventure, Mystery, Drama

In the coastal town of Tresswich, England during the mid-19th century, our story unfolds around a series of mysterious events, the heart of which is an enigmatic man by the name of Lord Pengallan (played by Benedict Cumberbatch), a wealthy and influential resident of the town. Despite being well-known and respected in the community, there is a cloud of mystique surrounding Pengallan, as very few people truly know about his past or much about his personal life.

The protagonist of our story is the charming and determined detective, Richard Traherne (played by Tom Hardy), who hails from London and arrives in Tresswich on the request of a young woman named Emily (played by Emma Watson). Emily, who has recently inherited the local inn from her recently deceased father, has become increasingly concerned about the suspicious activities she has observed around the town. She believes that there may be a secret society of smugglers with sinister intentions operating within the community and fears for her life after a series of veiled threats.

Thrilled by the prospect of solving such an enigmatic case, Traherne immediately commences his investigations, blending in with the locals and seeking information. As he unravels the town's numerous secrets, Traherne encounters several intriguing characters with mysterious intentions, all somehow connected to Lord Pengallan. This includes a self-proclaimed priest, who is questioned by the townspeople due to a lack of verifiable references (played by Daniel Radcliffe), and a cunning merchant by the name of Marcus (played by Idris Elba) who seems to have an uncanny knowledge of the town's secret activities.

As Traherne grows closer to uncovering the truth behind the rumors of smuggling and conspiracy, he faces numerous obstacles and near-death experiences. It is in the climax of the movie that Traherne uncovers that Lord Pengallan himself is the mastermind behind the secret smuggling operations. Lord Pengallan, who has been watching Traherne's investigation closely throughout the story, eventually decides to reveal himself and his intentions to Traherne in a final confrontation.

In a dramatic and intense scene, Pengallan tells Traherne that these illegal activities were designed to actually benefit the town by providing valuable resources and support, unbeknownst to the townspeople. He explains that his family has followed this tradition for generations, using their wealth to help those in need. However, with the death of Emily's father – who was once Pengallan's loyal ally in these operations – smuggling activities were exposed, though Pengallan's involvement remained a secret.

Traherne, faced with this surprising revelation, must decide whether to enforce the law and arrest Pengallan or to empathize with his motives and help him to operate in a more discreet and legal way. Ultimately, Traherne agrees to aid Pengallan in devising a new plan to support the town without resorting to illegal activities. With Traherne's guidance, Pengallan transforms his smuggling ring into a legitimate enterprise, establishing a trade company that provides employment and much-needed resources for the town.

The movie ends with Pengallan expressing his gratitude to Traherne, but the bond formed during their collaboration is cut short as Traherne must return to London. However, he leaves with a renewed sense of purpose and accomplishment, knowing he has brought change and justice to the town of Tresswich. Lord Pengallan's actions have not gone unnoticed, and the town remains eternally grateful to their enigmatic benefactor, whose motives were finally revealed to only one man – Richard Traherne.
