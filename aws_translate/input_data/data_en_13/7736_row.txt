[Question]Pat’s computer password is made up of several kinds of alphanumeric and symbol characters for security. He uses a string of eight random lowercase letters, a string half that length of alternating upper case letters and numbers, and one symbol on each end of the password. How many characters in all is Pat‘s computer password?
[Answer]The second string of characters is half as long as the first string, so it is 8 / 2 = 4 characters long. The password has one symbol on each end, so it has 1 * 2 = 2 symbol characters. In all, Pat’s computer password is 8 + 4 + 2 = 14 characters long. The answer is 14.
Q: Jimmy is at the candy store and buys 2 candy bars for $.75 each. He then buys 4 lollipops that cost $.25 each. He spent 1/6 of the money he earned from shoveling snow. If he charges $1.5 per driveway, how many driveways did he shovel?
A: Jimmy spent $1.5 on candy bars because 2 x .75 = 1.5. He spent $1 on lollipops because 4 x .25 = 1. He spent $2.5 in total because 1.5 + 1 = 2.5. He earned $15 shoveling driveways because 2.5 / (1 / 6) = 15. He shoveled 10 driveways because 15 / 1.5 = 10. The answer is 10.
Question: A couple agreed to split their expenses equally, including the salary of their house help. While doing her job, the house help had an accident; thus, she underwent a medical procedure which cost her $128. The couple decided to pay half of the medical expenses and the other half will be deducted from her $160 salary. If the husband paid for the entire half of the hospital bill, how much does he still need to pay so that they split the expenses for the house help equally?
Answer: The amount that the couple would cover for the hospital bill is $128 / 2 = $64. The couple's total expenses (salary and hospital bill) is $160 + $64 = $224. So each of them should give $224 / 2 = $112 in total. Since the husband paid the entire half of the hospital bill already ($64), he still needs to pay $112 - $64 = $48. The answer is 48.
[Question]Carl has been selling watermelons on the side of the road for $3 each. This evening he went home with $105 in profit and 18 watermelons. How many watermelons did he start out with this morning?
[Answer]Carl sells his watermelons for $3 each so today he sold $105 / $3 per watermelon = 35 watermelons. He had 18 watermelons left over, so this morning he started with 18 + 35 = 53 watermelons. The answer is 53.
Q: Ronnie is a train engineer. His train pulls 3 red boxcars, 4 blue boxcars, and 7 black boxcars. If the black boxcars can each hold 4000 pounds of coal, which is half as much as what the blue boxcars can hold, and the red boxcars can hold 3 times as much as the blue boxcars, how many pounds of coal can all of the train's boxcars combined hold?
A: If we let X represent the number of pounds of coal that the blue boxcar can hold, then 4000 = (1 / 2)X. Solving for X, we get X = 8000 pounds of coal, which represents what the blue car can hold. Thus, the red boxcar can hold 3 * 8000 = 24,000 pounds of coal. 3 red boxcars can carry 3 * 24,000 = 72,000 pounds of coal. 7 black boxcars can carry 7 * 4,000 = 28,000 pounds of coal. 4 blue boxcars carry 4 * 8,000 = 32,000 pounds of coal. Together, all the trains boxcars can carry 72,000 + 28,000 + 32,000 = 132,000 pounds of coal. The answer is 132000.
