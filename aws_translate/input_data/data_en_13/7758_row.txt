Genre: Action, Adventure, Drama

Plot Summary:
In a time when kingdoms and empires clash with sword and sorcery, Connan, the last survivor of his bloodline, sets forth on a quest to avenge the brutal massacre of his people by the vicious warlord, Thulsa Do'rak. Along the way, Connan befriends an enigmatic thief, Subotai, and the two of them embark on a dangerous journey through war-torn lands and mythical realms filled with unimaginable creatures, ferocious battles, and legends of old.

Act 1:
In the aftermath of the violent raid that leaves his village in ruins and his entire clan slaughtered, Connan barely escapes with his life. Now an orphan, he is taken in by a hermit who teaches him about herbs, healing arts, and other practical skills. Among the ravines and hills, Connan grows up to be strong and resourceful with intense hatred for Do'rak and a burning desire to take revenge.

Years later, a chance encounter with a group of thieves leads Connan to Subotai, a skilled archer and thief with a sharp wit and unmatched agility. Initially cautious of each other, the two eventually gain each other's trust and form an unbreakable bond of friendship. Subotai shares his knowledge of the world, and together they hone their skills in combat and survival, all the while plotting their revenge on Do'rak and his ruthless empire.

Act 2:
As Connan and Subotai travel across the lands, they encounter various groups of people, some helpful, some hostile. Among them, a blind oracle predicts a great fate awaiting the duo, and a warrior princess named Valeria who aids them in their journey; she is captivated by Connan's iron will and unwavering sense of justice.

The trio encounters a number of ordeals that test their limits, including battling supernatural beasts, traversing perilous landscapes, and facing off against a band of mercenaries sent by Do'rak upon learning about Connan's intentions. Connan and Subotai, along with Valeria, display great teamwork, loyalty, and the essence of true friendship, standing by each other through thick and thin.

Act 3:
As the trio uncover the whereabouts of Do'rak's stronghold—a fortress hidden within the nearly impenetrable, treacherous Labyrinth of Shadows, they discover that to reach and defeat their nemesis, they must liberate four relics known as the "Pillars of Eternity" scattered across the land. These relics hold the power to dissolve the ancient ward guarding the entrance of the Labyrinth.

Connan, Subotai, and Valeria confront a series of challenges as they each face a task to retrieve a relic of their own. Their friendship and individual strengths are put to the test, but their unwavering determination to avenge the innocents slaughtered by Do'rak and to end his reign of terror bind them together in an unbreakable bond.

The climax of the movie unfolds as our heroes assemble the Pillars of Eternity and unlock the hidden door to the Labyrinth of Shadows. They battle their way through the fortress filled with monstrous guards and lethal traps. Finally, they confront the warlord, Thulsa Do'rak, and after an epic battle filled with blood, sweat, and tears, ultimately emerge victorious.

Epilogue:
In the end, Connan, Subotai, and Valeria dismantle Do'rak's empire, liberating the people who once lived under his rule. Our protagonists deviate from their separate paths, enriched by the bonds forged on their remarkable journey and each embarking on their own path of adventure.

The movie ends with a narration that these tales of the unbreakable bond between Connan and Subotai will echo through the annals of time—stories of friendship, loyalty, and courage in the face of adversity, forever reminding us of what it means to be human.
