Question: Nancy and Rose are making bracelets, and there are eight beads in each bracelet. Nancy has 40 metal beads and 20 more pearl beads. Rose has 20 crystal beads and twice as many stone beads as crystal beads. How many bracelets can Nancy and Rose make?
Answer: Nancy has 40 + 20 = 60 pearl beads. So, Nancy has a total of 40 + 60 = 100 beads. Rose has 2 x 20 = 40 stone beads. So, Rose has 20 + 40 = 60 beads. Thus, Nancy and Rose have 100 + 60 = 160 beads altogether. Therefore, they can make 160 / 8 = 20 bracelets. The answer is 20.
[Question]Nori had 4 boxes of crayons with 8 crayons in each box. She gave 5 crayons to Mae and also give some crayons to Lea. How many more crayons did she give to Lea than Mae if she has only 15 crayons left?
[Answer]From the 4 boxes, Nori had 8 * 4 = 32 crayons. After giving 5 crayons to Mae, she had 32 - 5 = 27 crayons left. If she only has 15 crayons now, this means she gave Lea 27 - 15 = 12 crayons. Hence, Lea has 12 - 5 = 7 more crayons than Mae. The answer is 7.
Q: Marissa is serving her kids lunch. Each kid gets a burger with 400 calories and 5 carrot sticks with 20 calories each, and some cookies with 50 calories each. Marissa wants each kid to eat a total of 750 calories for lunch. How many cookies does each kid get?
A: First figure out how many total calories come from the carrots by multiplying the calories per carrot by the number of carrots: 20 calories / carrot * 5 carrots = 100 calories. Then subtract the calories the kids have already eaten from the goal number of calories to find out how many more total calories they should eat: 750 calories - 400 calories - 100 calories = 250 calories. Then divide the total number of calories by the calories per cookie to find the number of cookies each kid gets: 250 calories / 50 calories / cookie = 5 cookies. The answer is 5.
Question: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?
Answer: If Mary collected twice the number of red marbles collected by Jenny, she got 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary, which is 60 + 20 = 80 red marbles. The total number of red marbles is 60 + 80 + 30 = 170 red marbles. If Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles collected by Jenny, then she got 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. Mary collected half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, thus 1 / 2 * 50 = 25 marbles. The total number of blue marbles collected is 50 + 25 + 25 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.
[Question]Erin works in the school cafeteria serving soup. Each bowl of soup has 10 ounces, and Erin can serve 5 bowls per minute. If the pot of soup has 6 gallons of soup, how long will it take Erin to serve all the soup, rounded to the nearest minute? (There are 128 ounces to a gallon.)
[Answer]First find the number of ounces Erin serves per minute: 10 ounces / bowl * 5 bowls / minute = 50 ounces / minute. Then find the number of ounces in the pot: 6 gallons * 128 ounces / gallon = 768 ounces. Then divide the total amount of soup by the amount of soup Erin serves per minute: 768 minutes / 50 ounces / minute = 15.36 minutes, which rounds down to 15 minutes. The answer is 15.
