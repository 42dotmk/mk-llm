Genre: Comedy, Drama

Plot Overview:
"The Unintentional Head-Butt" takes place in the small, tight-knit town of Willowbrook, where everyone knows each other's name and gossip spreads like wildfire. The film revolves around the lives of Keenan, an aspiring actor working at the local theater, and Cooper, a local entrepreneur who runs a café. As much as Keenan dreams of making it big in the world of acting, he has never been successful at leaving Willowbrook behind to pursue his career.

One day, an up-and-coming movie director arrives in town, seeking to film an indie movie in a quaint location. This sends waves of excitement through the town, and naturally, Keenan is determined to bag a role in the film. Meanwhile, Cooper, who remains oblivious to the film's existence, dreams of expanding his business by somehow breaking into the movie industry and turning his café into a hotspot for film lovers.

Act I:
The story begins with Keenan at his day job, practicing his monologue for the theater's upcoming play. Cooper's café, aptly named "Cooper's Corner," is bustling with customers eager to discuss the potential movie filming in Willowbrook.

Keenan's talent and passion for acting are apparent, but his dismissive and overconfident attitude leads the theater's director to always cast him as an understudy. Keenan believes he's meant for a life beyond the small town stage, and upon hearing about the indie movie, decides to audition for a role in a last-ditch attempt to further his career.

Meanwhile, Cooper encourages his café visitors to support the film project in hopes that the influx of film enthusiasts will boost his business.

Act II:
Keenan attends the auditions for the film but finds it heavily guarded by the production team. In a desperate move to get noticed, Keenan creates an elaborate plan to infiltrate the set as a background actor. Through sheer luck, he manages to make it inside and catches the eye of the movie director during one of the scenes.

As the town buzzes with excitement about the movie, Cooper hosts a special event at "Cooper's Corner" to celebrate the anticipated film. Keenan attends the event, eager to share his news about almost landing a role. As he makes his way through the crowd, he accidentally head-butts Cooper while attempting to enter the restroom. 

This unfortunate accident spirals out of control, as the entire town assumes Keenan deliberately head-butted Cooper out of jealousy. The local media broadcasts the video of the event, turning it into a viral sensation and leaving both Keenan and Cooper embarrassed and at odds.

Act III:
Despite the controversy, the movie director sees something in Keenan that other professionals missed. The director visits the town once more and offers Keenan a supporting role in the upcoming film. Faced with the decision to leave Willowbrook, Keenan must also make amends with Cooper before setting out to pursue his dream.

Keenan's humility and regret over the incident at the café begin to soften Cooper's anger. As the two make peace, they devise a brilliant collaboration: to open a mini cinema inside Cooper's café that shows both Keenan's film and other transformative pieces. Cooper's dream of turning "Cooper's Corner" into a film paradise comes true, while Keenan finally gets his big break in the film industry.

Conclusion:
"The Unintentional Head-Butt" concludes with the premiere of the much-awaited indie movie at Cooper's Corner, with a large crowd of Willowbrook residents excitedly gathered to celebrate. Keenan and Cooper's bond now stronger than ever, they embrace, cherishing their newfound partnership and envisioning a brighter future for both themselves and their community.
