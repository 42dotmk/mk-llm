While the statement "Before the establishment of the Modern Greek state, the link between ancient and modern Greeks was emphasized by the scholars of Greek Enlightenment especially by Rigas Feraios" provides some information about the efforts of Greek Enlightenment scholars in bridging the gap between ancient and modern Greeks, it does not fully address the question about the foundation laid concerning the demographics of the Modern Greek Enlightenment Era.

The Modern Greek Enlightenment Era marked an important cultural, educational, and intellectual movement that spanned from the late 17th century to the 19th century. It served as a precursor to the Greek War of Independence (1821-1830) and played a vital role in shaping the modern Greek identity and nation-state. As part of the wider European Enlightenment movement, it sought to revive the intellectual and cultural aspects of ancient Greece, as well as to inspire national pride and aspirations for self-determination.

To better understand the foundation laid in terms of demographics during the Modern Greek Enlightenment Era, it is essential to consider the following aspects:

1. Education and intellectual centers: Across the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Europe, schools and educational establishments, often linked to major cities and ecclesiastical centers, played a significant role in connecting different regions and promoting the exchange of ideas. Cities like Venice, Vienna, Leipzig, and Paris became prominent centers for Greek scholars, while cities like Athens, Ioannina, and Patmos became key players in intellectual advancements within the Ottoman Empire.

2. Diaspora communities: Demographically, the Greek diaspora communities in key European cities like Venice, Vienna, and London provided invaluable support to the spread of Enlightenment principles. Their economic success, cultural engagement, and political lobbying contributed to both the growth of the movement and the convergence of various demographics around Enlightenment ideals.

3. Interaction with European scholars: Greek Enlightenment scholars had ongoing communication and exchanges with European scholars, philosophers, and writers, leading to the broader dissemination and incorporation of Enlightenment ideas into Greek culture and society. This, in turn, influenced the demographics and groups that became interested in and supportive of the Enlightenment, building bridges across previously existing social divides.

4. The clergyâ€™s role: In terms of demographics, the clergy played an essential role in the dissemination and promotion of Enlightenment ideas. As religious leaders and educators, they contributed to the development of the Greek national consciousness and identity, influencing a wide range of societal groups, from the aristocracy to the peasants in rural areas.

5. Secular and religious works: During the Modern Greek Enlightenment, there was a significant increase in the production of both secular and religious works in the vernacular language (Demotic Greek). This made the ideas of the Enlightenment more accessible to a broader audience and offered a vast range of people a connection to the ancient Greek heritage.

In conclusion, the foundation laid in terms of demographics during the Modern Greek Enlightenment Era was an intricate network of education and intellectual centers, diaspora communities, exchanges with European scholars, the influential role of the clergy, and the growing accessibility of secular and religious works in the vernacular language. These factors worked together to create diverse participation across different groups in society and helped pave the way for the revival and continuation of Greek culture and the eventual establishment of the Modern Greek state.
