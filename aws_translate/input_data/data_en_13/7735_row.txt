After both teams went three-and-out, the Patriots drove all the way to the Giants 8, but on 3rd-and-4 Brady was sacked by Craig Dahl for a 5-yard loss and Gostkowski gave the Patriots the lead with a 31-yard field goal. On the ensuing drive, the Giants drove all the way to the Patriots 16, but Manning was strip-sacked by Chandler Jones with Justin Coleman recovering at the Patriots 16. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Giants drove all the way to the Patriots 11, but settled for a 29-yard field goal by Josh Brown, tying the game 10-10. After a Patriots punt, the Giants engineered a 7 play, 74-yard drive, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown pass to Dwayne Harris, giving the Giants a 17-10 lead with 0:13 left in the half. Brady took a knee and the game went to halftime. The Giants took the opening kick of the second half and marched 60 yards to the Patriots 20 and Brown extended the Giants lead to 20-10 on a 38-yard field goal. Later, after forcing the Giant to a three-and-out, Amendola returned the punt 82 yards to the Giants 7. Three plays later, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run by Blount, trimming the deficit to 20-17. The Giants countered, driving all the way to the Patriots 35 with Brown draining a 53-yard field goal increasing the lead to 23-17. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Brady was strip-sacked by Jasper Brinkley with Markus Kuhn returning it 8 yards to the Patriots 31. Ninkovich sacked Manning for a 13-yard loss on the first play and the Patriots forced the Giants to a three-and-out. Starting at their own 14, two completions moved the Patriots to the 24. On the next play, Brady hit Gronk on a 76-yard catch-and-run for a touchdown, giving the Patriots a 24-23 lead. After a Giants three-and-out, facing a 3rd-and-4, Brady hit LaFell on a 54-yard bomb to the Giants 15. Four plays later, Blount scored on a 1-yard touchdown run, but the play was nullified by a holding penalty on David Andrews. Three plays later, Brady was intercepted at the Giants 1 by Trumaine McBride who returned it 2 yards to the 3. The Giants drove to the Patriots 5 and Manning hit Beckham for the go-ahead touchdown, but after official review, it was ruled that he stepped out of bounds before becoming a runner, and it was ruled an incomplete pass. After an incomplete pass, Manning was sacked for a 6-yard loss. Brown kicked a 29-yard field goal, giving the Giants a 26-24 lead with 1:47 remaining in the game. On the very first play, Brady was seemingly intercepted by Landon Collins on a deep pass attempt for Aaron Dobson, but Collins didn't maintain control and it was ruled an incomplete. After two straight incomplete passes, Brady hit Amendola for a 12-yard gain on 4th-and-10. The Patriots drove to the Giants 36, and Gostkowski made the 54-yard field goal after the kick seemed to be sailing right, giving the Patriots a 27-26 lead with&#160;:01 left. The Giants tried a lateral on the ensuing kick, but Beckham was knocked out of bounds at the Giants 11 and the Patriots escaped, keeping their undefeated season alive. With the win, the Patriots improved to 9-0 for the first time since their undefeated regular season of 2007, and snapped their three-game losing streak against the Giants. With a Bengals loss to the Texans the same week, the Patriots remain the only undefeated team in the AFC.
