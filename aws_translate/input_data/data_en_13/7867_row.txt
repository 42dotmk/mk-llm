Political parties first began forming in the United States during the early years of the nation's inception, a period marked by debates over the scope of governmental power, the balance of authority between the federal and state governments, and the interpretation of the United States Constitution. The First Party System, as it is known historically, emerged in the decade following the ratification of the Constitution in 1789 and can be traced back to two primary factions: the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans (originally known as the Anti-Federalists). These two groups had starkly different visions for the developing Republic, which fueled the formation of political parties in the nation.

The Federalists, led by prominent figures such as Alexander Hamilton and John Adams, favored a strong central government and believed that it was essential for the newly-formed United States to establish a sound financial system, invest in infrastructure, and promote economic growth through trade and industry. In terms of foreign policy, Federalists generally supported maintaining close ties with Great Britain. They were largely comprised of merchants, bankers, lawyers, and other professionals based in urban centers, particularly in the north, and they found strong support among those who advocated for the ratification of the Constitution.

On the other hand, the Democratic-Republicans, led by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, were critical of the concentration of power in the central government and argued for a more limited federal government that would protect individual liberties. They emphasized the importance of agrarianism, with a preference for an economy based on agriculture and rural life, while also advocating for states' rights and strict constructionism in their interpretation of the Constitution. Democratic-Republicans tended to be more sympathetic towards revolutionary France and harbored a mistrust for Great Britain. The party's support base included farmers, small landowners, and residents of the newly-formed western territories, with support also concentrated in the southern states.

The early years of political party formation were by no means a clear-cut or straightforward process, and the emergence of these factions took time to crystalize. The election of 1796 is commonly understood as the first instance in which these political parties played a major role in determining the outcome. The election saw John Adams, the Federalist candidate, narrowly defeat Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic-Republican candidate; however, a quirk in the process led to Jefferson becoming Adams' vice president.

The official and organized establishment of the political parties can be traced to the period between 1796 and 1800. One of the key moments was the formation of the Democratic-Republican Societies, which were set up in 1793-1794 in response to the Federalists' policies and to coordinate political activities in support of the Democratic-Republican vision. By the end of the 1790s, the distinctions and organization of these political parties had taken shape, creating a foundation for the U.S. political party system as we know it today.

It is important to note that the founding fathers, including President George Washington, initially frowned upon the formation of political parties, fearing that they would lead to factionalism, regionalism, and the undermining of the very fabric that held the young nation together. Yet, despite these concerns, the formation of political parties proved to be an inexorable development as the new nation sought to navigate its myriad internal and external challenges, laying the groundwork for the intricate and dynamic two-party system that endures in the United States to this day.
