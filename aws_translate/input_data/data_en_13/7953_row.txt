Information:  - A mobile phone is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency link while the user is moving within a telephone service area. The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator, which provides access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Most modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network architecture, and therefore mobile telephones are often also called "cellular telephones" or "cell phones". In addition to telephony, 2000s-era mobile phones support a variety of other services, such as text messaging, MMS, email, Internet access, short-range wireless communications (infrared, Bluetooth), business applications, gaming, and digital photography. Mobile phones which offer these and more general computing capabilities are referred to as smartphones.  - The blackberry is an edible fruit produced by many species in the "Rubus" genus in the Rosaceae family, hybrids among these species within the "Rubus" subgenus, and hybrids between the "Rubus" and "Idaeobatus" subgenera.

For example, the entire subgenus "Rubus" has been called the "Rubus fruticosus" aggregate, although the species "R. fruticosus" is considered a synonym of "R. plicatus".  - Trip Hawkins (born December 28, 1953) is an American entrepreneur and founder of Electronic Arts, The 3DO Company, and Digital Chocolate.  - The PlayStation 2 (abbreviated as PS2) is a home video game console that was developed by Sony Computer Entertainment.
