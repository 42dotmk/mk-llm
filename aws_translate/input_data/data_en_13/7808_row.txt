During the Great Depression, which took place from 1929 to the late 1930s, Canada had two prime ministers who served at various points during this period. Both leaders grappled with the severe economic challenges that the Great Depression brought to the country.

1. Richard Bedford Bennett (1930-1935):
Born on July 3, 1870, in Hopewell, Nova Scotia, Richard Bedford Bennett was the 11th Prime Minister of Canada. He held the position from August 7, 1930, to October 23, 1935, serving under the Conservative Party banner. Bennett's tenure fell at the beginning and peak of the Great Depression, which hit Canada significantly due to its dependence on raw material and agricultural exports that experienced steep declines in global demand and prices.

Bennett initially believed in classical economic theory, which prescribed minimal government intervention during economic crises. Consequently, he hesitated to adopt more expansive policies at the start of his term. As unemployment skyrocketed and the Depression's severity deepened, public pressure and frustration grew, prompting Bennett to change his approach.

In 1935, Bennett introduced a series of reform initiatives, collectively known as the "Bennett New Deal." These policies included the introduction of unemployment insurance, a progressive income tax system, minimum wages, limits on work hours, and regulations governing working conditions. However, Bennett's New Deal was perceived as too little, too late by many Canadians. The discontent led to the Conservative Party's defeat in the 1935 general election, and Bennett was replaced by the Liberal Party leader, William Lyon Mackenzie King.

2. William Lyon Mackenzie King (1921-1926, 1926-1930, 1935-1948):
Born in Berlin (now Kitchener), Ontario, on December 17, 1874, William Lyon Mackenzie King was the 10th and longest-serving Prime Minister in Canadian history. King served as Prime Minister in three non-consecutive terms: from 1921 to 1926, 1926 to 1930, and 1935 to 1948. As a result, he led the nation both before and during the Great Depression, serving under the Liberal Party.

King was the Prime Minister at the onset of the Great Depression but lost the 1930 election to R.B. Bennett, partly due to Canada's worsening economic conditions. Despite being in opposition during Bennett's term, King continued to maintain a high level of political engagement and remained a prominent figure in Canadian politics.

Upon returning to power in 1935, King took a more active approach to mitigating the impacts of the Depression. Under his leadership, the Canadian government implemented various relief programs and employment initiatives, such as public works projects and the establishment of the Bank of Canada in 1935. Unlike Bennett, who was seen as out of touch with the population's needs, King was better at reading the public sentiment and was empathetic toward the difficulties faced by ordinary Canadians during the Great Depression.

Throughout his tenure, King maintained a close relationship with the U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was concurrently executing the "New Deal" policies to combat the Depression in the United States. Both leaders engaged in collaborative efforts to revive their respective nations' economies and alleviate the hardship faced by their citizens.

In summary, Richard Bedford Bennett and William Lyon Mackenzie King were the two Prime Ministers of Canada during the Great Depression. While Bennett struggled with the crisis and saw his popularity plummet due to his initial reluctance to enact comprehensive reforms, King was able to regain public support and navigate the country through the latter half of the Depression with a more proactive approach to economic recovery and social welfare.
