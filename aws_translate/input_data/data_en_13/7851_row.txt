Question: Martha is making centerpieces for her Thanksgiving dinner. There are six centerpieces, and each centerpiece uses 8 roses, twice as many orchids as roses, and a certain number of lilies. If Martha wants to spend $2700 total, and each flower costs $15, how many lilies will she put in each centerpiece?
Answer: First figure out how many total flowers Martha is going to buy by dividing her total spending by the price per flower: $2700 / $15 / flower = 180 flowers. Now figure out how many flowers are in each centerpiece by dividing the total number of flowers by the number of centerpieces: 180 flowers / 6 centerpieces = 30 flowers / centerpiece. Now figure out how many orchids are in each centerpiece by multiplying the number of roses per centerpiece by 2: 8 roses / centerpiece * 2 = 16 orchids / centerpiece. Now subtract the number of roses and orchids per centerpiece from the total number of flowers per centerpiece to find the number of lilies per centerpiece: 30 flowers - 16 orchids - 8 roses = 6 lilies. The answer is 6.
[Question]Carrie harvested 200 tomatoes and 350 carrots on her farm. If she can sell a tomato for $1 and a carrot for $1.50, how much money can she make if she sells all of her tomatoes and carrots?
[Answer]From selling her tomatoes, she can make 200 * $1 = $200. From selling her carrots, she can make 350 * $1.50 = $525. The total amount of money she can make is $200 + $525 = $725. The answer is 725.
Q: In a Volleyball competition, Lizzie was able to score 4 points. Nathalie's score is 3 more than Lizzie's score and Aimee's score is twice the score of Lizzie and Nathalie combined. The rest of the points were made by their teammates. If the whole team was able to score 50 points, how many points did their teammates make?
A: Nathalie's score is 4 + 3 = 7. And the total points of Nathalie and Lizzie when combined is 7 + 4 = 11. So, the total score of Aimee is 11 x 2 = 22. Lizzie, Nathalie, and Aimee's total score is 22 + 11 = 33. Therefore, their teammates were able to score 50 - 33 = 17. The answer is 17.
Question: It's Yvette's turn to treat herself and her three best friends to a round of ice cream sundaes. Alicia orders the peanut butter sundae for $7.50. Brant orders the Royal banana split sundae for $10.00. Josh orders the death by chocolate sundae for $8.50 and Yvette orders the cherry jubilee sundae for $9.00. She leaves her waiter a 20% tip. How much will her final bill be?
Answer: Yvette spent 7.50 + 10 + 8.5 + 9 = $35.00 on ice cream sundaes. Her bill comes to $35.00 and she leaves a 20% tip for the waiter so that's 35 * .20 = $7.00. The bill was $35.00 and she added a $7.00 tip for a total of 35 + 7 = $42.00. The answer is 42.
[Question]A teacher asked Adelaide, Ephraim, and Kolton to buy ducks and monitor their growth patterns and features for their science class. Adelaide bought twice the number of ducks that Ephraim bought, while Ephraim bought 45 fewer ducks than Kolton. If Adelaide bought 30 ducks, what's the average number of ducks the three bought?
[Answer]If Adelaide bought 30 ducks, Ephraim bought 30 ducks / 2 = 15 ducks. Since Ephraim bought 45 fewer ducks than Kolton, Kolton bought 45 ducks + 15 ducks = 60 ducks. The total number of ducks the three bought is 60 ducks + 15 ducks + 30 ducks = 105 ducks. The average number of ducks each bought is 105 ducks / 3 people = 35 ducks / person. The answer is 35.
