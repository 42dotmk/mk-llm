The immediate cause involved the rights of Christian minorities in the Holy Land, which was a part of the Ottoman Empire. The French promoted the rights of Roman Catholics, while Russia promoted those of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of Britain and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at Ottoman expense. It has widely been noted that the causes, in one case involving an argument over a key, have never revealed a "greater confusion of purpose", yet led to a war noted for its "notoriously incompetent international butchery."  - The Eastern Orthodox Church, also known as the Orthodox Church, or officially as the Orthodox Catholic Church, is the second largest Christian church and one of the oldest current religious institutions in the world.

It practices what it understands to be the original Christian faith and maintains the sacred tradition passed down from the apostles.  - Nicholas I (  I  , r Nikolai I Pavlovich ; 6 July ( O.S. 25 June ) 1796 -- 2 March ( O.S. 18 February ) 1855 ) was the Emperor of Russia from 1825 until 1855 .

It was a reactionary policy based on orthodoxy in religion , autocracy in government , and Russian nationalism . He was the younger brother of his predecessor , Alexander I. Nicholas inherited his brother 's throne despite the failed Decembrist revolt against him and went on to become the most reactionary of all Russian leaders . His aggressive foreign policy involved many expensive wars , having a disastrous effect on the empire 's finances . He was successful against Russia 's neighbouring southern rivals as he seized the last territories in the Caucasus held by Persia ( comprising modern day Armenia and Azerbaijan ) by successfully ending the Russo - Persian War ( 1826 -- 28 ) .
