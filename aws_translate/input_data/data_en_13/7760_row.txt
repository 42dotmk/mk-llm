[Question]At Sarah's job 60% of the employees are women and the rest are men. Of the men, 75% have a college degree and 8 do not. How many women work at Sarah's company?
[Answer]25% of men at the job don't have a college degree because 100 - 75 = 25. There are 32 men at the company because 8 / .25 = 32. 40% of the employees are men because 100 - 60 = 40. The company has 80 workers because 32 / .4 = 80. There are 48 women at the company because 80 - 32 = 48. The answer is 48.
Q: Chandra is going on a monster hunt. After a big storm, there have been lost monsters all around the castle grounds for the last 5 days. Chandra wants to rope them all up and return them to the swamps where they will be the most comfortable. On the first day she saw 2 monsters near the castle walls. Every day after that she saw double the amount as the day before. After 5 days how many monsters does she need to lead back to the swamps?
A: On the first day Chandra saw 2 monsters and on day 2 she saw twice that amount, 2 x 2 = 4 monsters seen on day 2. On day 3 she saw double that amount of monsters, 4 x 2 = 8. On day 4 she saw double that amount of monsters, 8 x 2 = 16. On day 5 she saw double that amount of monsters, 16 x 2 = 32. Altogether Chandra saw 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 lost monsters = 62 total lost monsters that Chandra needs to lead back to the swamps. The answer is 62.
Question: Casey is going to stay at a motel while she works her summer job as a ski instructor. The hotel charges $280/week or $1000/month. If Casey will be staying 3 months, each with exactly 4 weeks, how much money does she save by paying monthly?
Answer: First find the number of weeks Casey stays: 3 months * 4 weeks / month = 12 weeks. Then multiply that number by the weekly rate to find how much she would pay weekly: 12 weeks * $280 / week = $3360. Then multiply the number of months she stays by the monthly rate to find how much she pays monthly: $1000 / month * 3 months = $3000. Then subtract that number from the total amount she pays if she pays weekly to find her savings: $3360 - $3000 = $360. The answer is 360.
[Question]In a single day, it rained for many hours. From 2pm to 4pm, it rained at a rate of 4 inches per hour. From 4pm to 7pm, it rained at a rate of 3 inches per hour. And from 7pm to 9pm, it rained at a rate of 0.5 inches per hour. If the rain gauge started out the day already containing 2 inches of rainwater, how many inches of water will the gauge contain at 9pm?
[Answer]From 2pm to 4pm is 4 - 2 = 2 hours. Thus, from 2 - 4pm, raining at 4 inches per hour, it added 8 inches to the rain gauge. From 4pm to 7pm is 7 - 4 = 3 hours. Thus, from 4 - 7pm, raining at a rate of 3 inches per hour, it added 3 * 3 = 9 inches to the rain gauge. From 7pm to 9pm is 9 - 7 = 2 hours. Thus, from 7 - 9pm, raining at a rate of 0.5 inches per hour, it added 2 * 0.5 = 1 inch to the gauge. If the gauge originally contained 2 inches of water, by 9pm the gauge contained 2 + 8 + 9 + 1 = 20 inches of water. The answer is 20.
Q: Mitch is a freelancer, she works 5 hours every day from Monday to Friday and 3 hours every Saturday and Sunday. If she earns $3 per hour and earns double on weekends, how much does she earn every week?
A: Mitch earns 5 x $3 = $15 every weekday. So, she earns $15 x 5 = $75 from Monday to Friday. And she earns $3 x 2 = $6 per hour every weekend. Hence, the total amount she earns every weekend is $6 x 3 = $18. So, she earns $18 x 2 = $36 every Saturday and Sunday. Therefore, the total amount she earns every week is $75 + $36 = $111. The answer is 111.
