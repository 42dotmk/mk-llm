The data provided, consisting of terms "London," "governingBody," and "Greater London Authority," refers to the political and administrative landscape of the city of London, a prominent metropolis in the United Kingdom known for its rich history as well as status as a global financial center. The ensuing description will delve into London's scale, structure, and the management framework upheld by the Greater London Authority (GLA).

Firstly, it is essential to understand London as a city. Situated in southeastern England, along the River Thames, London is the largest city in the UK and serves as the nation's political, economic, and cultural hub. Dating back to its founding by the Romans in AD 43, the city has witnessed numerous events critical to the shaping of modern-day society, such as the British monarchy's reign and the rise of the British Empire. Presently, it is a highly urbanized and densely populated area, with over 9 million inhabitants calling it home. The metropolitan area spreads across 32 boroughs, including the two global financial centers, the City of London and Canary Wharf.

To manage this sprawling and diverse city, a governing body is necessary to oversee policies, legislation, and development. This role is undertaken by the Greater London Authority, the central administrative unit responsible for the city's strategic development, coordination, and some of the public services like transport, police, and fire emergency services. The GLA is a unique entity in local government, distinct from the 32 individual London borough councils in charge of minor administrative functions like waste collection, public parks, and smaller-scale planning and development.

The Greater London Authority, established in 2000 by the UK Parliament via the Greater London Authority Act, functions as a regional authority and consists of two primary components. These include the Mayor of London, an elected official serving as the executive head of the organization, and the London Assembly, comprising 25 elected members who scrutinize and amend the plans and actions of the Mayor. This structure often fosters a climate where policies are debated, refined, and approved, providing checks and balances on the decision-making process.

The GLA, under the governance of the Mayor of London, has several key responsibilities to ensure London runs smoothly and efficiently. These obligations encompass areas such as economic planning, environmental management, housing, and transportation. For instance, Transport for London (TfL), a sub-division of the GLA, manages, and oversees the city's public transportation network, which includes the iconic London Underground. Furthermore, the GLA is charged with developing strategic plans like the London Plan, the Mayor's Transport Strategy, and the Environment Strategy, which are integral to the city's growth and sustainability.

Moreover, the Greater London Authority liaises with other organizations and tiers of government, including the UK government, the European Union (before Brexit), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to implement and develop policies and collaborative efforts in areas of mutual concern. This cooperation may encompass topics such as national and global policy changes, funding, or legislation that directly affects the city's administration and constituents.

In summary, the data provided refers to the city of London and its unique administration through the Greater London Authority, which is in charge of essential citywide policies and strategic development. As a critical component of the United Kingdom's political and economic fabric, the Greater London Authority maintains the functioning of one of the world's most influential and dynamic cities.
