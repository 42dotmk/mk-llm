Reasoning and answer: Since, three years from now, Tabitha will have 8 different colors in her hair, this year she has 8 - 3 = 5 colors in her hair. Since she had 2 colors in her hair at the age of 15, she has added 5 - 2 = 3 colors since she was 15 years old. Since she ads one color per year, 3 added colors = 3 added years. Thus, currently, she is 15 + 3 = 18 years old.
The answer: 18

First find the total number of antacids Nancy takes after eating Indian food per week: 3 antacids / day * 3 days / week = 9 antacids / week. Then find the total number of antacids Nancy takes after eating Mexican food per week: 2 antacids / day * 2 days / week = 4 antacids / week. Then find the number of days she doesn't eat Indian food or Mexican food: 7 days / week - 3 days / week - 2 days / week = 2 days / week. Then find the total number of antacids Nancy takes per week: 9 antacids / week + 4 antacids / week + 2 antacids / week = 15 antacids / week. Then multiply her weekly antacid consumption by the number of weeks per month to find her monthly consumption: 15 antacids / week * 4 week / month = 60 antacids / month.
The answer: 60
Reverse engineering the question: Nancy takes 3 antacids per day when she eats Indian food, 2 antacids per day when she eats Mexican food, and 1 antacid per day otherwise. If Nancy eats Indian three times a week and Mexican twice a week, how many antacids does she take per month?

Reasoning and answer: Find the number of students who got their degree by multiplying: 804 students * 75% = 603 students. Then find the number of students who didn't pass their exams by subtracting this number from the total: 804 students - 603 students = 201 students.
The answer: 201

The number of students in the marching band is 600 / 5 = 120 students. The number of students that play a brass instrument is 120 / 2 = 60 students. The number of students that play the saxophone is 60 / 5 = 12 students. The number of students that play the alto saxophone is 12 / 3 = 4 students.
The answer: 4
Reverse engineering the question: At Roosevelt high school there are 600 students in the senior class. A fifth of the students are in the marching band. Of the students in the marching band, half of them play a brass instrument. Of the students that play a brass instrument, a fifth of them play the saxophone. Of the students that play the saxophone, a third of them play the alto saxophone. How many students play the alto saxophone?

Reasoning and answer: Out of the 10 books, 10 x 2 / 5 = 4 are reading books. While 10 x 3 / 10 = 3 are math books. There are 3 - 1 = 2 science books. So, the total number of reading, math, and science books is 4 + 3 + 2 = 9. Thus, there is only 10 - 9 = 1 history book.
The answer: 1

Question: There are 10 books on the table. Two-fifths of them are reading books and three-tenths of them are math books. There is one fewer science book than math books and the rest are history books. How many history books are there?

Reasoning and answer: They earned 6 x $3 = $18 for the shoes they sold. They earned 18 x $2 = 36 for the shirts they sold. So, they earned $18 + $36 = $54 in total for the clothing they sold. Therefore, Sab and Dane earned $54 / 2 = $27 each.
The answer: 27
