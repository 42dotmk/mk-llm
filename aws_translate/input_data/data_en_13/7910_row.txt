During the 1980s, Afghanistan witnessed a fierce conflict between the Soviet Union and the Afghan resistance fighters known as the Mujahideen. This long-lasting battle, also called the Soviet-Afghan War, lasted from December 1979 to February 1989. Apart from the indigenous Afghan resistance fighters, several countries and entities backed and supported the Afghan Mujahideen â€“ notably, the United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and China.

1. The United States: The US played a significant role in supporting the Afghan Mujahideen during the Soviet-Afghan War. As part of its foreign policy goals to counter Soviet expansion and influence, the US provided financial aid, military equipment, and intelligence support to the Afghan resistance fighters. The CIA launched Operation Cyclone, a program that funneled billions of dollars' worth of arms, ammunition, and equipment to the Afghan Mujahideen. These support efforts were mostly conducted through Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Additionally, the US provided humanitarian aid to Afghan refugees who fled to Pakistan and Iran during the war.

2. Pakistan: Serving as the frontline state in the conflict, Pakistan played a central role in assisting the Afghan Mujahideen. With its close geographical proximity, Pakistan became both a safe haven for Afghan refugees and a base for Mujahideen fighters. The ISI was instrumental in distributing funds, arms, and military training to various Mujahideen factions. Pakistan's role was crucial to the success of the Afghan resistance, as it provided the necessary logistical support and extensive, cross-border supply routes.

3. Saudi Arabia: Riyadh played a key role in financing the Afghan resistance against the Soviet Union. The Saudi government matched US financial contributions on a dollar-for-dollar basis, significantly increasing the funds available to the Mujahideen. Moreover, Saudi intelligence agencies cooperated with the US and Pakistan in facilitating arms shipments, logistics, and other support. Saudi Arabia also encouraged Muslim volunteers from various countries to join the Afghan resistance in the name of Islamic solidarity and jihad.

4. The United Kingdom: The UK also participated in backing the Afghan Mujahideen, primarily through its intelligence services. The British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) and the SAS (Special Air Service) provided financial support, training, and equipment to the resistance fighters. British operatives aided in training the Mujahideen in areas such as guerrilla warfare, intelligence gathering, sabotage techniques, and communications. The cooperation between British and American intelligence agencies significantly bolstered the Mujahideen's efforts against Soviet forces.

5. China: Alongside the US, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia, China played a crucial yet discreet role in supporting the Afghan resistance. China provided military aid to the Mujahideen, including heavy weapons, ammunition, and logistics support. It was motivated by a desire to counter Soviet influence in the region and thus viewed the Soviet invasion as a threat to its own interests. In addition to these material contributions, China enabled a vital flow of arms and assistance through its territory to the Afghan Mujahideen.

In summary, the Afghan resistance against the Soviet Union in the 1980s received significant support from various international allies. The United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and China provided financial, military, and intelligence assistance to the Afghan Mujahideen, enabling a prolonged and ultimately successful resistance campaign. This multifaceted international effort was instrumental in the eventual withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan in 1989.
