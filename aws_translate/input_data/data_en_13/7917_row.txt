Genre: Science Fiction, Adventure, Drama

Plot:

Berus and Thon are two best friends who work for the Temporal Enforcement and Preservation Agency (TEPA), an organization dedicated to maintaining the balance and stability of the space-time continuum. The duo, known for their exceptional skills in handling time-related emergencies, often embark on dangerous missions to prevent catastrophes and safeguard humanity's history.

As our story begins, Berus and Thon return from a time-bending mission, only to find that they have become fugitives of their own time period. Unbeknownst to them, while they were away on their mission, a shadowy figure invaded TEPA headquarters and planted incriminating evidence, framing Berus and Thon for heinous crimes against history. The unknown assailant manipulated past events, leading to falsified records and memories that implicated the two friends in a sequence of catastrophic events that threatened the very existence of the future world.

Arrested by their fellow temporal agents, Berus and Thon are put on trial to defend themselves against the overwhelming evidence crafted by the mysterious orchestrator. With TEPA's top prosecutors bent on proving the duo's guilt, Berus and Thon find themselves in an uphill battle to clear their names. The stakes are high: if found guilty, they will face excommunication from TEPA and eternal imprisonment in a time-loop void, which would effectively erase them from history.

Determined to expose the truth, Berus and Thon devise a secret plan to unravel the layers of deception and unveil the identity of the invisible villain. As the trial progresses, the friends make efficient use of their intimate knowledge of time travel, combing through past events for clues and employing time-bending strategies to counter the fabricated evidence against them.

Throughout their gripping investigation, Berus and Thon uncover a web of deceit and political intrigue within TEPA itself. They reveal that several high-ranking officials within the organization have been corrupted, pushing for personal gains and power by playing with the very fabric of time. This discovery paints an even bleaker future for them as they appear to be utterly alone in their fight for justice.

As the trial reaches its climax, an unexpected ally emerges: Rew, a rookie temporal agent who stumbled upon a critical piece of evidence, pointing to a malicious time-traveler known as the Time Serpent. Berus and Thon present this evidence at the 11th hour, provoking a confrontation with the Time Serpent, who reveals himself to be the villainous mastermind behind the entire conspiracy.

The trial is suspended, and a high-stakes pursuit across the continuum ensues, as Berus, Thon, and Rew engage the Time Serpent in a vicious battle of skill and wits. Their intense conflict culminates in a showdown at the dawn of the universe, the very moment the Time Serpent seeks to corrupt to achieve total control over the course of history.

With their combined efforts, the three heroes successfully vanquish the Time Serpent, undoing his nefarious manipulations and restoring the timeline to its original state. Berus and Thon are exonerated of all charges, as the TEPA leadership is purged and reformed under the new guidance of the truth-seeking heroes.

"The Chronicles of Berus and Thon: The Trial of Times" ends on a hopeful note as the duo takes on new responsibilities within TEPA, with an aim to reshape the organization and ensure that no such conspiracies can take place in the future. As they, along with their new friend Rew, forge ahead to explore the vast intricacies of time, the film leaves audiences eagerly anticipating the endless adventures that lie ahead.
