4.1.1. The history of development The issue of rational water resource management and their use in the Aral Sea basin emerged as early as the 1970s-1980s (Frame 4.1).

The emergence of the problem of rational utilization and management of water resources in the Aral Sea basin can be traced back to the 1970s and 1980s. During this period, the growing demand for water resources in the region, coupled with inadequate policies and practices, led to significant environmental degradation and the resulting socio-economic effects.

The Aral Sea, once the fourth largest lake in the world, has been shrinking at an alarming rate, mainly due to the excessive diversion of water from its two primary sources, the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers. This diversion was primarily driven by the intensive agricultural development, particularly of irrigation for cotton production, in the Soviet period.

In the 1960s, the Soviet government had sanctioned major irrigation projects, including the construction of a canal network that diverted large volumes of water from the two main rivers to agricultural fields. This increased the demand for water resources manifold in the region, leading to over-extraction and inefficient use of water. The situation was further exacerbated by the lack of effective water management and monitoring systems in place.

As a result, by the 1970s and 1980s, the Aral Sea began to experience severe environmental degradation, including a decrease in its area and volume, the increased salt concentration in the water, and the progressive disappearance of its endemic flora and fauna. These changes had profound ripple effects on the surrounding region, such as soil salinization, loss of biodiversity, a decline in fish stocks, increased desertification, and negative impacts on human health and welfare.

Recognizing the critical state of the Aral Sea basin and the urgent need for action, the international community started to take notice of the issue. From the mid-1980s onwards, numerous conferences, summits, and workshops were organized to address the issue. These efforts culminated in the establishment of the Interstate Commission for Water Coordination (ICWC) in 1992, and the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS) in 1993, which aimed to facilitate cooperation among the Central Asian states to address the pressing water management issues in the region.

Since then, various initiatives and projects have been implemented to restore and improve the condition of the Aral Sea basin. These efforts have primarily focused on improving water management infrastructures, promoting more efficient water use, and restoring ecosystems in the affected areas. Additionally, the international community has also provided financial and technical assistance to help the countries in the region address the complex challenges.

Despite the significant progress made over the past decades, the Aral Sea basin remains under tremendous stress due to the ongoing water resource challenges and related environmental and socio-economic consequences. To ensure a sustainable future for the region, it is crucial for the international community and the countries in the basin to continue working together on coherent and long-term measures to improve water management, conserve the ecosystems, and promote sustainable development.

In conclusion, the issue of rational water resource management and their use in the Aral Sea basin emerged as early as the 1970s-1980s as a result of inadequate policies and practices during the Soviet era. Since then, various initiatives and measures have been implemented to address the issue, and it continues to be a priority for the region and the international community to ensure a sustainable future.
