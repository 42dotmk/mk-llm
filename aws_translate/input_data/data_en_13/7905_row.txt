Plot: 

Act I:
Abigail, a highly-touted psychiatrist with a seemingly perfect life, resides in the idyllic coastal town she and Gordon, her childhood friend, grew up in. Abigail has dedicated her career to helping others, and as a result, she is highly respected by her peers and the community as a whole. Gordon, on the other hand, is a struggling writer who often finds solace in the supernatural and has developed an obsession with the occult.

One day, a series of inexplicable events begin to unfold in the town. Mysterious disappearances, unnatural deaths, and supernatural occurrences shake the community to its core. Media frenzy and paranoia grip the town as the locals start to point fingers, searching for a source, human or otherwise, to explain these terrifying events.

Act II:
As the hysteria spreads, Abigail's calm demeanor and concrete reasoning allow her to bat away accusations of any supernatural involvement. However, Gordon's roots in the seemingly obscure occult make him an easy target for the townspeople's suspicion. In an attempt to clear both their names, Abigail and Gordon team up, using their unique skills and insights to delve into the core of the bizarre, dark phenomena engulfing their town.

Their investigation uncovers a hidden network of secret societies and dark forces operating in their town, which aims to control the inhabitants for nefarious purposes. Abigail and Gordon discover that the society members participate in sacrificial rituals, made in exchange for their safety and prosperity.

They soon narrow down the possible culprits and confront the society's leaders, hoping to expose the truth to the town. In a shocking turn of events, they find out that Abigail's late mentor, Dr. Lancaster, was a core member of this shadowy group.

Act III:
As the conspiracy unravels, new pieces of evidence start to point toward Abigail's connection to the society. Gordon finds out about Abigailâ€™s mentor's involvement in the group and begins to suspect her motives. Abigail denies any involvement, but doubts begin to seep into their friendship. The trust between Abigail and Gordon starts to recede as Abigail struggles to maintain her innocence.

In the climactic confrontation with the secret society's leader, it is revealed that Dr. Lancaster had passed on the leadership mantle to Abigail before his death. Abigail, however, was unaware of this responsibility and had no knowledge of her mentor's dark side. Realizing the web of lies surrounding her, she is left to confront her fate.

Feeling utterly betrayed and lost, Gordon turns against Abigail, leaving her to fend for herself against the town's rage and the secret society's deadly ambitions. As their friendship falls apart, Abigail must choose between accepting the leadership role within the secret society or risking everything to fight back, save the town from the darkness, and heal the rift between her and Gordon.

The Reckoning of Abigail is a riveting psychological thriller packed with deceit, conspiracy, and the supernatural, forcing two friends to question the very nature of their relationship and morality itself. As old secrets are laid bare, and an entire town's fate hangs in the balance, the plot takes each character on a treacherous journey to expose the truth, even at the cost of their friendship.
