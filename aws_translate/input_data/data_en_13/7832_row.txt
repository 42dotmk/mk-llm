The Delhi Sultanate (Persian: دهلی سلطان, Urdu: دہلی سلیٹیٹ) was a Muslim sultanate based mostly in Delhi that stretched over large parts of the Indian subcontinent for 320 years (1206 -- 1526). Five dynasties ruled over the Delhi Sultanate sequentially: the Mamluk dynasty (1206 -- 90), the Khalji dynasty (1290 -- 1320), the Tughlaq dynasty (1320 -- 1414), the Sayyid dynasty (1414 -- 51), and the Lodi dynasty (1451 -- 1526).

## question
The design of the Eiffel Tower was the product of Maurice Koechlin and Émile Nouguier, two senior engineers working for the Compagnie des Établissements Eiffel, after discussion about a suitable centrepiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution. Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting Observatory built in New York City in 1853. In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as "a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals". Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of company's architectural department, to contribute to the design. Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.

What was the reason for the eiffel tower?
