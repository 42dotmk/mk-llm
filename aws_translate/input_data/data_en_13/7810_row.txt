Eric was going away on a business trip for a week. Dennis, being a good friend and a cat lover himself, immediately agreed to help Eric out.

Before Eric left for his trip, he provided Dennis with all the necessary details and instructions to ensure the cat's comfort and well-being during his absence. First and foremost, he reminded Dennis that their cat, affectionately named Whiskers, was diabetic and required daily insulin injections. 

To further guide Dennis in this important task, Eric showed him the prescribed dosage and how to administer the injections using a special insulin pen. Alongside this, there was a carefully prepared timetable so that the injections would be given at consistent times each day. This would allow Whiskers' body to maintain a stable blood sugar level, ensuring her health did not suffer.

Moreover, Eric explained the specifics of Whiskers' diet. He brought out various cans of specialty cat food, specifically designed for diabetic cats, and went into detail about how much and when to feed her. It was essential to keep her diet consistent and avoid giving her any treats not approved by her veterinarian. To help Dennis in this aspect, Eric had organized everything in a practical and efficient manner. He had labeled the food with times and dates to prevent any confusion or deviation from Whiskers' regular feeding habits.

Next up was Whiskers' quirky behavior. Eric mentioned that she had a shy personality, quickly becoming nervous in unfamiliar situations. Dennis was advised to approach her calmly and gently so that she could grow accustomed to his presence. Eric also pointed out Whiskers' favorite toys and hiding spots so that Dennis could engage with her constructively, helping her overcome her anxiety and fear.

In addition, Eric stressed the necessity of maintaining Whiskers' hygiene. He explained that she had a strict routine of being groomed every second day with a gentle brush and could become distressed if this didn't happen. He handed Dennis a grooming kit, which consisted of a soft brush, a flea comb, and nail clippers for Whiskers' claws. Eric took the time to demonstrate the proper techniques for using these tools, ensuring that Dennis felt comfortable taking care of Whiskers' grooming needs.

As the discussion progressed, Eric highlighted that Whiskers had a sensitive stomach, and therefore, it was important to keep her litter box clean. He recommended cleaning it at least twice a day to avoid any unpleasant surprises. In order to avoid triggering Whiskers' sensitivity, Eric had stocked up on litter that was specifically designed for cats with sensitive stomachs.

Lastly, Eric provided Dennis with the contact details of Whiskers' veterinarian and instructed him to call immediately in case of any emergency. He left a generous budget for Dennis to use in case any unexpected expenses occurred while he was away. Dennis assured Eric that he would care for Whiskers as if she were his own, adhering to all the detailed instructions and offering her the best possible care during Eric's absence.

With a heavy heart, Eric left for his business trip, knowing that Whiskers was in good hands. Meanwhile, Dennis, now equipped with a greater understanding and appreciation of Whiskers' special needs, was eager to provide the loving and attentive care that she required. Over the course of the week, Dennis and Whiskers started to bond, as the shy feline learned to trust her new caretaker. They shared playtime, cuddles, and companionship, ensuring that Whiskers continued to thrive during Eric's absence. When Eric returned, he was relieved to find Whiskers content, healthy, and well-cared for, and offered his deepest gratitude to Dennis for being such a steadfast and attentive friend.
