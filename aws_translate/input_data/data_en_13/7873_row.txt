Consent and Amendment to End of Life Care 

I, [Your Full Name], born on [Your Date of Birth], give my full consent to the following medical directives related to my end-of-life care. I trust that these preferences will be honored by my healthcare providers, family members, and any other parties involved in my care.

1. Life-sustaining treatments:

    a) I consent to receive all necessary life-sustaining treatments, such as mechanical ventilation, CPR, and intravenous fluids, until my medical team deems these measures will no longer benefit my health condition.

    b) However, if my physicians determine that I am in a permanent vegetative state, irreversible coma, or any other condition in which the likelihood of recovery of consciousness is remote, I do not wish to receive life-sustaining treatments except as necessary to provide comfort and relief from pain.

2. Use of medications:

    a) I consent to the administration of pain-relieving medication, even if it may potentially shorten my life.

    b) I do not consent to treatments or medications that may prolong my life if they would impose significant discomfort, suffering, or severely compromise my quality of life.

3. Medical procedures and interventions:

    a) I consent to all reasonable medical procedures and interventions to manage my symptoms and alleviate suffering.

    b) If it is determined that I have an incurable or irreversible condition, I request that any medical interventions or procedures that solely prolong the dying process be withheld or discontinued, including feeding tubes and artificial hydration.

4. Organ and tissue donation:

    a) I consent to donate my organs and tissue for transplantation, should they be deemed suitable and compatible.

    b) Once all life-sustaining treatments have been ceased or withheld, I request that any life support systems be maintained until the organ donation process is complete.

Amendment:

I reserve the right to amend any of the directives mentioned above in the future, as long as I remain legally competent to do so. If any changes occur, I will execute a new consent form to replace this one and distribute updated copies to relevant parties.

In conclusion, I want to emphasize the importance of following my end-of-life preferences as discussed in this document. I trust that my wishes will be handled with the utmost respect and dignity, and I am grateful for your understanding.

Sincerely,

[Your Full Name]
