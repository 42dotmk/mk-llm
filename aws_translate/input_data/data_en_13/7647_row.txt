MS-13, also known as Mara Salvatrucha, is a transnational criminal organization and street gang that originally formed in Los Angeles, California, in the United States during the late 1980s. The gang, which is primarily composed of Central American immigrants and descendants from El Salvador, was created as a way to protect Salvadoran immigrants from other, more established gangs in Los Angeles. Many of the original members were refugees who had fled El Salvador during the country's civil war in the 1980s. As a result, these individuals brought with them a legacy of violence and trauma that played a significant role in the development of MS-13.

Over time, the gang expanded its presence across the United States and to other countries, particularly in Central America. This expansion was facilitated, in part, by deportations of criminal individuals back to their home countries, which allowed MS-13 to establish a foothold in countries such as El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. As a result, the gang evolved from a localized, street-level organization to a transnational criminal organization engaged in a wide range of criminal activities including drug trafficking, human trafficking, extortion, and murder.

Regarding the statement "Members of MS distinguish themselves by tattoos covering the body and also often the face, as well as the use of their own sign language," this would be a reasonable, albeit incomplete, characterization of the gang's identity and distinguishing features. MS-13 members are indeed well-known for their distinctive tattoos, which often cover a significant portion of the individual's body and can even include facial tattoos. These tattoos often incorporate symbols and imagery associated with the gang, such as the numbers "13" or "MS," as well as images of weapons, skulls, devils, and other elements intended to signify the group's violent and criminal nature.

In addition to tattoos, MS-13 members have also been known to employ specialized hand signs and gestures as a form of communication and identification. This "sign language" can include unique signs representing specific gang affiliations, as well as other, more general gang-related signs and gestures that may be common among various street gangs. The use of complex, secretive forms of communication is a common feature of criminal organizations, as it can make it more difficult for law enforcement and outsiders to intercept and interpret the group's activities.

However, it is also important to note that in recent years, MS-13 has started to depart from some of these traditional markers of gang identity, as law enforcement agencies have become more adept at identifying and targeting individuals based on these visible signs of gang affiliation. As a result, some MS-13 members may now forego tattoos or use more discreet tattoo placements, while also adopting a more varied and subtle range of signs and gestures to communicate their affiliation and intentions. This evolution underscores the adaptive and resilient nature of the gang, as it seeks to evade detection and continue its criminal operations both in the United States and abroad.

In summary, while the statement about tattoos and sign language is a reasonable representation of some key aspects of MS-13's identity and distinguishing features, it does not fully capture the complexity and evolving nature of the gang. MS-13 is a transnational criminal organization with roots in El Salvador that began in Los Angeles, and over time, has spread across the United States and Central America. Understanding the gang's origins, history, and present-day activities is crucial to formulate effective strategies to address and mitigate the threat it poses to society.
