The Patimokkha, a foundational aspect of the Vinaya, refers to the collection of rules and regulations guiding the monastic conduct within the Theravada Buddhist tradition. As a moral code specifically designed for monks and nuns, the Patimokkha plays a crucial role in shaping the monastic life and maintaining community harmony. The term "Patimokkha" can be broken down into two components: "Pati" meaning "toward" and "Mokkha" meaning "liberation." This conveys that the rules are intended to guide the monastic community towards spiritual liberation.

Comprising 227 rules for monks (Bhikkhus) and 311 rules for nuns (Bhikkhunis), the Patimokkha serves as a code of conduct that provides a practical framework for monastic discipline. These rules focus on promoting a lifestyle that fosters mindfulness, simplicity, and meditation, thereby enabling monks and nuns to stay on the path to enlightenment while living harmoniously within the monastic community.

The Patimokkha rules can be divided into eight categories, based on the severity of the transgression and the corresponding penalties. The categories are:

1. Parajika: Rules that entail expulsion from the monastic community. There are four Parajika rules for monks and eight for nuns. Violation of these rules leads to immediate expulsion from the monastic order.

2. Sanghadisesa: Rules that call for disciplinary proceedings within the community. There are thirteen Sanghadisesa rules for monks and seventeen for nuns. Offenders must undergo penance and rehabilitation under the supervision of the monastic community.

3. Aniyata: Rules with undetermined penalties that require the offender to undergo a formal inquiry by the community. There are two Aniyata rules for monks and nuns.

4. Nissaggiya Pacittiya: Rules involving offenses that require the relinquishment of any gains made from the offense and confession. There are thirty Nissaggiya Pacittiya rules for monks and thirty-two for nuns.

5. Pacittiya: Rules that necessitate self-confession and acknowledgment of the offense in front of a fellow monastic. There are ninety-two Pacittiya rules for monks and one hundred and sixty-six for nuns.

6. Patidesaniya: Rules requiring an acknowledgment of wrongdoing but not a formal confession. There are four Patidesaniya rules for monks and eight for nuns.

7. Sekhiya: Rules of training that provide guidance on appropriate monastic behavior and etiquette. There are seventy-five Sekhiya rules for both monks and nuns.

8. Adhikarana-samatha: Rules governing the resolution of conflicts within the monastic community. There are seven Adhikarana-samatha rules for both monks and nuns.

In addition to the Patimokkha, the Vinaya also includes regulations for novice monks (Samaneras) who adhere to the ten precepts, which serve as basic guidelines for monastic life. These precepts, a more simplified and less stringent code of conduct, aid in laying the foundation for future adoption of the complete Patimokkha rules when the novice monk is ready to advance within the monastic order.

While the Patimokkha serves as a significant source of monastic discipline across the Theravada tradition, the precise content of the Vinaya Pitaka varies slightly among the different schools and subschools of Buddhism. This variation may lead to divergent interpretations and approaches to the adherence of the Vinaya.

Despite these variations, the Patimokkha remains a vital component of the monastic discipline across the Buddhist tradition. By providing monks and nuns with a structured moral code, the Patimokkha equips them with the necessary guidance and a conducive environment for deepening their spiritual practice and working towards the ultimate goal of attaining enlightenment.
