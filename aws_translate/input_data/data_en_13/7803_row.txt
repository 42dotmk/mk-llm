force exerted by the arrow upon impact was greater than the structural integrity of the board, causing it to fracture and ultimately break apart. The factors that contributed to the board's breaking can be examined from various perspectives, such as the materials used, the design of the arrow, and the kinetic energy involved in the process. 

First, let's focus on the board's material properties. The board would have been made from a specific type of material, such as wood, plastic, or composite. Each of these materials has a different strength, stiffness, and density, which will all affect how it responds to an external force. For example, wood is a natural material that has a relatively low density compared to plastics and composites, but it is also quite strong and durable. However, if a board made of wood contains knots, imperfections, or areas of low-quality grain orientation, its overall structural strength will be reduced, making it more susceptible to breaking when subjected to a force such as that imparted by the arrow.

Secondly, the design of the arrow plays a crucial role in determining the force it can exert upon impact. Arrows can be made of various materials such as wood, aluminum, carbon fiber, or a combination of different materials. The weight, stiffness, and aerodynamics of the arrow will all affect its performance in flight and during impact. If the arrow used in the present case shot with sufficient velocity and precision, it could generate enough concentrated force at the point of impact to ultimately break the board in half. This is especially true if the arrow was equipped with a broadhead, which is designed to create more significant damage upon impact, rather than a traditional field point that would typically be used for target practice.

Now let's delve into the kinetic energy and the physics involved in the process. The kinetic energy of an object in motion (such as the arrow in flight) can be defined by the equation KE = 0.5mv^2, where KE represents the kinetic energy, m is the object's mass, and v is the object's velocity. The higher an object's mass and velocity, the greater its kinetic energy will be. When the arrow makes contact with the board, this kinetic energy is transferred to the board. As a result, the board experiences a force that acts on a very localized area (assuming the arrowhead to be relatively small), which may exceed the stress-bearing capacity of that area. From the physics standpoint, the force applied to the board can be described by the equation F = ma, where F is the force, m is the object's mass, and a is the object's acceleration. As the arrow's mass and acceleration increase, the force exerted on the board also increases.

Finally, it is essential to consider the cumulative effect of all these factors. The board's material properties and any inherent weaknesses, the design and characteristics of the arrow, and the kinetic energy generated during the arrow's flight all contribute to the force experienced by the board when struck. If this force is greater than the board's ability to withstand such stress, the board will ultimately break apart, as evidenced by the given scenario.

In conclusion, the board broke in half when shot by the arrow due to a combination of factors that led to an overwhelming force being exerted on the board, surpassing its structural integrity and causing it to fracture. By examining the materials, the arrow's design, and the physics involved, it becomes clear that multiple elements contributed to this outcome. Therefore, improving any one of these aspects may help prevent similar incidents in the future, either by increasing the structural strength of the board or by reducing the force with which the arrow impacts it.
