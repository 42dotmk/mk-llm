Summarize the following:
The two beefsteak tomatoes need to be roasted for 20 to 25 minutes in an oven heated to 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius). Once cooled, the skin should be peeled off.  The tomatoes should weigh about 1 lb (450 g) combined. Preheat an oven or toaster oven to 500 degrees degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius). Prepare a rimmed baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil. As the oven heats, prepare the tomatoes by cutting an "x" through the skin at the bottom of each one. This incision will make it easier to peel away the skin later on. Place the tomatoes on the baking sheet, and place the baking sheet in the preheated oven. Roast the tomatoes until they are well-charred and tender. This should take about 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool. The skin should already be peeling away at the "x" incision you made earlier. Once the tomatoes are cool to the touch, pull off the skin by peeling it away at the "x" mark. Throw the skin out. The chiles should be seeded and toasted in a large skillet over medium-low heat until fragrant.  The chiles should be about 5 to 6 inches (13 to 15 cm) each. Wipe them clean with a moist paper towel before proceeding. Use a sharp kitchen knife or a pair of kitchen scissors to cut the chiles open lengthwise, from end to end. Dig out the seeds and any large ribs. Heat a heavy skillet or griddle over medium-low heat without oil. Place the chiles on the skillet cut-side-down. Press them down and flip them over with a heat-resistant spatula until they become just barely darkened and fragrant. This should take about 1 minute per chile, and you should work in batches of 1 or 2 chiles at a time. Cover the toasted chiles with cold water and let them soak for about 30 minutes.  Use a medium-size bowl. The chiles should soak until they are softened. Add the garlic and onion to the heated skillet or griddle in batches. Toast each one until they are golden-brown with a few blackened spots.  You need about 1/4 cup (60 ml) of peeled garlic. You can add up to twice as much if you prefer a stronger garlic taste. Turn the garlic as necessary to prevent it from blackening too much. The garlic will need to be cooked for about 8 minutes. Only flip the onion slices once. The onion needs to be cooked for roughly 15 minutes. Blend together the drained chiles, tomatoes, garlic, onion, cloves, and allspice with a little water.  After the chiles have finished soaking, drain them and place them into your blender. Add the tomatoes to the blender along with any tomato juice they are sitting in. Add the garlic, onion, cloves, and allspice, as well. Puree the sauce. Add up to 1/2 cup (125 ml) water, pouring in a little at a time, until the sauce becomes very smooth. This should take around 2 minutes. Heat the oil in a large stockpot before adding the puree. Fry the puree until it becomes thicker.  Heat the vegetable oil in a 6-qt (6-l) heavy-duty stockpot over medium heat. A Dutch oven also works well. Add the puree. It will likely splatter, so prepare yourself. Reduce the heat to low. Fry the puree, stirring constantly with a wooden spatula or spoon, until it thickens. This should take about 5 minutes. Add 1 cup (250 ml) water, as well as the vinegar, sugar, and salt.  After adding the water, raise the heat to medium-high and bring the sauce to a boil. Add the vinegar, sugar, and salt. You will need about 1 Tbsp (15 ml) salt, but you can add more or less depending on your own sense of taste. Reduce the heat again to medium or medium-low, so that the sauce sits at a steady simmer. Partially cover the pot, leaving a small gap to vent some of the steam. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Add water, if necessary, to keep the sauce at the same consistency.
