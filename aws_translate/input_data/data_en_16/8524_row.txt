Johan Santana, who didn't pitch in 2013 after having shoulder surgery in April, is among the interesting free-agent names this offseason. Declining the $25 million option on Santana, maybe the New York Mets are hoping to sign the two-time Cy Young winner to a low-risk deal?

Meanwhile, there's some major All-Star talent on the market who would make an immediate impact with whichever team signs them. Click through this photo gallery for this offseason's top free agents.

The nine-year veteran is the top-shelf item on the free-agent market. Cano is working with Jay-Z's Roc Nation Sports agency, and reports have surfaced the five-time All-Star is seeking a deal in the $300 million range. It's hard to imagine Cano not in Yankees pinstripes, but it's a possibility.

AGE: 31 (Oct. 22, 1982) 2013 STATISTICS .314, 27 HR, 107 RBI, 81 R, 160 G CAREER (2005 debut) .309, 204 HR, 822 RBI, 799 R, 1,649 H

Winning his second World Series ring this fall, Ellsbury played a huge role in Boston's playoff run. He hit .500 (9 for 18) in the ALDS vs. Tampa Bay, and .318 (7 for 22) in the ALCS vs. Detroit. He led the postseason with 14 runs and six stolen bases. That's the same style of play the seven-year veteran brings to the ballpark everyday.

AGE: 30 (Sept. 11, 1983) 2013 STATISTICS .298, 9 HR, 53 RBI, 92 R, 52 SB CAREER (2007 debut) .297, 65 HR, 314 RBI, 476 R, 241 SB

Choo is a table-setter. In 2013, the center fielder ranked second in the NL in on-base percentage, runs and walks and led the majors with 26 hit by pitches. The nine-year veteran would be a huge plus at the top of any lineup, but he won't come cheap.

AGE: 31 (July 13, 1982) 2013 STATISTICS .285, 21 HR, 54 RBI, 107 R, 112 BB CAREER (2005 debut) .288, 104 HR, 427 RBI, 497 R, .389, OBP

The Duluth, Ga., native played through a shoulder injury and missed part of this past season, but he still produced his sixth consecutive 20-homer season — and seventh in eight years. McCann is a seven-time All-Star and a five-time Silver Slugger winner.

AGE: 29 (Feb. 20, 1984) 2013 STATISTICS .256, 20 HR, 57 RBI, 43 R, 102 G CAREER (2005 debut) .277, 176 HR, 661 RBI, 464 R, 1,070 H

Granderson's 2013 campaign was hindered by injuries, limiting him to 61 games. He missed the first two months after breaking his forearm when hit by a pitch in the Yankees' first spring training game. Then in his eighth game back, he fractured his pinkie finger, returning to the DL until Aug. 2. When healthy, he's one of the top offensive center fielders in the game.

AGE: 32 (March 16, 1981) 2013 STATISTICS .229, 7 HR, 15 RBI, 31 R, 8 SB, 61 G CAREER (2004 debut) .261, 217 HR, 606 RBI, 780 R, 122 SB, 1,157 H

In his 16th season, Beltran finally made it to the World Series, though it ended in a six-game loss to the Red Sox. Beltran was a huge plus to the Cards his two years in St. Louis, but with his turning 37 in April and demanding more money than an average veteran slugger, it's unlikely he'll return. Expect Beltran to sign with an AL club where he can split time between the outfield and DH.

AGE: 36 (April 24, 1977) 2013 STATISTICS .296, 24 HR, 84 RBI, 79 R, 145 G CAREER (1998 debut) .283, 358 HR, 1,327 RBI, 1,346 R, 2,228 H

Cruz was suspended 50 games in the second half of the season by Major League Baseball for performance-enhancing drugs. When he was out, it was obvious how much the Texas Rangers missed the slugger in their lineup. Reports claim keeping him is high on the club's priority list.

AGE: 33 (July 1, 1980) 2013 STATISTICS .266, 27 HR, 76 RBI, 49 R, 109 G CAREER (2005 debut) .268, 157 HR, 489 RBI, 404 R, 774 H

Like Texas' Nelson Cruz, Peralta also was suspended 50 games for performance-enhancing drugs in the second half of the season. It's unlikely Peralta will stay with the Tigers since they traded for shortstop Jose Iglesias after the ban was announced.

AGE: 31 (May 28, 1982) 2013 STATISTICS .303, 11 HR, 55 RBI, 50 R, 107 G CAREER (2003 debut) .268, 156 HR, 698 RBI, 676 R, 1,369 H

Napoli has been to the playoffs six times in his eight-year career, finally winning a World Series with the Red Sox this October. Like Atlanta's Brian McCann, Napoli just posted his sixth consecutive 20-homer season. After primarily playing catcher the previous seven seasons, Napoli didn't catch one game this year, handling first-base duties in 131 games.

AGE: 32 (Oct. 31, 1981) 2013 STATISTICS .259, 23 HR, 92 RBI, 79 R CAREER (2006 debut) .259, 169 HR, 472 RBI, 450 R, 716 H

Jimenez helped his market value with an impressive second half of the season. Despite only going 6-5 since the All-Star break, the right-hander really turned it up a notch, leading the AL with a 1.82 ERA in that span. In September, he went 4-0 with a 1.09 ERA in six starts, helping Cleveland rally for an AL wild-card berth.

AGE: 29 (Jan. 22, 1984) 2013 STATISTICS 13-9, 3.30 ERA, 194 K, 80 BB, 182.2 IP, 1.33 WHIP CAREER (2006 debut) 82-75, 3.92 ERA, 1,172 K, 1.35 WHIP

In his first season with the Royals, the right-hander finished the 2013 campaign with the lowest ERA in his nine-year career — pitching the first eight with the LA Angels. If Santana can remove the 'inconsistent' label from his name, he could be one of the top pitchers in the league.

AGE: 30 (Dec. 12, 1982) 2013 STATISTICS 9-10, 3.24 ERA, 161 K, 51 BB, 211 IP, 1.14 WHIP CAREER (2005 debut) 105-90, 4.19 ERA, 1,328 K, 1.28 WHIP

A trade-deadline acquistion from the Cubs, Garza didn't really pitch that well for the Rangers down the stretch. He went 4-5 with a 4.38 ERA in 13 starts — he was 6-1 with a 3.17 ERA in 11 starts for the Cubs. Garza did miss the first month and a half as he was recovering from an elbow injury sustained in July, 2012, and a lat injury suffered this spring training.

AGE: 29 (Nov. 26, 1983) 2013 STATISTICS 10-6, 3.82 ERA, 136 K, 42 BB, 155.1 IP, 1.24 WHIP CAREER (2006 debut) 67-67, 3.84 ERA, 1,001 K, 1.28 WHIP

The right-hander completed his second season as the Rays closer, saving 85 games in 95 opportunities — he only blew two saves in 2012. Rodney held opposing hitters to a .211 batting average this year, a drop-off from the .167 mark the previous season. Is Tampa Bay willing to part ways with their arrow-shooting door-slammer?

AGE: 36 (March 18, 1977) 2013 STATISTICS 37 Sv, 8 BSv, 5-4, 3.38 ERA, 82 K, 66.2 IP, 1.34 WHIP CAREER (2002 debut) 172 Sv, 29-44, 3.70 ERA, 551 K, 1.36 WHIP

Nathan, who is seeking a two-year deal, became a free agent after declining Texas' $9 million option. The right-hander made the All-Star team the past two years as the Rangers' closer. He held opponents to a .162 batting average in 2013.

AGE: 38 (Nov. 22, 1974) 2013 STATISTICS 43 Sv, 3 BSv, 6-2, 1.39 ERA, 73 K, 64.2 IP, 0.90 WHIP CAREER (1999 debut) 341 Sv, 57-30, 2.76 ERA, 912 K, 1.09 WHIP

Oakland isn't known for spending money on relievers, so it's unlikely the Australian-born Balfour will remain with the A's. The right-hander, who took over the closing duties in 2012, held opponents to a .206 batting average this season, following an impressive .160 average a year earlier.

AGE: 35 (Dec. 30, 1977) 2013 STATISTICS 38 Sv, 3 BSv, 1-3, 2.59 ERA, 72 K, 62.2 IP, 1.20 WHIP CAREER (2001 debut) 72 Sv, 28-17, 3.27 ERA, 514 K, 1.19 WHIP

The right-hander posted impressive numbers in 2013 and was one of six NL pitchers with 200-plus strikeouts. Burnett has already said he wants to retire as a Pittsburgh Pirate, so he might consider retirement if a deal can't be worked out.

AGE: 36 (Jan. 3, 1977) 2013 STATISTICS 10-11, 3.30 ERA, 209 K, 67 BB, 191 IP, 1.22 WHIP CAREER (1999 debut) 147-132, 3.99 ERA, 2,180 K, 1.32 WHIP

With Kuroda having signed one-year contracts the last two years with the Yankees, GM Brian Cashman is afraid the right-hander will return to Japan. There is the thought Kuroda wants to finish his baseball career in his native country, but he denied that theory in an August interview with the New York Post.

AGE: 38 (Feb. 10, 1975) 2013 STATISTICS 11-13, 3.31 ERA, 150 K, 43 BB, 201.1 IP, 1.16 WHIP CAREER (2008 debut) 68-70, 3.40 ERA, 840 K, 1.18 WHIP

Even though the right-hander started his career with Oakland, it's hard to imagine Hudson in any other uniform besides the Atlanta Braves. His 2013 season was cut short when he broke his ankle covering first base in a July game. While the Braves have expressed the hope to re-sign the three-time All-Star, reports are the Yankees are interested.

AGE: 38 (July 14, 1975) 2013 STATISTICS 8-7, 3.97 ERA, 95 K, 36 BB, 131.1 IP, 1.19 WHIP CAREER (1999 debut) 205-111, 3.44 ERA, 1,896 K, 1.23 WHIP

Having shoulder surgery in May, it was a forgettable season for the two-time Cy Young winner. But the right-hander showed promise in September, going 1-1 with a 3.78 ERA in four starts — and the Phillies would like to keep him. The question is: How much is a team willing to spend on the 16-year veteran?

AGE: 36 (May 14, 1977) 2013 STATISTICS 4-5, 6.82 ERA, 51 K, 36 BB, 62 IP, 1.47 WHIP CAREER (1998 debut) 203-105, 3.38 ERA, 2,117 K, 1.18 WHIP
