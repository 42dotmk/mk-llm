ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- A domestic dispute aboard a cruise ship led to the death of a 39-year-old Utah woman, and the FBI is investigating what happened in U.S. waters off Alaska, the agency said Wednesday. 
  
 Princess Cruises said the woman died Tuesday night on the Emerald Princess, which was carrying 3,400 passengers and 1,100 crew members on a weeklong trip that left Sunday from Seattle. Company spokeswoman Negin Kamali declined to provide any other details about the case, referring questions to the FBI. 
  
 "Since the incident, our fleet security team has been coordinating with the FBI and other local authorities," Princess Cruises said in a statement to CBS affiliate KTVA in Anchorage. 
  
 FBI spokeswoman Staci Feger-Pellessier said no arrests had yet been made, but a team was heading to Alaska's capital city of Juneau.

 The ship was diverted to Juneau because of the investigation, arriving nearly five hours ahead of schedule on Wednesday morning, said S. Kirby Day III with the cruise line. Passengers, however, were not immediately allowed to get off the ship, he said. 
  
 Passengers were seen taking photos of Gastineau Channel and Juneau from the decks and balconies of the ship. 
  
 No further schedule changes were expected for the cruise, which was set to leave late Wednesday and head to the southeast Alaska town of Skagway, Kamali said. 
  
 But conversations are underway to offer passengers some compensation for lost time, such as providing credits for shore excursions, she said. 
  
 Since the vessel arrived so early, excursions such as glacier viewing or seeing sled dogs were not ready, but Day anticipated allowing people off the ship later in the day. 
  
 The FBI said it is required to step in when such deaths occur in international or U.S. waters. ||||| FBI agents responded from the bureau’s Anchorage office to investigate the suspicious death of a 39-year-old woman from Utah who was aboard a cruise ship off Southeast Alaska. 
  
 Anchorage FBI spokeswoman Staci Feger-Pellessier said the death, aboard the Emerald Princess near Juneau, was reported to the FBI Wednesday morning. 
  
 “It was in water outside of any state’s territory,�? Feger-Pellessier said. “That’s why it’s our jurisdiction.�? 
  
 Charles Rowlen tells KTVA he and his wife were in a room, two floors above, where the incident took place Tuesday night. 
  
 “It was evening for us, I had turned in and my wife was taking a shower and I heard terrible screaming, I mean you knew it wasn’t normal,” Charles said. “And it sounded like two or three ladies or girls, definitely women screaming.” 
  
 Rowlen said his wife looked over the balcony and saw a man, bruised, cut and covered in blood. 
  
 “My wife’s a registered nurse, she thought he was going to jump over the rail, and at one point he put his hand on the rail and set his rear on it, but she started yelling get back in and the ship announced, get a security team to that area,” he said. 
  
 Rowlen said the yelling got worse. 
  
 “There was a lot of yelling started up again between men, fighting you know, somebody hurt somebody’s sister and it was a family dispute,” he said. “At one time, when my wife went to the phone, I yelled down to the young man, I said, ‘don’t worry, there’s help coming, you’ll be okay and we’re praying for ya.'” 
  
 At the time, Rowlen says he couldn’t see that a woman lay dead on the deck below. 
  
 Chris Ceman was in a room just down the hall. 
  
 “One of the little girls from that room came running out, calling for help, that her parents were in a fight,” Ceman said. “She sounded pretty desperate.” 
  
 Like most of the other passengers, he didn’t learn of the death until the morning. Both Rowlen and Ceman say they didn’t hear gunshots. 
  
 The crime scene aboard the cruise ship had been secured by late Wednesday morning, Feger-Pellessier said, and the FBI sent an evidence response team from Anchorage to Juneau. The identity of the victim, as well as any word on the status of any suspects, wasn’t immediately available. 
  
 In a statement, Princess Cruises said that a domestic dispute occurred aboard the Emerald Princess at about 9 p.m. Tuesday “resulting in the death of a 39-year-old female guest from Utah.�? 
  
 “Since the incident, our fleet security team has been coordinating with the FBI and other local authorities,�? Princess officials wrote. 
  
 By late Wednesday morning, the cruise ship was tied up alongside a Juneau dock. None of the passengers were allowed to debark, however. 
  
 Kirby Day, a Princess Cruises employee in Juneau, said the Emerald Princess had been scheduled to arrive in Juneau at 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, but its arrival was expedited to 8 a.m. due to the death on board. 
  
 Day said passengers would hopefully be released by 2 p.m. to join pre-scheduled tours. However, around 3 o’clock, the Emerald Princess Captain said all Juneau tours have been canceled for passengers on board. 
  
 The nearly 5,000 passengers were stuck on board until around 5 p.m. Some say they were frustrated they had missed out on pre-paid excursions in Juneau. But, many others told KTVA the mood on board was somber and people remained calm, despite the wait 
  
 The Emerald Princess, on a one-week cruise out of Seattle since July 23, had been scheduled to make a scenic cruise of Tracy Arm Fjord on Wednesday. Princess officials said that excursion had been canceled. 
  
 The ship set sail for Skagway at 11:15 p.m. 
  
 The FBI has confirmed a suspect in the killing is in custody. A press conference is scheduled for Thursday morning.

 ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A suspect is in custody in the death of a woman during a domestic dispute on a cruise ship in U.S. waters off Alaska, the FBI in Anchorage said late Wednesday. 
  
 FBI spokeswoman Staci Feger-Pellessier had no other details ahead of a scheduled Thursday news conference at which the U.S. attorney's office plans to announce charges. 
  
 Princess Cruises said the 39-year-old woman died Tuesday night on the Emerald Princess, which was carrying 3,400 passengers and 1,100 crew members on a weeklong trip that left Sunday from Seattle. 
  
 Company spokeswoman Negin Kamali declined to provide any other details, including the woman's name, and referred questions to the FBI. 
  
 The Emerald Princess was diverted to Juneau because of the investigation, which the Coast Guard was also involved in. The ship arrived in Juneau early Wednesday, and passengers were stuck on board for more than eight hours before they were allowed to disembark. While on board, some scoped out their surroundings with binoculars or took pictures, while others watched the comings-and-goings in the restricted-access area leading to the ship. Some waved to onlookers on shore. 
  
 The scene was a bit harried as people got off the boat, trying to figure out if their shore excursion was still on or making alternate sight-seeing plans. 
  
 Suzanne Ragsdale, of Houston, said passengers were notified late Tuesday about security issues and told over the public address system Wednesday morning that there had been a death. She said being onboard for so long was "awful" and that her kids were bored. 
  
 Her family had hoped to see Mendenhall Glacier, a popular local destination, and to do some whale watching. She said she was able to rebook a whale watching cruise for Wednesday evening. 
  
 "I was hoping we'd be cruise people. We may not be after this," she said. 
  
 Zane Edwards, who was traveling with his family, said efforts were made to take care of passengers. There were games in the main atrium and movies playing in theaters, he said. 
  
 Edwards, of California, said this is his first trip to Alaska, though he's been on other cruises. "It's like a mini city. Things are going to happen," he said. 
  
 Earlier, several people, including at least one child, were escorted by authorities off the vessel in separate groups. Some were wearing white and gray hooded sweat shirts, with hoods or umbrellas in some cases obscuring their faces. 
  
 The groups were whisked away in vehicles with dark-tinted windows that waited in a restricted area of the port. 
  
 No further schedule changes were expected for the cruise, which was set to leave late Wednesday and head to the southeast Alaska town of Skagway. 
  
 Conversations were underway to offer passengers compensation for lost time, such as providing credits for shore excursions, Kamali said. 
  
 The FBI said it is required to step in when such deaths occur in international or U.S. waters.
