Question: Ms. Hatcher teaches 20 third-graders and a number of fourth-graders that is twice the number of third-graders. Her co-teacher asked her to substitute for her fifth-grade class that has half as many students as the number of third-graders. How many students did Ms. Hatcher teach for the day?
Answer: Ms. Hatcher taught 20 x 2 = 40 fourth graders for the day. She taught 20 / 2 = 10 fifth - graders as a substitute teacher for the day. Therefore, she taught 20 + 40 + 10 = 70 students for the day. The answer is 70.

Q: Jean is wanted on 3 counts of arson, 2 burglary charges, and six times as many petty larceny as burglary charges. If each arson count has a 36-month sentence, each burglary charge is 18 months and each petty larceny charge is 1/3rd as long as a burglary charge, how many months in jail is Jean facing?
A: First find the total time for the burglary charges: 18 months / charge * 2 charges = 36 months. Then find the total time for the arson charges: 3 counts * 36 months / count = 108 months. Then find the time per larceny charge: 18 months / 3 = 6 months. Then find the total number of larceny charges: 2 charges * 6 = 12 charges. Then find the total time for the larceny charges: 6 months / charge * 12 charges = 72 months. Then add up the time for all the charges to find the total jail time: 36 months + 72 months + 108 months = 216 months. The answer is 216.
Question: Henry believes in the famous phrase, "An apple a day, keeps the doctor away." If a box contains 14 apples, how many weeks can Henry and his brother spend eating 3 boxes of apples if they each eat 1 apple a day?
Answer: There are a total of 14 apples / box x 3 boxes = 42 apples in the 3 boxes. So, Henry and his brother each have 42 apples / 2 people = 21 apples / person to consume. Since there are 7 days in a week, thus, both of them can consume the 3 boxes of apples in 21 / 7 = 3 weeks. The answer is 3.
[Question]Jordan is a hockey goalie. In the first period of a game, he blocked four shots. In the second period, he blocked twice as many shots. In the third period, he blocked three fewer than in the second period. When the game ended after the fourth period, he had blocked 21 shots in all. How many did Jordan block in the fourth period?
[Answer]Let F be the number of shots Jordan blocked in the fourth period. In the second period, he blocked 2 * 4 = 8 shots. In the third period, he blocked 8 - 3 = 5 shots. In the whole game, he blocked 4 + 8 + 5 + F = 17 + F = 21 shots. Thus, Jordan blocked F = 21 - 17 = 4 shots in the fourth period. The answer is 4.
