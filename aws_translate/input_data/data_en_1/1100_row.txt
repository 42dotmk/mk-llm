Q: John is half times younger than his father, who is 4 years older than John's mother. If John's father is 40 years old, what's the age difference between John and his mother?
A: John is half times his father's age. Thus 1 / 2 * 40 = 20 years. Since the mother is 4 years younger than the father, she is 40 - 4 = 36 years old. The age difference between John and his mother is 36 - 20 = 16 years. The answer is 16.
Question: Ms. Warren ran at 6 mph for 20 minutes. After the run, she walked at 2 mph for 30 minutes. How many miles did she run and walk in total?
Answer: 20 minutes is 20 / 60 = 1 / 3 of an hour. Ms. Warren ran 6 / 3 = 2 miles. 30 minutes is 30 / 60 = 1 / 2 of an hour. Ms. Warren walked 2 / 2 = 1 mile. Ms Warren ran and walked 2 + 1 = 3 miles in total. The answer is 3.
[Question]What is the average age of the 1st and 5th fastest dogs if the 1st fastest dog is 10 years old, the 2nd fastest dog is 2 years younger than the first fastest dog, the 3rd fastest dog is 4 years older than the 2nd fastest dog, the 4th fastest dog is half the age of the 3rd fastest dog, and the 5th fastest dog is 20 years older than the 4th fastest dog?
[Answer]If the 1st fastest dog is 10 years old, and the 2nd fastest dog is 2 years younger than the first fastest dog, the 2nd fastest dog is 10 - 2 = 8 years old. The 3rd fastest dog being 4 years older than the 2nd fastest dog, is 8 + 4 = 12 years old. The 4th fastest dog is half the age of the 3rd fastest dog, meaning the 4th fastest dog is 1 / 2 * 12 = 6 years old. The 5th fastest dog is 20 years older than the 4th fastest dog, meaning the 5th fastest dog is 6 + 20 = 26 years old. The total age of the 1st and 5th fastest dogs is 26 + 10 = 36 years. The average age of the 1st and 5th fastest dogs is 36 / 2 = 18 years old. The answer is 18.
Q: Megan’s grandma gave her $125 to start a savings account. She was able to increase the account by 25% from funds she earned babysitting. Then it decreased by 20% when she bought a new pair of shoes. Her final balance is what percentage of her starting balance?
A: Megan started with $125 and increased it by 25%, so $125 + (0.25)125 or $125 + $31.25 = $156.25. Then the balance decreased by 20%, so $156.25 – (0.20)156.25 or $156.25 - $31.25 = $125. $125 is the balance Megan started with, so her final balance is 100% of the starting balance. The answer is 100.
Question: On a tough week, Haji's mother sells goods worth $800, which is half the amount she sells on a good week. What's the total amount of money she makes if she has 5 good weeks and 3 tough weeks?
Answer: If on a tough week she sells half what she sells on a good week, then on a good week she sells 800 * 2 = 1600 dollars. If she had 5 good weeks, the amount is 5 * 1600 = 8000 dollars. During the 3 tough weeks, she sells 3 * 800 = 2400 dollars. The total amount she sold in both weeks is 2400 + 8000 = 10400 dollars. The answer is 10400.
