Before attending their friend's wedding and enjoying the event, Aubrey would need to take care of several preliminary tasks. It is crucial to ensure proper preparations are made ahead of time to have an enjoyable, memorable experience. Some of these tasks include the following:

1. Receive an invitation: Aubrey needs to be invited to the event in the first place (as suggested in option II). Receiving a wedding invitation is essential to confirm their attendance, as it is a formal occasion. An invitation typically includes essential information such as the date, time, venue, dress code, and RSVP details.

2. RSVP: Upon receiving the wedding invitation, Aubrey should send an RSVP to the couple. This step helps the hosts in arranging suitable seating, catering, and other arrangements for the guests.

3. Choose an outfit: Aubrey must select appropriate attire that matches the wedding's dress code, style, and theme. It is crucial to adhere to the dress code to show respect and avoid unintentionally upstaging the bride and groom.

4. Arrange transportation and accommodation: Depending on the wedding location, Aubrey might need to plan their transportation to the venue. This step involves booking a flight, reserving a rental car, or exploring public transportation options. If the wedding is an out-of-town event, booking accommodation near the wedding venue would also be necessary.

5. Purchase a wedding gift: Selecting and purchasing a suitable wedding gift for the bride and groom can be a challenging task. It is essential to choose a thoughtful present that holds sentimental value or is useful to the couple. Aubrey could also consider contributing to the couple's registry if they have one.

6. Prepare for the ceremony and reception: As a guest, Aubrey must be aware of the event schedule and timings. This step involves knowing when to arrive at the ceremony, finding a seat in the designated guest area, and being acquainted with any unique traditions, customs, or rituals to be conducted during the wedding.

7. Participate in pre-wedding events: Often, the bride, groom, or close family members organize pre-wedding events such as rehearsal dinners, bachelor/bachelorette parties, or bridal showers. If Aubrey is invited to any of these events, they should be prepared to attend and actively participate.

Note that option I (have their first dance as husband and wife) is not applicable in this scenario, as Aubrey is attending the wedding as a friend and not as part of the couple getting married. The first dance is usually reserved for the bride and groom. Option III (go somewhere else) might apply if the wedding festivities encompass multiple venues or require attending other events before the actual wedding day.

In conclusion, attending a friend's wedding as a guest involves several essential steps, such as receiving an invitation, sending an RSVP, choosing an outfit, arranging transportation and accommodation, purchasing a wedding gift, and preparing for the wedding ceremony and other related events. By diligently executing these tasks, Aubrey can ensure a smooth, enjoyable experience at the wedding and create lasting memories.
