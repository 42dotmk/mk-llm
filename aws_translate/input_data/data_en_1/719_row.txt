Step 1: Establish the setting and main characters.

To build a movie plot, we first need to establish the setting and the main characters. Let's choose a remote mountainous area as the setting where cell phone signals are weak or non-existent. The main characters of the story will be a group of five friends: Jake, Sarah, Mike, Olivia, and Lily.

Step 2: Introduce the backstory and motivation for the journey.

Jake, the adventurous one, is motivated to go on a hiking and camping trip to the remote mountains after hearing about a hidden treasure that lies deep in the wilderness, which is rumored to be guarded by an ancient tribe. With the promise of excitement and discovery, he convinces Sarah, an aspiring photographer, Mike, a history enthusiast, Olivia, a nature lover, and Lily, who is primarily there to bond with her friends, to join him on this quest.

Step 3: Create the main conflict that prevents the friends from calling for help.

Upon reaching the mountains, the group discovers an ancient ruin, which might provide a clue to the treasure's location. However, during their exploration, they accidentally set off a booby trap, causing the entrance to collapse and trap them inside. With no cell phone signal, they must rely on their wits and work together to find another way out or think of another solution like a flare gun, but they don't have it with them or they used it, but nobody noticed.

Step 4: Develop sub-plots for character development, tension, and challenges.

As the friends navigate through the underground ruins, each character faces personal struggles and growth:

- Jake questions his leadership abilities and feels guilty for leading his friends into this dangerous situation.
- Sarah, who is scared of confined spaces, must confront her fears to capture essential clues in photographs and decipher their meanings.
- Mike, whose vast historical knowledge becomes vital, must learn to communicate more effectively with the group.
- Olivia, tasked with finding ways to utilize their limited resources, overcomes self-doubt in her survival skills.
- Lily, initially seen as the weakest link, discovers her talents in problem-solving and keeps the group's spirits high.

Step 5: Reach the climax and resolution.

When the friends finally discover the hidden exit, they encounter the ancient tribe guarding the treasure. Mike, through effective communication, manages to convince the tribe that they only want to leave and have no intention of taking the treasure.

The tribe allows the friends to leave, but not before bestowing upon them a small, symbolic item representing the lessons they've learned during their journey. Upon returning to civilization, the friends are forever changed by their experiences but are grateful for the growth, bonds, and memories they have made together.

Overall, the movie plot revolves around the theme of friendship, personal growth, and learning how to rely on one another during challenging circumstances without the crutch of modern technology, also showcasing how they overcome the challenge of not being able to call for help due to a lack of cell phone signal.
