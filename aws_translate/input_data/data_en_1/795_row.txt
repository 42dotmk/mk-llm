The revolution, as described by Alexis de Tocqueville in the context of the French Revolution, was driven by a confluence of factors that ultimately stemmed from the growing tension and opposition between the monarchy and the men of letters of the Enlightenment. This tension can be analyzed through various dimensions, such as the rise of public opinion, the influence of the literary politics in promoting a discourse of equality, and the cultural transformations that occurred during this period.

First and foremost, the radical opposition between the monarchy and the men of letters of the Enlightenment was the result of the absolutist centralization of power, which effectively removed the nobility and bourgeoisie from the political sphere. Consequently, these men of letters, who constituted a "substitute aristocracy," found themselves in a paradoxical situation where they were both all-powerful and without real power. This perceived power stemmed primarily from the rise of public opinion, as their ideas and writings began to shape the mindset of the people and cast doubt on the legitimacy of the monarchical regime.

The influence of literary politics played a crucial role in driving the revolution as well. As intellectuals and philosophers disseminated their ideas on equality and human rights, they fostered a discourse that was fundamentally opposed to the monarchical system. Writers such as Voltaire, Rousseau, and Montesquieu questioned the foundations of the ancien régime and inspired new ideas about governance, social justice, and the role of the individual in society. This contestation of traditional values and norms created an environment of dissent and a desire for change, eventually culminating in a revolutionary movement.

In addition, the cultural effects of the transformation in the exercise of power significantly contributed to the unfolding of the revolution. The emergence of the public sphere, where people could openly discuss and debate ideas, provided a fertile ground for the spread of Enlightenment principles and ideologies. Literary and cultural productions, such as the Encyclopédie edited by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert, played a significant role in disseminating knowledge and challenging the accepted norms of the time. As historian Robert Darnton argued in his work "The Business of Enlightenment: A Publishing History of the Encyclopédie, 1775-1800" (1979), the cultural approach to the historiography of the French Revolution became increasingly central in understanding the underlying causes and motivations of this transformative period.

To conclude, the revolution, in the context of the French Revolution, was driven by the interplay between the radical opposition of the monarchy and the men of letters of the Enlightenment, the rise of public opinion, the influence of literary politics, and the cultural effects of the transformation in the forms of power. These factors converged to create a climate of discontent and an appetite for change, which ultimately led to the dismantling of the ancien régime and the birth of a new political and social order in France.
