In the 1920s, he was associated with the New Objectivity ("Neue Sachlichkeit"), an outgrowth of Expressionism that opposed its introverted emotionalism.  - Alexander Kanoldt ( 29 September 1881 -- 24 January 1939 ) was a German magic realist painter and one of the artists of the New Objectivity . Kanoldt was born in Karlsruhe . His father was the painter Edmond Kanoldt , a late practitioner of the Nazarene style .

He became a member of the Munich New Secession in 1913 , with Jawlensky and Paul Klee . After military service in World War I from 1914 to 1918 , the still lifes Kanoldt painted show the influence of Derain and an adaptation of cubist ideas . By the early 1920s Kanoldt developed the manner for which he is best known , a magic realist rendering of potted plants , angular tins , fruit and mugs on tabletops . He also painted portraits in the same severe style , as well as geometrical landscapes . In 1925 he was made a professor at Breslau Academy , a post he held until 1931 .
