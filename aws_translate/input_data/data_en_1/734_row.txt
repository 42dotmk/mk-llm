George Fox is associated with the founding of the Religious Society of Friends, more commonly known as the Quakers. This religious movement began in the mid-17th century in England and has since expanded to various parts across the globe, with followers today known as Friends or Quakers.

George Fox was born in 1624 in Leicestershire, England. Although he grew up in a traditionally religious family that adhered to the Church of England, Fox became disillusioned with the established religious institutions early in his life. He was concerned about the widespread social upheaval, violence, and hypocrisy present in his society, which led him to seek a more genuine and authentic way of connecting with God.

In 1647, Fox began to have a series of spiritual experiences and revelations that informed the basis of his new religious movement. He believed that all people had within them an inner light, which was a manifestation of God. This inner light, according to Fox, could guide individuals in their spiritual journeys and lead them to truth and righteousness, without the need for formal religious institutions or intermediaries such as priests. This belief in direct, unmediated communion with God was revolutionary at the time and laid the foundation for the Quakers' theology and practices.

In addition to their belief in the inner light, Quakers also emphasize the ideals of simplicity, pacifism, social justice, and equality. They reject traditional religious symbols, rituals, and hierarchy in favor of a more egalitarian approach that encourages members to find their spiritual paths and contribute in their unique ways. Quakers historically have been noted for their work in social and political causes, including the abolition of slavery, women's rights, prison reform, and peace advocacy.

Quaker meetings, or gatherings, are characterized by their simplicity and lack of liturgy. Friends come together in silence, without any minister or prescribed order of service, allowing the inner light to guide their thoughts and actions. When a member feels moved by the Spirit, they may stand up and share a message, known as ministry, with the rest of the congregation. This style of worship emphasizes the importance of personal experiences and communion with God over institutionalized religious practices.

In the years following George Fox's revelations, tens of thousands of people joined the Quaker movement, which spread from England to the rest of Europe, North America, and beyond. The movement faced significant opposition and persecution from both the state and established religious institutions, which saw the Quakers as a threat to their authority. Early Friends were often imprisoned, fined, or even executed for their beliefs and practices.

Today, the Religious Society of Friends has an estimated global membership of around 400,000, with different branches adhering to somewhat varying beliefs and practices. However, the core principles established by George Fox, including the belief in the inner light, simplicity, pacifism, social justice, and equality, continue to guide and distinguish the Quaker faith.
