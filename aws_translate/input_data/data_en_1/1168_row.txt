Chen Fangyun is a prominent Chinese scientist, engineer, and one of the pioneers in the Chinese satellite navigation system. With his remarkable vision, technical expertise, and leadership, Chen Fangyun played a crucial role in the conception and development of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), which has put China on the global stage in satellite navigation technology.

During the 1980s, China recognized the growing importance of satellite navigation technology for both military and civilian applications. Relying on foreign systems such as GPS (United States) or GLONASS (Russia) raised concerns about national security and technological independence. To address these concerns, Chen Fangyun and his colleagues, leveraging their extensive knowledge in satellite systems and related fields, proposed the development of a homegrown Chinese satellite navigation system.

Chen's plan was ambitious and consisted of a three-step development strategy to ensure the success of this monumental project. The China National Space Administration adopted this strategy, highlighting the importance of Chen Fangyun's contribution to the country's navigation satellite technology.

Step 1: Experimental Satellite System
In the first phase, a two-satellite experimental system was created, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of a comprehensive and operational satellite navigation system. By successfully launching two experimental satellites in 2000 and 2003, China demonstrated its capability to develop and deploy its own satellite navigation system.

Step 2: Regional Satellite Navigation System
The second phase focused on developing and deploying a regional satellite navigation system. This system would provide navigation, positioning, and timing services for the Chinese territory and the surrounding areas. Between 2009 and 2012, China successfully launched 10 more satellites, gradually extending the coverage of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System to the Asia-Pacific region.

Step 3: Global Satellite Navigation System
In the final phase, China aimed to expand the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System into a global network, offering seamless, worldwide navigation services. With the help of additional satellites, the system extended its coverage to other continents, ultimately resulting in a complete global constellation of BeiDou satellites. This ambitious goal was achieved in 2020, with the successful launch of the last BDS-3 satellite into orbit.

Chen Fangyun's foresight and dedication to the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System have been instrumental in its conception, development, and successful deployment. Under his guidance, China successfully transitioned from relying on foreign satellite navigation systems to becoming a major player in the field. Today, the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System is one of the four major satellite navigation systems globally, alongside GPS (United States), GLONASS (Russia), and Galileo (European Union). This achievement is a testament to Chen Fangyun's outstanding engineering and leadership skills and his unquestionable legacy in the field of satellite navigation technology.
