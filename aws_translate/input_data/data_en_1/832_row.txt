No, the provided answer does not directly address the question about the actions of the Union that damaged the southern cotton exports during the American Civil War. However, it does provide valuable context on the shifts in global trade dynamics after the Civil War that impacted the Egyptian cotton market and its relationship with the British and French markets. 

To answer the question more directly, it is important to consider the actions of the United States' Union during the American Civil War that damaged the southern cotton exports. These include:

1. Blockades: One significant action was the Union Navy's establishment of a naval blockade known as the "Anaconda Plan". This blockade aimed to restrict the Confederate States' access to the international cotton markets. Southern cotton producers relied heavily on exporting their cotton to foreign markets to sustain their economy. The blockade extended along the entire Southern coastline, severely disrupting cotton trade, and made it difficult for Southern producers to export their cotton, directly hurting the Confederate economy.

2. Destruction of Infrastructure: The Union forces engaged in a strategy of total war known as "scorched earth," which included destructive campaigns designed to cripple the South's ability to wage war and maintain its economy. Military campaigns led by Union generals, such as William Tecumseh Sherman's March to the Sea, contributed to the destruction of railroads, telegraph lines, and manufacturing centers that supported the production and transportation of cotton. This further damaged the southern cotton exports by limiting their ability to produce and transport cotton within the country and to their dwindling ports.

3. Occupation and Emancipation: Union forces gradually occupied key areas of the southern states, disrupting plantation operations and cotton production. The Emancipation Proclamation, signed in 1863, declared that all slaves in Confederate territory were to be set free, leading many slaves to flee the plantations or cease work, further reducing the southern labor force involved in cotton production.

4. International Diplomacy: The Union worked diligently to maintain diplomatic relations with Britain and France, discouraging them from officially recognizing the Confederacy or providing financial or direct military support. This was crucial in ensuring that the Confederacy struggled to maintain competitive access to the critical British and French markets for cotton, the prime export of the Southern states.

As a result of these Union strategies and actions, the Southern cotton exports faced significant damage. In conclusion, while the original provided answer gives an account of international market changes post-Civil War, it does not directly address the question that specifically asks about actions taken by the Union during the American Civil War that damaged the southern cotton exports. Instead, the actions outlined above—blockades, infrastructure destruction, occupation and emancipation, and international diplomacy—give the detailed and long answer necessary to address the question at hand.
