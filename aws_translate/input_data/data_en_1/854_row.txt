[Question]Clara brings a package of 100 stickers to school. She gives 10 stickers to a boy she likes. She gives half of the stickers which she has left to her best friends. How many stickers does Clara have left?
[Answer]She gives the boy she likes 10 stickers. After giving the boy his stickers, she has 100 – 10 = 90 stickers left. She gives her best friends 90 / 2 = 45 stickers. This leaves Clara with 90 – 45 stickers = 45 stickers. The answer is 45.
Q: Martin is organizing a party, and he invited many of his colleagues. He invited 5 people from his hometown and twice as many people from his school. Martin invited also as many people from his sports club as the sum of people invited from his hometown and his school. The remaining invitations represent 20% of the total previously mentioned. How many people can potentially come to the party Martin is organizing?
A: Martin invited 5 * 2 = 10 people from his school. People from the sports club got 5 + 10 = 15 invitations. So in total from the sports club, hometown and school, Martin invited 5 + 10 + 15 = 30 people. All other invitations are 20% of the previous total, which means 20 / 100 * 30 = 6. That means Martin invited to his party 30 + 6 = 36 people. The answer is 36.
Question: It's Ava's birthday party. Her parents bought a unicorn piñata for $13 and filled it with all of her favorite treats. They bought 4 bags of Reese's for $9 per bag, 3 bags of Snickers for $5 per bag, and 5 bags of Skittles for $7 per bag. How much did the unicorn piñata and the treats cost altogether?
Answer: The four bags of Reese's cost $9 x 4 = $36. The three bags of Snickers cost $5 x 3 = $15. The five bags of Skittles cost $7 x 5 = $35. Therefore, the unicorn piñata and the treats cost $13 + $36 + $15 + $35 = $99. The answer is 99.
[Question]Leo's assignment was divided into three parts. He finished the first part of his assignment in 25 minutes. It took him twice as long to finish the second part. If he was able to finish his assignment in 2 hours, how many minutes did Leo finish the third part of the assignment?
[Answer]It took Leo 25 x 2 = 50 minutes to finish the second part of the assignment. Leo finished the first and second parts of the assignment in 25 + 50 = 75 minutes. He finished the entire assignment in 60 x 2 = 120 minutes. Therefore, it took Leo 120 - 75 = 45 minutes to finish the third part of the assignment. The answer is 45.
Q: The profit from a business transaction is shared among 2 business partners, Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5 respectively. If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?
A: According to the ratio, for every 5 parts that Johnson gets, Mike gets 2 parts. Since Johnson got $2500, each part is therefore $2500 / 5 = $500. Mike will get 2 * $500 = $1000. After buying the shirt he will have $1000 - $200 = $800 left. The answer is 800.
