[Question]The number of cards in a card game was 500. Two friends Ellis and Orion, playing together, divided the cards in the ratio of 11:9. How many more cards did Ellis get than Orion?
[Answer]The total ratio representing the 500 cards is 11 + 9 = 20. The fraction of the total ratio that represents the number of cards that Ellis got is 11 / 20, and since there were 500 cards, Ellis got 11 / 20 * 500 = 275. If there were 500 cards, and Ellis received 275 cards, Orion received 500 - 275 = 225 cards. The number of cards that Ellis received more than Orion is 275 - 225 = 50 cards. The answer is 50.
Q: Santana has 7 brothers. 3 of them have birthdays in March, 1 of them has a birthday in October, 1 has a birthday in November, and another 2 of them were born in December. If Santana always buys each of her brothers a birthday present and a Christmas present, how many more presents does she have to buy in the second half of the year than the first half of the year?
A: Santana has 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 brothers with birthdays in the second half of the year. She has 7 brothers - 4 brothers = 3 brothers with birthdays in the first half of the year. Altogether, she has to buy 4 + 7 = 11 presents in the second half of the year. Therefore, she has to buy 11 - 3 = 8 more presents in the second half of the year. The answer is 8.
Question: I went to the music shop and there were CDs of The Life Journey for $100, A Day a Life for $50, and When You Rescind for $85 on display. If I bought 3 of each CD to share with my friends, what's the total amount of money I spent in the shop?
Answer: The total cost of The Life Journey is 3 × $100 = $300. The total cost of When You Rescind is 3 × $85 = $255. The total cost of A Day a Life is 3 × $50 = $150. The total cost for all the CDs is $150 + $255 + $300 = $705. The answer is 705.
[Question]Brad’s zip code consists of five numbers that add up to 10. The first and second numbers are the same. The third number is zero. The fourth number is double the first number. The fourth and fifth numbers add up to 8. What is Brad’s zip code?
[Answer]The five numbers add up to 10, so the first three numbers add up to 10 - 8 = 2. The third number is 0, so the first two numbers add up to 2 - 0 = 2. The first and second numbers are equal, so they are both 2 / 2 = 1. The fourth number is double the first number, so it is 2 * 1 = 2. The fifth number is 8 - 2 = 6. Thus, Brad’s zip code is 11026. The answer is 11026.
