As Ludlow digs deeper into the evidence, he discovers a pattern that links the abducted people to a multi-billion-dollar deal being negotiated between the government and a private corporation. Initially, Ludlow suspects that the kidnappings are the work of a rival corporation, aiming to sabotage the deal. His investigations lead him to encounter a disgraced former cop turned informant, who drops subtle hints that point Ludlow in the right direction: Captain Wander.
