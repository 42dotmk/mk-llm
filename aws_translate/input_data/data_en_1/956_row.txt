The provided statement does not directly answer the question regarding the belief of Eastern Orthodox Christians on the story of a Virgin mother for Mary and those who follow its teaching. However, the statement does shed light on the Eastern Orthodox perspective on the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, which is related to the broader topic.

To provide a detailed understanding of the Eastern Orthodox Christian beliefs on the story of the Virgin Mary and its significance for followers of the faith, we need to explore the concept of Mary's 'immaculate conception' and its relationship with the doctrines of 'ancestral sin' and 'original sin.'

First, let us examine the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. According to Roman Catholic doctrine, the Immaculate Conception refers to the belief that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was conceived without original sin. In other words, the Immaculate Conception teaches that from the moment of her conception, Mary was free from the stain of original sin that affects all human beings.

On the other hand, Eastern Orthodox Christianity does not formally accept the dogmatic declaration of the Immaculate Conception. The statement provided explains that contemporary Eastern Orthodox Christians often object to the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception because they perceive it as an "over-elaboration" of the faith and closely connected to a particular interpretation of the doctrine of ancestral sin.

Ancestral sin, in Eastern Orthodox theology, is understood differently from the Western Christian concept of original sin. Ancestral sin emphasizes that human beings inherit the consequences of Adam and Eve's disobedience, such as death, suffering, and the inclination towards sin, rather than inheriting their guilt. This distinction impacts the Eastern Orthodox view on the need for Mary's Immaculate Conception, as they do not believe that human beings are born guilty of original sin, and therefore, there is no inherent requirement for Mary to be preserved from it.

Eastern Orthodox Christians venerate Mary as Theotokos, which means the "Mother of God" or "God-bearer." While they do not hold the specific doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, they still acknowledge and honor Mary's role as a unique and sinless human being chosen to give birth to Jesus Christ. They believe that Mary was prepared by God from her conception to be the mother of Jesus, but they do not explicitly attribute this to her being preserved from the ancestral sin.

In conclusion, the provided statement addresses the Eastern Orthodox Christians' perspective on the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, but it does not fully answer the question regarding their beliefs on the story of the Virgin Mary and the significance for those who follow its teaching. According to Eastern Orthodox Christianity, Mary is highly venerated as Theotokos, and her sinless nature is acknowledged. However, the Immaculate Conception is not considered an essential doctrine by the Eastern Orthodox Church, as it is related more to the Western Christian understanding of original sin rather than the Eastern doctrine of ancestral sin.
