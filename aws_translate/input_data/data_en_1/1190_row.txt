The successor improvement that made a significant contribution to sanitation in Paris during Napoleon III's reign and Haussmann's tenure as prefect of the Seine can be credited to a combination of several pivotal advancements in urban planning and infrastructure. One of the most notable improvements was the construction and modernization of the city's sewer system under their guidance.

Before delving into the details of these improvements, it is essential to acknowledge the background and context of the time. In the mid-19th century, the streets of Paris were congested, and the city's infrastructure was deteriorating. This led to a multitude of sanitation issues, including poor waste management, contaminated drinking water, and the rapid spread of diseases such as cholera. Napoleon III and Haussmann were determined to address these problems through a series of large-scale public works projects aimed at transforming Paris into a modern, clean, and functional city.

One major successor improvement that significantly contributed to sanitation was the development of a centralized and efficient sewer system. Under Haussmann's direction, an expansive network of sewers was constructed, replacing the outdated and insufficient sewer system that predated their administration. These new sewers were larger and better equipped to handle the increasing amounts of waste produced by Paris' growing population. Additionally, they were designed to prevent waste accumulation and facilitate regular maintenance, which greatly improved overall sanitation and the health of the city.

In conjunction with the new sewer system, Haussmann's efforts to redesign the streets of Paris also had a significant impact on sanitation. The construction of wide boulevards enabled better circulation of air and sunlight, reducing dampness and improving overall cleanliness. Furthermore, these wider streets facilitated easier access for sanitation workers and other officials tasked with maintaining clean and healthy conditions in the city.

Another key improvement was the construction of new aqueducts and water infrastructure to supply clean water to the city's inhabitants. By providing a centrally controlled and regulated supply of water, it became easier to prevent contamination and ensure the overall safety and hygiene of the city's drinking water supply.

Lastly, the creation of new parks, such as the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes, contributed to improved sanitation by providing green spaces for residents to enjoy. These parks not only offered recreational opportunities but also functioned as "lungs" for the city, offering fresh air and enhancing the overall quality of the urban environment.

In conclusion, the successor improvement that contributed to sanitation in Paris during Napoleon III's reign and Haussmann's tenure as the prefect of the Seine can be attributed to an array of advancements in urban planning, infrastructure, sewer systems, and water supply management. These large-scale public works projects radically transformed the city, laying the foundation for modern Paris and its impressive standards of cleanliness and public health.
