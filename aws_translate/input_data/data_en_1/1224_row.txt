To answer your questions, I will first provide the main arguments of the dissenting justices against the ruling in favor of same-sex marriage and then explain why the Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriages. Finally, I will determine if the answers to these questions are the same.

Question 1:
The main arguments of the dissenting justices against the ruling in favor of same-sex marriages in the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court case, Obergefell v. Hodges, were as follows:

1. Chief Justice John Roberts argued that the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be left to the legislative process, as opposed to being determined by the courts. He expressed concern for the implications of judicial overreach, emphasizing that the Constitution does not explicitly guarantee the right to same-sex marriage.

2. Justice Antonin Scalia criticized the majority decision as a threat to democracy and as an overreach of judicial power. He believed that the matter of same-sex marriage should be decided by the people through democratic processes, not by an unelected judiciary.

3. Justice Clarence Thomas questioned the fundamental right to same-sex marriage, arguing that it was not rooted in the Constitution. He also raised concerns about how the ruling would impact religious liberty and maintained that states, rather than the federal government, should have the power to regulate marriage.

4. Justice Samuel Alito worried that the decision could lead to potential conflicts with religious freedom for those who hold traditional views on marriage. He too argued that the definition of marriage should be determined by the democratic process.

Question 2:
The Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriages in Obergefell v. Hodges for several reasons:

1. Equal protection under the law: The majority opinion, authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy, stated that the 14th Amendment guarantees equal protection under the law, including the right to marry for same-sex couples. Denying this right would be a violation of due process and equal protection.

2. Marriage as a fundamental right: The Court determined that the right to marry is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution. Thus, any restrictions on individuals based on their sexual orientation would be subject to strict scrutiny, and the states' bans on same-sex marriage failed to meet this high standard.

3. Dignity and autonomy: The majority opinion emphasized that marriage conferred dignity and respect on couples and that denying same-sex couples the right to marry would be a violation of their dignity and autonomy.

Lemma: From the given options A) No and B) Yes;
Would the answer to these two questions be the same?

Since the dissenting justices' arguments focused on concerns regarding judicial overreach, deference to the democratic process, the interpretation of the Constitution, and concerns about religious liberty, while the Supreme Court's majority opinion emphasized equal protection, fundamental rights, and dignity and autonomy, the answers are fundamentally different in their reasoning.

Therefore, I choose A) No, the answer to these two questions would not be the same.
