Question: For the family reunion, Peter is buying 16 pounds of bone-in chicken and half that amount in hamburgers. He's going to buy 2 more pounds of hot dogs than hamburgers. He's also going to buy several sides that will weigh half the amount of hot dogs. How many pounds of food will he buy?
Answer: He is buying 16 pounds of chicken and half that amount in hamburgers so he's buying 16 / 2 = 8 pounds of hamburgers. He's going to buy 2 more pounds of hotdogs than hamburgers, which are 8 pounds so he'll have 2 + 8 = 10 pounds of hot dogs. He's going to buy sides that weigh half the amount of the hot dogs so that's 10 / 2 = 5 pounds of sides. He's buying 16 pounds of chicken, 8 pounds of hamburgers, 10 pounds of hot dogs and 5 pounds of sides for a total of 16 + 8 + 10 + 5 = 39 pounds of food. The answer is 39.

She also knows she needs 3 ounces of sunscreen each application and a bottle contain 12 ounces and costs $3.5. If she is there for 16 hours, how much will the sunscreen cost?
A: She needs to apply sunscreen 8 times because 16 / 2 = 8. She will use 24 ounces of sunscreen because 3 x 8 = 24. This will take 2 bottles because 24 / 12 = 2. This will cost $7 because 2 x 3.5 = 7. The answer is 7.

Answer: Haylee has 3 x 12 = 36 guppies. Jose has 36 / 2 = 18 guppies. Charliz has 18 / 3 = 6 guppies. Nicolai has 6 x 4 = 24 guppies. Altogether, the four friends have 36 + 18 + 6 + 24 = 84 guppies. The answer is 84.
[Question]An animal shelter is having a pet adoption event where owners can adopt an animal for just the cost of the vet fees. Vet fees for dogs are $15, and vet fees for cats are $13. Eight families adopt dogs and three adopt cats. The vet donates a third of the fees they were paid for the adoption checkups back to the shelter. How many dollars did the vet donate?
[Answer]The vet made 8 * 15 = $120 in dog vet fees. The vet made 3 * 13 = $39 in cat vet fees. The total vet fees were 120 + 39 = $159. The vet donated 1 / 3 of the fees, so they donated 159 / 3 = $53 back to the shelter. The answer is 53.
