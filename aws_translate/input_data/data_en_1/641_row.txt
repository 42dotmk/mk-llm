The entry of acidic chyme into the duodenum stimulates the release of several substances, primarily hormones and enzymes, which aid in digestion and neutralization of the acidic chyme. The primary substances released are:

1. Secretin: Secretin is a hormone produced by the S-cells of the duodenal mucosa. It is released in response to the presence of acidic chyme in the duodenum. The primary role of secretin is to stimulate the secretion of bicarbonate (HCO3-) by the pancreas, which helps to neutralize the acidic chyme and to promote a more alkaline environment for the proper functioning of digestive enzymes. Secretin also inhibits gastric acid secretion and motility, further helping to regulate the acidic environment in the duodenum.

2. Cholecystokinin (CCK): CCK is a hormone produced by the I-cells of the duodenal and jejunal mucosa. It is released in response to the presence of fatty acids and certain amino acids in the chyme. CCK stimulates the contraction of the gallbladder, releasing bile into the duodenum. Bile aids in the emulsification and digestion of fats. CCK also promotes pancreatic enzyme secretion, particularly lipases, proteases, and amylases, which are crucial for the digestion of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, respectively.

3. Pancreatic enzymes: Along with the secretion of bicarbonate, the enzymes that are released by the pancreas into the duodenum include trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, proelastase, procarboxypeptidase A and B, lipase, colipase, and amylase. These enzymes are released in their inactive form (zymogens) and are activated in the duodenum by various mechanisms including the action of enterokinase and trypsin. These enzymes play a critical role in breaking down proteins, fats, and carbohydrates to their basic components, allowing for their absorption across the intestinal lining.

4. Bile: Bile is produced by hepatocytes (liver cells) and stored in the gallbladder. Upon stimulation by CCK, bile is released into the duodenum through the common bile duct. Bile is composed of bile salts, which help to emulsify and solubilize fats, aiding in their digestion and absorption. Bile also contains bilirubin, a waste product from the breakdown of hemoglobin, which is eliminated from the body via the digestive tract.

5. Gastrointestinal peptides: In addition to CCK and secretin, other gastrointestinal peptides are released in response to the presence of chyme in the duodenum. These include gastrin, which stimulates acid secretion and gastric motility; gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), which inhibits gastric acid secretion and motility; motilin, which stimulates gastrointestinal motility; and somatostatin, which inhibits the release of several gastrointestinal hormones, including gastrin and secretin.

In summary, the entry of acidic chyme into the duodenum stimulates the release of hormones (secretin and CCK), enzymes (pancreatic enzymes), and bile, which work collectively to neutralize the acidity, digest macronutrients, and facilitate nutrient absorption. These substances are crucial for maintaining optimal digestive system function and overall health.
