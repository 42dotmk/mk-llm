When cans of soft drinks at 28°C are lowered into a flowing stream containing water at 18°C, several physical phenomena will likely occur. Some of the most prominent effects include heat transfer, temperature equilibrium, and possible changes to the stream's ecosystem.

1. Heat Transfer: The predominant occurrence in this situation is the transfer of heat between the soft drink cans and the water in the stream. Since the soft drinks are at a higher temperature (28°C) compared to the water in the stream (18°C), heat will transfer from the cans to the water until both reach a state of thermal equilibrium.

2. Conduction: The transfer of heat between the two substances will occur through the process of conduction. Conduction is the exchange of thermal energy between two adjacent materials in direct contact. In this case, the soft drink cans and the water in the stream are in direct contact, allowing thermal energy to flow from the higher-temperature cans to the lower-temperature water.

3. Temperature Equilibrium: Over time, the temperature of the soft drink cans and the stream water will approach equilibrium, at which point the rate of heat transfer between the two will slow and eventually stop. The final temperature of the soft drink cans and the water will be somewhere between 18°C and 28°C, depending on the specific heat capacities of the can materials, the soft drinks, and the water, as well as the mass ratios and the initial temperature difference.

4. Convection Currents: As the heat transfers from the cans to the water, local convection currents may form due to the changes in water density with temperature. Warmer water surrounding the cans will become less dense and rise, while cooler water nearby will sink, creating a natural circulation that promotes further heat transfer.

5. Changes to Stream Ecosystem: Although this is not a direct result of the temperature change, submerging cans of soft drinks in a stream could have potential consequences on the stream's environment. If the cans were not sealed properly, the contents might leak into the water, potentially introducing contaminants that could harm plant and animal life within the stream.

6. Thermal Shock: This phenomenon is not expected to occur in this case, as both the cans and the stream's water temperatures are not extreme enough to cause rapid or severe damage to the soft drink cans or the surrounding environment. However, if the temperature difference were significant, rapid heat transfer could lead to structural damage to the cans or even a rapid temperature change in the immediate vicinity that could be harmful to aquatic life.

In conclusion, when cans of soft drinks at 28°C are lowered into a stream containing water at 18°C, the most likely occurrence is heat transfer between the two until they reach temperature equilibrium. This process will happen through conduction, the direct exchange of thermal energy between substances in contact. Convection currents may form in the vicinity, promoting further heat transfer. Although unlikely, potential ecological impacts and thermal shock could also occur under specific circumstances.
