Q: Jenny is trying to convince her cat to walk on a leash. The cat spends twenty minutes resisting. Then Jenny coaxes the cat to walk 64 feet at a rate of 8 feet/minute. How many minutes does this whole process take?
A: First find how many minutes the cat spends walking: 64 feet / 8 feet / minute = 8 minutes. Then add this to the time the cat spent resisting to find the total amount of time: 8 minutes + 20 minutes = 28 minutes. The answer is 28.
Question: Linda is building a new hotel with two wings. The first wing has 9 floors and each floor has 6 halls each with 32 rooms. The second wing has 7 floors each with 9 halls with 40 rooms each. How many rooms are in the hotel total?
Answer: First find the number of rooms per floor in the first wing: 32 rooms / hall * 6 halls / floor = 192 rooms / floor. Then find the total number of rooms in the first wing by multiplying that number by the number of floors: 192 rooms / floor * 9 floors = 1728 rooms. Then find the number of rooms per floor in the second wing: 40 rooms / hall * 9 halls / floor = 360 rooms / floor. Then find the total number of rooms in the second wing by multiplying that number by the number of floors: 360 rooms / floor * 7 floors = 2520 rooms. Then add the total number of rooms in each wing to find the overall total: 1728 rooms + 2520 rooms = 4248 rooms. The answer is 4248.
[Question]Grayson has 100 questions on a test. He answers some of the questions for 2 hours, taking two minutes for each answer, then realizes he doesn't know the rest of the questions. How many questions does Grayson leave unanswered when he submits his test?

Question: An archaeologist discovered three dig sites from different periods in one area. The archaeologist dated the first dig site as 352 years more recent than the second dig site. The third dig site was dated 3700 years older than the first dig site. The fourth dig site was twice as old as the third dig site. The archaeologist studied the fourth dig siteâ€™s relics and gave the site a date of 8400 BC. What year did the archaeologist date the second dig site?
Answer: The third dig site was dated from the year 8400 / 2 = 4200 BC. Thus, the first dig site was dated from the year 4200 - 3700 = 500 BC. The second dig site was 352 years older, so it was dated from the year 500 + 352 = 852 BC. The answer is 852.
