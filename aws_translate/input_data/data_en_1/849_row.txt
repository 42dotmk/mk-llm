To ensure that worms in your worm bin do not get injured on the mesh grate, you should consider a combination of measures and choose a design that best caters to the needs of the worms. Here are several approaches to accomplish this goal:

1. Choose the right mesh size: Selecting the appropriate mesh size for the grate is critical in preventing worms from injury. A mesh size of 1/8 inch (3mm) is recommended because it is large enough for worm castings to pass through, but small enough to prevent the worms from squeezing through and getting injured. Additionally, a finer mesh can help in keeping pests, flies, and other unwanted creatures out of your worm bin.

2. Smooth the edges of the mesh grate: When you cut the mesh to fit your worm bin, the cut edges can be sharp and cause injuries to your worms. To prevent this, you can smooth out the cut edges by using sandpaper or a metal file. This will reduce the risk of injury to the worms as they move around in the bin.

3. Layer the bottom of the worm bin: Adding a layer of damp, shredded newspapers, or coir (coconut fiber) at the bottom of your worm bin on top of the mesh grate provides a soft and comfortable environment for the worms while offering protection from any potential harm caused by the mesh. Make sure the coir or newspaper layer is moist, as this encourages the worms to stay within the bedding material.

4. Add worm bedding material: Worm bedding provides a comfortable living environment for the worms and helps reduce the chances of them coming in contact with the mesh grate. You can use a variety of materials like shredded newspapers, coir (coconut fiber), aged compost, or a mixture of these. The bedding material should be thoroughly moistened and fluffed up before adding it to the bin. This is an essential step to creating a safe home for your worms.

5. Regularly maintain the worm bin: Regular maintenance of your worm bin is vital for a healthy worm population and in preventing worm injuries. Make sure the moisture levels in the bin are optimal, and the worms have sufficient bedding material and food. If the worms stay deep within the bin where the conditions are more favorable, they are less likely to come in contact with the mesh grate. Periodically check the mesh grate for wear and tear, and replace it if necessary.

6. Design of the worm bin: You may consider using a worm bin design with separate compartments instead of using a single bin with a mesh grate. The Worm Factory 360 is an excellent example of this design. It has multiple trays that can be stacked upon one another. The worms naturally migrate upwards toward fresh food sources, leaving the bottom tray full of worm castings. This also reduces the chance of worms getting injured on a mesh grate.

In summary, the best way to meet your goal of preventing worm injury is to use an appropriate mesh size, smooth the edges, add a layer of bedding on the mesh grate, provide ample worm bedding material, perform regular maintenance, and consider using a multi-tray worm bin system. By taking these precautions, you can create a safe and healthy environment for your worms to thrive.
