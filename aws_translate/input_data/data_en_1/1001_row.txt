The bizarre series of incidents has left authorities scrambling for answers and travelers in disarray as investigation progresses.

Step 1: Describe the scene at the airport 

At around 3 AM, smoke was reported billowing from a building within the vicinity of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. Firefighters quickly arrived on the scene and discovered that the situation was much graver than initially anticipated. The flames were quickly becoming out of control, prompting airport authorities to halt all flight operations in and out of the area.

Step 2: Mention the discovery of the man and his condition

As firefighters were working to contain the blaze, they stumbled upon a man who appeared to have sustained several severe self-inflicted wounds. Witnesses reported seeing the man lying on the ground, bleeding profusely, and mumbling incoherently. He was rushed to a nearby hospital where he is currently receiving medical attention. Authorities have yet to reveal his identity or further details about his condition.

Step 3: Explain the impact on Chicago-area airports

Due to the intensity of the fire, coupled with safety concerns and the ongoing investigation, all nearby airports, including both O'Hare and Midway International Airports, have temporarily halted flight operations. This sudden and unexpected disruption has caused chaos for countless passengers either attempting to leave or arrive in the Chicago metro area. Many travelers have been left stranded, frustrated and concerned over the unusual circumstances.

Step 4: Discuss the ongoing investigation 

Authorities are now actively investigating the troubling situation and are working diligently to ascertain the root cause of the fire, as well as any potential connection with the injured man found on site. While no official statements have been made, authorities are leaning towards the possible conclusion that the man might have played a role in igniting the fire, potentially as an act of arson or an attempt to cause mass destruction.

Step 5: Address the current status and future plans

As investigators continue to work on the case, both O'Hare and Midway International Airports remain closed indefinitely. However, airport officials are working closely with the authorities and hope to resume flights as soon as it is deemed safe to do so. Passengers are advised to check with their airline for updated information on flight schedules and potential alternative arrangements.
