Based on the 2014 Myanmar Census, there are significant portions of workers in various sectors and locations. With a population of 51,419,420, we can infer that a substantial number of people are employed in different industries throughout the country. The census includes an estimated 1,206,353 persons in northern Rakhine State, Kachin State, and Kayin State who were not counted, implying that the actual worker population may be even higher. Additionally, it is important to note that people who were out of the country at the time of the census are not included in these figures, which further suggests that the total number of workers from Myanmar could be greater than the mentioned population.

One prominent location where a significant portion of Myanmar's workers can be found is in Thailand. There are over 600,000 registered migrant workers from Myanmar in the country, and millions more are working there illegally. Burmese migrant workers account for a whopping 80% of Thailand's migrant worker population. This massive presence of Myanmar's workers in Thailand demonstrates the significant contribution of Burmese citizens to Thailand's economy and workforce.

Within Myanmar itself, workers are likely distributed across various industries, including agriculture, manufacturing, services, and construction. The country has a population density of 76 per square kilometer (200/sq mi), which is among the lowest in Southeast Asia. This low population density suggests that people are spread out across the country, working in different sectors and regions.

Agriculture has traditionally been the backbone of Myanmar's economy, employing a large percentage of the population. With its fertile soils and abundant natural resources, Myanmar has been able to support a predominantly agricultural-based workforce that grows rice, pulses, beans, and other crops, as well as engaging in livestock rearing and fisheries-related jobs.

The manufacturing sector in Myanmar has also been expanding with the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly in the textile and garment, food processing, and construction industries. Consequently, a significant number of workers are employed in these manufacturing operations.

The services sector also employs a large segment of the population, with jobs in areas such as education, healthcare, and hospitality catering to both the domestic and international markets. Additionally, the growing tourism industry has contributed to increased opportunities for those employed in the service sector.

Construction is another sector that boasts a significant portion of Myanmar's workforce. With continuous investments in infrastructure development, such as transport, energy, and urban improvements, the demand for skilled and unskilled laborers has risen.

In summary, there are significant portions of workers from Myanmar both within the country and abroad, particularly in Thailand. These workers are employed in various sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, services, and construction, contributing to the overall economic growth and development of Myanmar and its neighboring countries.
