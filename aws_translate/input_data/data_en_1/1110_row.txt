[Question]A soccer ball takes twenty minutes to inflate. Alexia and Ermias are inflating balls, with Alexia inflating 20 balls and Ermias inflating 5 more balls than Alexia. Calculate the total time in minutes they took to inflate all the soccer balls.
[Answer]To inflate a soccer ball, it takes 20 minutes, and if Alexia inflated 20 soccer balls, she took 20 * 20 = 400 minutes. Ermias has 5 more soccer balls than Alexia, meaning she has a total of 20 + 5 = 25 soccer balls. If each soccer ball takes 20 minutes to inflate, Ermias took 25 * 20 = 500 minutes to inflate all the soccer balls she had. Alexia and Ermias took 400 + 500 = 900 minutes to inflate all the soccer balls. The answer is 900.
Q: Mason has 3 cartons of 200 blueberries. He makes as many muffins as he can with 10 blueberries per muffin. Then he makes 60 cinnamon muffins. What percentage of all the muffins he made have blueberries?
A: First find the total number of blueberries Mason has: 200 blueberries / carton * 3 cartons = 600 blueberries. Then divide the total number of blueberries by the number of blueberries per muffin: 600 blueberries / 10 blueberries / muffin = 60 muffins. Then add that number of muffins to the number of cinnamon muffins to find the total number of muffins: 60 muffins + 60 muffins = 120 muffins. Then divide the number of blueberry muffins by the total number of muffins and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 60 muffins / 120 muffins * 100% = 50%. The answer is 50.
Question: Marco uses a fifth of an ounce of dry tea leaves to brew his morning cup of tea each day. He buys tea leaves in boxes of 28 ounces. How many weeks of daily tea does Marco get from a box?
Answer: Marco gets 28 / 1 / 5 = 28 * 5 = 140 cups of tea from a box. At 7 days a week, Marco gets 140 / 7 = 20 weeks of daily tea from a box. The answer is 20.
[Question]Susan had a sum of money. She spent 1/5 of it in September, 1/4 of it in October, and $120 in November. After spending these amounts of money, she still had $540 left. How much money did she have at first?
[Answer]Let X be the amount Susan had originally. Susan spent 1 / 5 * X in September, 1 / 4 * X in October, and $120 in November. Susan has X - 1 / 5 * X - 1 / 4 * X - $120 = $540 left. Combining like terms, we get 11 / 20 * X - $120 = $540. Adding $120 to both sides, we get 11 / 20 * X = $660. Dividing both sides by 11 / 20 we get X = $1200. The answer is 1200.
Q: A baker sells pastries for $5 and works 7 days a week. On Monday he sold 2. Every day the number of sales increases by 1 compared to the previous day. On average, how many pastries does he sell on each day of the week?
A: You know from the statement that on Monday he sells 2 pastries, so on Tuesday he sells 3, Wednesday 4, Thursday 5, Friday 6, Saturday 7 and Sunday 8 pastries. So the average value is (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) pastries / 7 days. The baker sells, on average, 35 / 7 = 5 pastries / day for 1 week. The answer is 5.
