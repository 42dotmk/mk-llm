The provided data, "Andrews County Airport, 3rdRunwayLengthFeet, 2939", refers to specific details about a particular airport located in Andrews County. In this case, the focus is on the length of the 3rd runway at the airport, which is 2939 feet long. To better understand this information, let's break down each component and discuss them in more detail, starting with the location, the airport's general features, and finally the importance of runway length.

Location: Andrews County

The airport mentioned in the data is situated in Andrews County, a region in the state of Texas, United States. This county is located in the western part of the state, and its seat is the city of Andrews. The airport is utilized by the local community for transportation, connecting the area with other regional airports and serving domestic air travel needs.

Airport Facilities

The Andrews County Airport typically serves general aviation needs, which include private, corporate, and recreational flights. Many smaller airports like this one do not have regularly scheduled commercial flights; however, they often provide important services, such as charter flights, emergency services, flight training, and maintenance. Airports of this size have runways, taxiways, and aprons to accommodate various types of aircraft, including small propeller-driven airplanes and helicopters. Some might also house control towers, fueling stations, hangars, and terminal buildings to support the arrival and departure of passengers and crew members, along with their parking facilities.

3rd Runway Length

In this particular data set, the focus lies on the length of the 3rd runway, which stands at 2939 feet. Runway length is essential for pilots and aviation planners to gauge whether the runway is suitable for a specific type of aircraft, as it can directly impact takeoff and landing safety. Factors that determine the required runway length include aircraft type, flight distance, airplane gross weight, air temperature (density altitude), and wind conditions.

A 2939-foot-long runway, as in this case, is suitable for small- to medium-sized general aviation aircraft, as well as certain light business jets. These aircraft types can safely operate on shorter runways compared to large commercial jets since their takeoff and landing requirements are lower, allowing for efficient utilization of this specific airport.

It's important to note that runway lengths can vary greatly depending on these parameters, so pilots and operators must consider their specific requirements carefully before attempting takeoffs and landings.

In conclusion, the data provided outlines essential information about an airport located in Andrews County that serves the local community and its aviation needs. The length of the 3rd runway at 2939 feet offers a suitable ground infrastructure for small- to medium-sized aircraft, contributing to the safe and efficient operation of flights in and out of the Andrews County Airport. It is crucial for airport management, pilots, and aviation authorities to understand these variables for optimal functioning and the safety of all involved.
