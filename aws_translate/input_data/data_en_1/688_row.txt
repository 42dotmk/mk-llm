Q: Nalani had two female dogs that were expecting and after a month gave birth to 10 puppies each. She then sold 3/4 of the puppies after they came of age, each at $200. Calculate the total amount of money she received from the sale of the puppies.
A: If the two expectant dogs gave birth to 10 puppies each, the total number of puppies Nalani had is 10 + 10 = 20. When they came of age, Nalani sold 3 / 4 of the dogs, a total of 3 / 4 * 20 = 15 dogs. If each dog sold for $200, Nalani received 15 * 200 = $3000 from the sale of the dogs. The answer is 3000.
Question: A Moroccan restaurant received 3 different shipments of couscous. The first two shipments of 7 and 13 pounds arrived on the same day. The next day's shipment was 45 pounds of couscous. If it takes 5 pounds of couscous to make a dish, how many dishes did the restaurant make?
Answer: The first two shipments of couscous added up to 7 + 13 = 20 pounds. Adding that weight to the next day’s shipment results in a total weight of 20 + 45 = 65 pounds. Since each dish takes 5 pounds, then the restaurant makes 65 / 5 = 13 dishes. The answer is 13.
[Question]The number of soldiers on opposite sides of a war each needs 10 pounds of food every day to continue fighting effectively. However, soldiers in the second are each given 2 pounds less food than the first side. If the first side has 4000 soldiers and the other side 500 soldiers fewer than the first side, what's the total amount of pounds of food both sides are eating altogether every day?
[Answer]The first side with 4000 soldiers is eating 4000 * 10 = 40000 pounds of food every day. Since the other side has 500 soldiers fewer than the first side, there are 4000 - 500 = 3500 soldiers on the second side. Soldiers on the second side are each given 10 - 2 = 8 pounds of food. The total amount of food the second side eats is 8 * 3500 = 28000. Altogether, the two sides eat 28000 + 40000 = 68000 pounds of food every day. The answer is 68000.
Q: The distance from Anthony’s apartment to work is 10 miles. How far away is the gym from his apartment if it is 2 miles more than half the distance from his apartment to work?
A: Half the distance from his apartment to work is 10 miles / 2 = 5 miles. The gym is 2 more miles than this distance so is 2 + 5 = 7 miles away from his apartment. The answer is 7.
Question: James works for 240 minutes. He takes a water break every 20 minutes and a sitting break every 120 minutes. How many more water breaks does he take than sitting breaks?
Answer: First find the number of water breaks James takes: 240 minutes / 20 minutes / water break = 12 water breaks. Then find the number of sitting breaks James takes: 240 minutes / 120 minutes / sitting break = 2 sitting breaks. Then subtract the number of sitting breaks from the number of water breaks to find the difference: 12 breaks - 2 breaks = 10 breaks. The answer is 10.
