One of the primary reasons that the use of computers became more widely used can be attributed to the emergence and rapid expansion of computer networking, particularly the development of the Internet. This phenomenon greatly enhanced the capabilities of individual computers by enabling them to connect with others, access shared resources, and communicate more efficiently. There are several factors that contributed to this widespread adoption, some of which include the evolution of computing technology, the growth of user-friendly applications, and the advancement of affordable networking infrastructure.

Firstly, advancements in computing technology played a vital role in the proliferation of computers. Over time, computers have evolved to become more powerful, efficient, and affordable, allowing a broader range of users to access and utilize them. This democratization of technology significantly increased the potential user base, which in turn stimulated the demand for computer networking, as users sought to capitalize on the inherent benefits of interconnected systems.

Secondly, the development of user-friendly applications such as e-mail and the World Wide Web further contributed to the widespread adoption of computers. These applications simplified complex tasks and made them accessible to a larger user base, allowing individuals to communicate more efficiently and access vast amounts of information with ease. The growth of these applications, in turn, reinforced the need for robust computer networks, as they required reliable and efficient means of transferring data between users and systems.

Additionally, the introduction of inexpensive and fast networking technologies, such as Ethernet and ADSL, made it more feasible for a greater number of users to access and participate in computer networks. These technologies significantly reduced the costs associated with setting up and maintaining networks, and they also provided faster data transfer rates, making networking an even more attractive proposition for users.

Another important factor that contributed to the increased use of computers was the rise of "wireless" networking, which enabled network connectivity without the need for physical cables. This development greatly expanded the scope of computer networking by allowing users to remain connected even in mobile computing environments. The utilization of mobile phone networks for wireless networking has ensured that networking continues to grow more ubiquitous as mobile devices become increasingly prevalent in everyday life.

In conclusion, the widespread adoption of computers can be largely attributed to the emergence of computer networking, specifically the development of the Internet. As computing technology evolved, users sought to maximize its potential through interconnected systems, resulting in the rapid expansion of networking. The growth of user-friendly applications, affordable networking technologies, and wireless connectivity has further reinforced the importance of networking in modern computing, leading to a world where computers have become an integral part of daily life for many people.
