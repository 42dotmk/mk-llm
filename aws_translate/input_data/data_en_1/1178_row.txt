In Rugby Union, the number 15 jersey is worn by the player who plays the position of Fullback. The Fullback is the last line of defense and plays a crucial role both in defense and attack. This position is known for its versatility, as the player needs to possess a wide range of skills and abilities to contribute effectively to the team. Basically, the Fullback is responsible for the following tasks:

1. Fielding kicks: The Fullback stands at the back of the field to collect deep kicks from the opposition. They must be able to judge where the ball will land and sprint to reach the ball in time. They must also be proficient in catching high balls securely, to avoid fumbling and providing attacking opportunities to the opponent.

2. Counter-attacking: One of the primary duties of a Fullback is to counter-attack and initiate attacking plays. After fielding a kick, they must assess the situation quickly and decide whether to kick the ball back, pass it to a teammate, or make a run with the ball themselves. Quick decision-making is vital in this scenario.

3. Kicking: Fullbacks are often skilled kickers with strong kicking abilities. They are usually called upon for tactical kicks, such as long punts down the field to relieve pressure or gain territory, and for goal kicks. Effective kicking skills can help change the flow of the game, so Fullbacks must be consistently accurate when striking the ball.

4. Last line of defense: As the last defensive player on the team, Fullbacks need to be excellent tacklers. They should be able to bring down opponents making a break through the defensive line by anticipating their movement and using strong tackling technique.

5. Positioning: Fullbacks must have a deep understanding of the game and constantly manage their positioning on the field. They need to anticipate where the attack will occur and move accordingly to support their teammates and cover potential gaps in the defensive line.

6. Communication: Fullbacks are often the eyes and ears of the team, as they have a clear view of the entire field from their position. They must communicate effectively with their team, especially the defensive line, to alert them of incoming threats and help organize defensive strategies.

7. Agility and speed: Fullbacks need to have excellent agility and speed, as they often confront opponents in one-on-one situations during counter-attacks or defensive maneuvers. They must be able to change direction quickly, accelerate, and evade tackles to be successful in these situations.

8. Support play: Fullbacks are also expected to support their teammates in both attack and defense scenarios, providing an extra option in terms of passing, offloading, and overlapping runs.

In conclusion, the Fullback, wearing the number 15 jersey in Rugby Union, is a versatile player who contributes significantly to both offensive and defensive aspects of the game. They require a range of skills, such as strong catching, kicking, tackling, and agility, as well as decision-making abilities and a thorough knowledge of the game. The Fullback's performance can have a significant impact on the overall outcome of a match.
