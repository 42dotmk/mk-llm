Q: Musa is the class teacher of a class of 45 students. He wants to split them into three groups by age. If a third of the class is under 11 years, and two-fifths are above 11 but under 13, how many students will be in the third group (13 years and above)?
A: The first group is a third of the class which is (1 / 3) * 45 = 15 students. There are 15 students in the first group, so there are 45 - 15 = 30 students. The second group is two - fifths of the class which is (2 / 5) * 45 = 18 students. There are 18 in the second group so there are 30 - 18 = 12 students left in the third group. The answer is 12.
Question: Allen is 25 years younger than his mother. In 3 years, the sum of their ages will be 41. What is the present age of Allen's mother?
Answer: In 3 years, the sum of their present ages will be added by 3 (from Allen) + 3 (from her mother) = 6. So, the sum of their present ages is 41 - 6 = 35. Let x be the present age of Allen's mother and x - 25 be the present age of Allen. So the equation using the sum of their present ages is x + x - 25 = 35. By combining like terms, the equation becomes 2x = 60. Hence, Allen's mother is x = 60 / 2 = 30 years old now. The answer is 30.
[Question]The Dark Lord needs to transport 1200 pounds of swords to the Enchanted Forest for a battle with the elves. He has 10 squads of 8 orcs each. How many pounds of swords does each orc have to carry?
[Answer]First find how many orcs there are total by multiplying the number of orcs per squad by the number of squads: 8 orcs / squad * 10 squads = 80 orcs. Then divide the total amount of swords by the number of orcs to find the amount of swords per orc: 1200 pounds / 80 orcs = 15 pounds / orc. The answer is 15.
Q: Five people are planning a party. Sonja will buy a loaf of French bread ($3 a loaf) and a platter of cold cuts ($23). Barbara will buy the soda ($1 per person) and two boxes of crackers ($2 per box). Mario and Rick will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles ($3 per package). Danica will supply a package of paper plates for $4. How much more will Sonja spend than the rest of the office put together?
A: Sonja will spend $3 + $23 = $26. Barbara will spend 5 + ( 2 * 2) = $9. Mario and Rick will spend 2 * 3 = $6. Everyone but Sonijs spend $9 + $6 + $4 = $19. Sonija spent $26 - $19 = $7 more than the rest of the people at the party. The answer is 7.
Question: A math teacher had $100 to buy three different types of calculators. A basic calculator costs $8. A scientific calculator costs twice the price as the basic while a graphing calculator costs thrice the price as the scientific. How much change did she receive after buying those three different types of calculators?
Answer: A scientific calculator costs $8 x 2 = $16. A graphing calculator costs $16 x 3 = $48. So, she spent $8 + $16 + $48 = $72 for the three calculators. Therefore, the math teacher received $100 - $72 = $28 change. The answer is 28.
