The two questions you've asked are quite different in nature and do not hold the same meaning, but they both revolve around the theme of experiencing and expressing complicated emotions in difficult situations.

1. "I hate my dad, should I feel bad if he loses his job?"

In this question, you're expressing a negative emotion (hatred) towards your father, and you are wondering whether, despite this emotion, you should feel sympathy or concern for him if he were to lose his job. This is a complicated emotional situation, as it is possible to have negative feelings towards someone and still empathize with their struggles.

It is essential to acknowledge that your feelings are valid - if you have a difficult relationship with your father, your emotions are justified. However, feeling bad for someone who is going through a tough time doesn't necessarily mean you need to forgive them or forget about your feelings. In this situation, it might be helpful to reflect on the reasons behind your negative emotions towards your father and consider if those reasons warrant you not feeling any sympathy for him.

It is also important to remember the significance of empathy in such cases. Empathy means putting yourself in someone else's shoes and trying to understand their emotions and actions better. You might still dislike your father, but acknowledging the challenging time he may be going through if he loses his job can be beneficial for your growth and understanding of the situation.

2. "Should I contact my ex about losing his job?"

In this question, you are concerned about whether or not to reach out to an ex-partner after learning of their job loss. You mention that multiple people have suggested you check on him, but you feel it is not your responsibility anymore, as your ex-partner pushed you out of their life.

This situation is also emotionally complex. You are caught between caring for your ex's well-being and maintaining the boundaries that occurred as a result of your separation. It's normal to feel conflicted in such situations, and it's important to consider your own feelings and mental well-being when deciding whether or not to contact your ex.

You mentioned that your ex-partner pushed you out of their life, which might indicate that reaching out to them may not be well-received or positively impact your emotional state. Setting healthy boundaries in relationships, even past relationships, is necessary, and it's important to respect and nurture your well-being.

Evaluate your reasons for wanting to reach out and consider potential outcomes of the interaction. Remember that it is not selfish to prioritize your mental health and emotional well-being.

In conclusion, these two questions do not have the same meaning but are both centered around navigating complicated emotions in challenging situations. It's essential to prioritize your well-being, acknowledge your emotions, and practice empathy when navigating these scenarios. Reflect on the reasons behind your emotions, seek to understand, and then choose the most appropriate action based on your personal growth and the possible outcomes of your decisions.
