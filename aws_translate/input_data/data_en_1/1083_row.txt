[Question]A school canteen sells a sandwich at $2, a hamburger at $2, one stick of hotdog at $1, and a can of fruit juice at $2 each can. Selene buys three sandwiches and a can of fruit juice. Tanya buys two hamburgers and two cans of fruit juice. How much do Selene and Tanya spend together?
[Answer]Three sandwiches cost 3 x $2 = $6. So, Selene spends $6 + $2 = $8. Two hamburgers cost 2 x $2 = $4. Two cans of fruit juice cost 2 x $2 = $4. Thus, Tanyah spends $4 + $4 = $8. Therefore, Selene and Tanya spend $8 + $8 = $16. The answer is 16.
Q: Maggie went to Lou's aquarium and saw 100 goldfish in the aquarium. She asked if she could take some home to care for, and she was allowed to catch half of them. While using a catching net, she caught 3/5 of the total number of goldfish she was allowed to take home. How many goldfish does Maggie remain with to catch to get the total number she was allowed to take home?
A: Maggie was allowed to take half of the goldfish in the aquarium, a total of 1 / 2 * 100 = 50 goldfish. On her first catch, Maggie got 3 / 5 * 50 = 30 goldfish. To reach the number of goldfish she was allowed to take home, Maggie has to catch 50 - 30 = 20 more goldfish. The answer is 20.
Question: To improve her health, Mary decides to drink 1.5 liters of water a day as recommended by her doctor. Mary's glasses hold 250 mL of water. How many glasses of water should Mary drink per day to reach her goal?
Answer: Each liter of water holds 1000 mL. Mary's goal is to drink 1.5 liters of water a day, which in mL is 1.5 L * 1000 mL / L = 1500 mL. To reach her goal, Mary should drink 1500 mL / 250 mL / glass = 6 glasses of water per day. The answer is 6.
[Question]Allie, Rob, and Allyn each bought a bowl of grapes. Allie's bowl contained two more grapes than Rob's bowl. Allyn's bowl contained four more grapes than Allie's bowl. If Rob's bowl contained 25 grapes, what is the total combined number of grapes in all three bowls?
[Answer]If Allie's bowl contained two more grapes than Rob's bowl, there were 25 + 2 = 27 grapes in Allie's bowl. If Allyn's bowl contained four more grapes than Allie's bowl, there were 27 + 4 = 31 grapes in Allyn's bowl. The total combined number of grapes in all three bowls is 25 + 27 + 31 = 83 grapes. The answer is 83.
Q: Ravi can jump higher than anyone in the class. In fact, he can jump 1.5 times higher than the average jump of the three next highest jumpers. If the three next highest jumpers can jump 23 inches, 27 inches, and 28 inches, how high can Ravi jump?
A: The total height the next three highest can jump is 78 inches because 23 + 27 + 28 = 78. The average height they can jump is 26 inches because 78 / 3 = 26. Ravi can jump 39 inches high because 26 x 1.5 = 39. The answer is 39.
