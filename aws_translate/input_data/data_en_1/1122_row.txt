Q: Pastor Paul prays 20 times per day, except on Sunday, when he prays twice as much. Pastor Bruce prays half as much as Pastor Paul, except on Sundays, when he prays twice as much as Pastor Paul. How many more times does Pastor Paul pray than Pastor Bruce prays in a week?
A: Pastor Paul prays 20 * 6 = 120 days per week, except Sunday. On Sunday, Pastor Paul prays 2 * 20 = 40 times. Per week, Pastor Paul prays 120 + 40 = 160 times. Pastor Bruce prays half as much as Pastor Paul does on all days except Sunday, for a total of 120 / 2 = 60 times. Pastor Bruce prays twice as much on Sundays as does Pastor Paul, or 40 * 2 = 80 times. In total, Pastor Bruce prays 60 + 80 = 140 times per week. Thus, per week, Pastor Paul prays 160 - 140 = 20 more times per week than Pastor Bruce. The answer is 20.
Question: The running time of Beast of War: Armoured Command is 10 minutes longer than that of Alpha Epsilon, which is 30 minutes shorter than that of Millennium. If Millennium runs for 2 hours, what is the running time of Beast of War: Armoured Command in minutes?
Answer: One hour contains 60 minutes so 2 hours contain 60 * 2 = 120 minutes. Alpha Epsilon's running time is 30 minutes less than that of Millennium (which runs for 120 minutes) hence 120 - 30 = 90 minutes. Beast of War: Armoured Command runs for 10 minutes more than Alpha Epsilon hence 90 + 10 = 100 minutes. The answer is 100.
[Question]A luxury perfume costs $1200. The store owner decided to increase its price by 10% so that he could earn more profit. Few weeks had past but the perfume was still not sold. So, the owner decided to lower the price by 15%. By how much was the final price lower than the original price?
[Answer]There was a $1200 x 10 / 100 = $120 increase of the original price. So, the perfume was priced for $1200 + $120 = $1320. Then, 15% of the new price is $1320 x 15 / 100 = $198. So, the final price is now $1320 - $198 = $1122. Therefore, the final price is $1200 - $1122 = $78 lower than the original price. The answer is 78.
Q: A school is planning a community outreach program. Each classroom must raise $200 for this activity. Classroom A has raised $20 from each of two families, $10 from each of eight families, and $5 from each of ten families. How much more money does Classroom A need in order to reach the goal?
A: Classroom A raised 2 x $20 = $40 from two families. They raised 8 x $10 = $80 from eight families. They raised 10 x $5 = $50 from ten families. Altogether, they raised $40 + $80 + $50 = $170. Therefore, they need $200 - $170 = $30 more to reach the goal. The answer is 30.
