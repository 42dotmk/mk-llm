Q: The profit from a business transaction is shared among 2 business partners, Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5 respectively. If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?
A: According to the ratio, for every 5 parts that Johnson gets, Mike gets 2 parts. Since Johnson got $2500, each part is therefore $2500 / 5 = $500. Mike will get 2 * $500 = $1000. After buying the shirt he will have $1000 - $200 = $800 left. The answer is 800.
Question: MIlle is making snack packs for her kindergarten class. She's going to divide 64 pretzels, four times as many goldfish, and 32 suckers into baggies for the 16 kids in the class. How many items does each baggie have?
Answer: First find the total number of goldfish Millie adds: 64 pretzels * 4 goldfish / pretzel = 256 goldfish. Then add the number of each kind of snack to find the total: 256 goldfish + 64 pretzels + 32 suckers = 352 snacks. Then divide the total number of snacks by the number of baggies to find the number of snacks per baggie: 352 snacks / 16 baggies = 22 snacks / baggie. The answer is 22.
[Question]Marnie makes bead bracelets. She bought 5 bags of 50 beads and 2 bags of 100 beads. If 50 beads are used to make one bracelet, how many bracelets will Marnie be able to make out of the beads she bought?
[Answer]Marnie bought 50 x 5 = 250 beads from the 5 bags of 50 beads. She also bought 100 x 2 = 200 beads from the 2 bags of 100 beads. She has a total of 250 + 200 = 450 beads. Hence, she will be able to make 450 / 50 = 9 bracelets. The answer is 9.
Q: Mr. Grey is purchasing gifts for his family. So far he has purchased 3 polo shirts for $26 each; 2 necklaces for $83 each; and 1 computer game for $90. Since Mr. Grey purchased all those using his credit card, he received a $12 rebate. What is the total cost of the gifts after the rebate?
A: Mr. Grey paid $26 / shirt x 3 shirts = $78 on polo shirts. He paid $83 / necklace x 2 necklaces = $166 on necklaces. So, he paid $78 + $166 + $90 = $334 for the gifts. After the rebate, the total cost of the gifts is now $334 - $12 = $322. The answer is 322.
Question: In a section of the forest, there are 100 weasels and 50 rabbits. Three foxes invade this region and hunt the rodents. Each fox catches an average of 4 weasels and 2 rabbits per week. How many rabbits and weasels will be left after 3 weeks?
Answer: 3 foxes catch 4 weasels each every week for a total of 3 * 4 = 12 weasels. 12 weasels are caught every week for 3 weeks for a total of 12 * 3 = 36 weasels. 3 foxes catch 2 rabbits each every week for a total of 3 * 2 = 6 rabbits. 6 rabbits are caught every week for 3 weeks for a total of 6 * 3 = 18 rabbits. There were originally 100 weasels so now there are 100 - 36 = 64 weasels left. There were originally 50 rabbits so now there are 50 - 18 = 32 rabbits left. There are 64 + 32 = 96 weasels and rabbits left. The answer is 96.
