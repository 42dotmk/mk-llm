[Question]Rachel is 12 years old, and her grandfather is 7 times her age. Her mother is half grandfather's age, and her father is 5 years older than her mother. How old will Rachel's father be when she is 25 years old?
[Answer]Rachel's grandfather is 12 x 7 = 84 years old. Her mother is 84 / 2 = 42 years old. Her father is 42 + 5 = 47 years old. Rachel will be 25 years old in 25 - 12 = 13 years. Rachel's father will be 47 + 13 = 60 years old. The answer is 60.
Q: Hanna has $300. She wants to buy roses at $2 each and give some of the roses to her friends, Jenna and Imma. Jenna will receive 1/3 of the roses, and Imma will receive 1/2 of the roses. How many roses does Hanna give to her friends?
A: Hanna can buy $300 / $2 = 150 roses. So, Jenna will receive 1 / 3 x 150 = 50 roses. While Imma will receive 1 / 2 x 150 = 75 roses. Therefore, Hanna gives a total of 50 + 75 = 125 roses to her friends. The answer is 125.
Question: The population of an area starts at 100,000 people. It increases by 60% over 10 years due to birth. In that same time, 2000 people leave per year from emigration and 2500 people come in per year from immigration. How many people are in the area at the end of 10 years?
Answer: The population increased by 100000 * .6 = 60,000 from births. They lost 2000 * 10 = 20,000 people from emigration. They gained 2500 * 10 = 25,000 people from immigration. That means the net increase from people moving was 25000 - 20000 = 5,000. So the total population is 100,000 + 60,000 + 5,000 = 165,000. The answer is 165000.
[Question]Mr. Lalande inherited 20,000 euros from his old aunt Adeline. He is very happy because he will be able to afford the car of his dreams, a superb car worth 18000 €. He goes to the dealership and tries the car. He decides to take it, but instead of paying for everything right away, he chooses to pay in several installments. He pays 3,000 euros to be able to leave with the car and the seller offers to let him pay the rest in 6 monthly installments. How much does Mr. Lalande have to pay every month?
[Answer]Let’s first calculate what remains to be paid to Mr. Lalande once he leaves the store 18000 - 3000 = 15000£. Let’s split this sum into 6 month installments: 15000 / 6 = 2500£. The answer is 2500.
Q: Elvis is releasing a new album with 10 songs, but he doesn't want to waste too much time on writing. He spends 5 hours in the studio, where he writes, records, and edits his songs. Each song takes 12 minutes to record, then it takes 30 minutes to edit all of his songs.  How many minutes did it take Elvis to write each song, if each song took the same amount of time to write?
A: 5 hours in the studio is the same as 5 * 60 = 300 minutes. To record all of his songs, Elvis takes 12 * 10 = 120 minutes. After editing and recording 300 – 120 – 30 = 150 minutes are left to write all of his songs. Songwriting therefore took 150 / 10 = 15 minutes per song. The answer is 15.
