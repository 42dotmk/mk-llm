While these two questions may seem similar, they are actually different because they involve distinct principles of physics in separate contexts. Let's look at each question separately to explain in detail.

1. Convex lenses and the bending of light toward the principal axis:

A convex lens is a type of lens that has outward-curving surfaces and is thicker at the center than at the edges. Its ability to bend light towards the principal axis is due to the principles of refraction and lens geometry.

Refraction is the phenomenon that occurs when light passes through different media with different refractive indices, causing the light to change direction. The index of refraction is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to that in the medium. Lenses are usually made of materials with a higher refractive index than the surrounding air.

In the case of a convex lens, light enters the lens and slows down as it moves from the air to the denser medium (e.g., glass or plastic). According to Snell's Law, the angle of refraction is related to the angle of incidence, as well as the refractive indices of the two media. As the lens's surfaces curve outward, they cause the light rays to refract, and since the lens is thicker at the center, the rays entering the center part of the lens are bent more than those entering at the edge.

As a result, the refracted rays converge to a point on the principal axis. This creates a real or virtual image, depending on the position of the object relative to the lens's focal length.


2. Ball bending in cricket:

When a ball is hit towards mid-wicket and starts bending towards square-leg, or when it is hit towards cover and starts bending towards point, the effect is due to both the spin on the ball and the air resistance it encounters. These factors cause the path of the ball to curve as it travels through the air, a phenomenon known in physics as the Magnus effect.

The Magnus effect is named after the physicist Heinrich Magnus and is caused by the interaction of the spinning ball with the airflow around it. When a cricket ball is hit with a certain spin, the asymmetrical circulation of air around the ball generates a pressure difference between the side moving against the air and the side moving with the air.

For example, consider a right-handed batsman hitting the ball towards mid-wicket with a counterclockwise spin (upper side of the ball spinning forward). The spin creates a difference in air pressure, with higher pressure on the right side of the ball than on the left side. This pressure difference generates a force that pushes the ball towards square leg. The same principle applies when the ball is hit towards cover with a clockwise spin, causing it to bend towards point.

In conclusion, while both questions involve the bending of paths, they address different principles of physics. The first question pertains to refraction in a convex lens, and the second question refers to the Magnus effect influencing the path of a spinning cricket ball. Although both phenomena involve bending, they occur in separate contexts and are therefore not the same question.
