Step 1: Defining the genre and setting
To build a movie plot, we need to first determine the genre and setting for the film. Since Goldberg is known for his career in professional wrestling, the movie could be an action-thriller with elements of drama. The setting will be an urban city with a mix of gritty and luxurious landscapes.

Step 2: Establishing the main character
Bill Goldberg plays the role of Burke, a former special forces operative turned private investigator. Burke is well-built, has a strong presence, and is known for getting results in difficult cases. His military background has given him exceptional skills in hand-to-hand combat, strategy, and firearms.

Step 3: Creating the conflict
The movie's central conflict revolves around Burke being hired to investigate the disappearance of a wealthy businessman's daughter, Jessica. It is believed that she has been kidnapped, and a ransom note has been received, but the police have hit a dead end. The case calls for someone with Burke's expertise.

Step 4: Introducing the antagonist
As Burke delves deeper into the case, he discovers that the main antagonist is a powerful crime lord named Victor. Victor has strong influences within the city and has infiltrated most of its key institutions. He has a group of highly skilled mercenaries working for him that will do whatever it takes to stop Burke from rescuing Jessica and bringing Victor to justice.

Step 5: Developing the main character's relationships
During the course of the investigation, Burke teams up with Sarah, a talented but inexperienced police officer who is frustrated with her department's lack of progress in the case. They form an uneasy alliance as Sarah's knowledge of the city and its underbelly complements Burke's combat and strategic skills.

Step 6: Intensifying the conflict
As the stakes get higher and clues lead to more dangerous encounters with Victor's henchmen, Burke and Sarah face numerous obstacles. Burke becomes more invested in the case as he discovers that Jessica was not a random target; her abduction is connected to a larger conspiracy involving Victor and other powerful individuals.

Step 7: The climax
The climax of the movie features an epic showdown between Burke and Victor's chief enforcer in a tense fight scene. Using his wit, strategy, and brute strength, Burke defeats the enforcer and manages to rescue Jessica. However, Victor escapes in the chaos, leaving the possibility of a sequel.

Step 8: Resolution
In the aftermath of the rescue, Sarah is promoted within the police department due to her work on the case. Burke and Sarah develop a mutual respect and a bond between them, hinting at a possible romantic connection. With Jessica safe and the conspiracy exposed, Burke's reputation as a private investigator is solidified. He continues to work as a formidable force for justice, always ready to take on the next challenging case.

With these steps, we have created a compelling plot for a movie with Bill Goldberg playing the lead role of Burke, a tough and resourceful private investigator caught in a web of intrigue and danger in a sprawling urban city.
