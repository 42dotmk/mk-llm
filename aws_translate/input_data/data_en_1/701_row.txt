Q: Mark's basketball team scores 25 2 pointers, 8 3 pointers and 10 free throws. Their opponents score double the 2 pointers but half the 3 pointers and free throws. What's the total number of points scored by both teams added together?
A: Mark's team scores 25 2 pointers, meaning they scored 25 * 2 = 50 points in 2 pointers. His team also scores 6 3 pointers, meaning they scored 8 * 3 = 24 points in 3 pointers. They scored 10 free throws, and free throws count as one point so they scored 10 * 1 = 10 points in free throws. All together his team scored 50 + 24 + 10 = 84 points. Mark's opponents scored double his team's number of 2 pointers, meaning they scored 50 * 2 = 100 points in 2 pointers. His opponents scored half his team's number of 3 pointers, meaning they scored 24 / 2 = 12 points in 3 pointers. They also scored half Mark's team's points in free throws, meaning they scored 10 / 2 = 5 points in free throws. All together Mark's opponents scored 100 + 12 + 5 = 117 points. The total score for the game is both team's scores added together, so it is 84 + 117 = 201 points. The answer is 201.
Question: Frank goes to the store to buy some food. He buys 5 chocolate bars and 2 bags of chips. He hands the cashier $20 and gets $4 back as change. If the chocolate bars each cost $2, how much did each bag of chips cost?
Answer: His entire purchase cost $20 - $4 = $16. The chocolate bars cost 5 * $2 = $10. The bags of chips cost a total of $16 - $10 = $6. Each bag of chips cost $6 / 2 = $3. The answer is 3.
[Question]On a road map, 1/4 inch represents 8 miles of actual road distance. The towns of Pence and Hillcrest are represented by points 3 3/8 inches apart on the map. What is the actual distance, in miles, between the towns?
[Answer]If 1 / 4 inch on the map represents 8 miles on real land, 1 inch represents 4 * 8 = 32 miles. Since 1 inch represents 32 miles, 3 inches represent 3 * 32 = 96 miles. 1 / 4 inch represents 8 miles, 1 / 8 inch represents 8 / 2 = 4 miles because 1 / 8 is half of 1 / 4. If 1 / 8 inch represents 4 miles, 3 / 8 of an inch represents 3 * 4 = 12 miles. This means 3 3 / 8 inches on the map translate to 96 + 12 = 108 miles. The answer is 108.
