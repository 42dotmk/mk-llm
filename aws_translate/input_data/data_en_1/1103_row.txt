Reasoning and answer: The first station Tara stops at charges $3 for a gallon of gas, so for her 12 - gallon tank she spends 12 * 3 = 36 dollars. The second station Tara stops at charges $3.50 for a gallon of gas, so for her 12 - gallon tank she spends 12 * 3.5 = 42 dollars. The third station Tara stops at charges $4 for a gallon of gas, so for her 12 - gallon tank she spends 12 * 4 = 48 dollars. The fourth station Tara stops at charges $4.50 for a gallon of gas, so for her 12 - gallon tank she spends 12 * 4.5 = 54 dollars. Now that we know all the individual amounts, we add 36 + 42 + 48 + 54 = 180 dollars in gas in total.
The answer: 180

Luke takes 5 * 120 = 600 grape jelly beans, five times the vanilla jelly beans there are?. Luke's total number of grape jelly beans is fifty more than five times the number of vanilla jelly beans, a total of 600 + 50 = 650. In total, there are 650 + 120 = 770 jelly beans.
The answer: 770
Reverse engineering the question: Luke takes fifty more than five times as many grape jelly beans as vanilla jelly beans. If there are 120 vanilla jelly beans, how many jelly beans are there in total?

Reasoning and answer: Mary ran 3 / 8 x 24 = 9 kilometers. Edna ran 2 / 3 x 9 = 6 kilometers. Lucy ran 5 / 6 x 6 = 5 kilometers. Lucy should run 9 - 5 = 4 kilometers more.

The rares cost 19 * 1 = $19. The uncommon cards cost 11 * .5 = $5.5. The commons cost 30 * .25 = $7.5. So the total cost 19 + 5.5 + 7.5 = $32.
The answer: 32

Reasoning and answer: Let x be the score that William needs to achieve. Since there are 30 people in the class, there are 30 - 1 = 29 people without him. Since their average was a 74%, this means that (29 * 74 + x) / 30 > = 75. Thus, 29 * 74 + x > = 30 * 75. Thus, 29 * 74 + x > = 2250. Thus, 2146 + x > = 2250. Thus, x > = 2250 - 2146. Thus, x > = 94.
The answer: 94
