Step 1: Establish the setting and main characters

First, we need to establish the setting for our movie plot. Let's choose a small, secluded village surrounded by dense forests as our primary location. The residents of this village have lived there for centuries, keeping their traditions and beliefs intact. Among them, the Vagyu clan is a mysterious and feared community known for practicing black magic.

Our main character, Alex, is an outsider who moves to the village to start a new life after going through a personal tragedy. Unaware of the Vagyu clan's existence and their dark arts, Alex befriends another villager, Sara, who shares stories and warnings about the Vagyu clan.

Step 2: Introduce the conflict

The movie plot thickens as the village experiences a series of mysterious events, from unexplained sicknesses to terrible accidents. Suspicion falls upon the Vagyu clan as the village starts to believe that they're responsible for the misfortunes, using their black magic to maintain control and fear.

Alex, driven by curiosity and a desire to expose the truth, decides to investigate the Vagyu clan further. With Sara's help, they gather information and uncover secrets about the clan's dark rituals.

Step 3: Raise the stakes

As Alex and Sara delve deeper into the Vagyu clan's activities, they start to become the targets of the clan's wrath. Paranormal events start occurring around them, and they feel an ominous presence following their every move.

Despite the dangers, Alex and Sara resolve to confront the Vagyu clan and put an end to their dark practices once and for all. However, they're met with resistance not only from the clan but also from some villagers who are afraid of the repercussions of challenging the Vagyu.

Step 4: Climax and resolution

In the climax, Alex and Sara discover the Vagyu clan's hidden lair where they perform their rituals. They manage to interrupt a significant ritual, causing a massive display of dark energies that wreak havoc on the village.

The Vagyu clan's leader, infuriated by Alex and Sara's interference, vows to use the full extent of their black magic to make them suffer. In the heat of the moment, Sara reveals her hidden knowledge of white magic and engages in a fierce magical battle with the Vagyu leader. While the duel rages, Alex works to undo the dark spells cast on the village, resulting in a gradual lift of the curse plaguing the community.

Finally, Sara defeats the Vagyu leader, and the clan's power wanes. The villagers, now free from fear, work together to rebuild their community and shun the darkness that once loomed over them.

Step 5: End the movie plot on a hopeful note

The movie closes with Alex deciding to remain in the village, having found a sense of purpose and belonging. Alex's bond with Sara strengthens as they continue to use their knowledge of magic to help the community. Together, they ensure that the village remains protected from any future dark forces.

Thus, the answer to the question, "What type of magic do the Vagyu clan practice?" is black magic, which is central to the conflict and resolution of the movie plot.
