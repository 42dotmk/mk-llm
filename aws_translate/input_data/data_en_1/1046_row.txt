[Answer]Dany has to have 4 x 2 = 8 bushels a day for the cows. He has to have 3 x 2 = 6 bushels a day for the sheep. And he also has to have 7 x 3 = 21 bushels a day for the chickens. Therefore, Dany has to have 8 + 6 + 21 = 35 bushels to suffice the animals for a day. The answer is 35.
Q: A school has 100 students. Half of the students are girls, the other half are boys. 20% of the girls have dogs at home and 10% of the boys have dogs at home. How many students own dogs?
A: Out of 100 students, half are girls and half are boys so there are 100 / 2 = 50 girls. There are 50 girls out of 100 students means there are 100 - 50 = 50 boys. 20% of the 50 girls have dogs so they have .20 * 50 = 10 dogs. 10% of the 50 boys have dogs so they have .10 * 50 = 5 dogs. The girls have 10 dogs and the boys have 5 dogs so together, they have 10 + 5 = 15 dogs. The answer is 15.
Question: Robby, Jaylen and Miranda are employed at a Cheesecake factory, earning $10 per hour. They work 10 hours a day, five days a week. Robby saves 2/5 of his salary, Jaylene saves 3/5 of his salary, while Miranda saves half of her salary. What are the combined savings of the three employees after four weeks?
Answer: In a day, each of them earns $10 / hour * 10 hours / day = $100 / day. The total number of days each of them work in a month is five days per week * 4 weeks = 20 days. If each of them earns $100 per day, in 20 days, they'll earn 20 days / month * $100 / day = $2000 / month. Robby saves 2 / 5 * $2000 = $800 from his salary. Jaylene's savings is 3 / 5 * $2000 = $1200 of her salary. Miranda saves 1 / 2 * $2000 = $1000 from her salary. The total saving for the three employees is $1000 + $1200 + $800 = $3000. The answer is 3000.

Q: A class has 60 students. The number of students who bring their lunch is thrice the number of those who eat in the school cafeteria. The rest of the students don't eat lunch. If 10 students eat in the school cafeteria, how many don't eat lunch?
A: Multiplying the number of students eating at the cafeteria by three means that 3 * 10 = 30 students bring lunch. The total number of students that eat lunch is 10 + 30 = 40 students. Since the class has 60 students, those who don't eat lunch are 60 - 40 = 20 students. The answer is 20.
