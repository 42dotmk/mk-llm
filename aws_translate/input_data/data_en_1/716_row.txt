The patterns or designs applied to the hands of Indian women using Henna are called Mehndi or Henna art. Mehndi is a traditional Indian art form that involves creating intricate, decorative designs on the hands, feet, and other parts of the body using a Henna paste. This art form has been practiced for centuries as a part of Indian and South Asian culture and continues to be popular in various events and celebrations, particularly weddings and traditional festivals. 

There are several different styles and patterns of Mehndi designs prevalent in India, each with its unique cultural significance and regional variations. Some of the most popular styles of Mehndi patterns for Indian women include:

1. Indian Mehndi Designs: Indian Mehndi designs are known for their intricate detailing and dense patterns. These designs include traditional motifs like flowers, peacocks, paisleys, and more, often combined to form elaborate patterns. Indian Mehndi designs often cover the entire hand and can even extend up to the wrists and forearms, depending on the occasion.

2. Arabic Mehndi Designs: Arabic Mehndi designs are also popular among Indian women. These designs are characterized by their bold and large floral patterns with vines or leaves connecting the main elements. Arabic Mehndi designs are less dense compared to Indian designs and typically leave more open spaces. This style gives a more modern and minimalistic look, perfect for those who prefer something less ornate.

3. Moroccan Mehndi Designs: Moroccan Mehndi designs are inspired by the geometric patterns and architecture found in the Arab world. The designs feature crisp lines, angles, and straight shapes, creating unique patterns that differ from the highly curved and flowing patterns found in other Mehndi designs. This style gives a fresh and elegant look, perfect for those who appreciate simplicity and clean designs.

4. Rajasthani Mehndi Designs: Rajasthani Mehndi designs are influenced by the rich and colorful culture of the Indian state of Rajasthan. These designs incorporate traditional motifs like peacocks, lotus flowers, and royal embellishments. Rajasthani Mehndi patterns often cover the entire hand and feature intricate designs that showcase the wearer's skill and creativity.

5. Indo-Western Fusion Mehndi Designs: Due to the increasing popularity of Mehndi across the globe, a fusion of Indian and Western patterns has emerged called Indo-Western fusion mehndi designs. These designs combine the intricate detailing of Indian designs with the more minimalistic and modern touches of Western patterns, creating a perfect balance between tradition and contemporary aesthetics.

Henna art, or Mehndi, is not only a symbol of beauty but also carries various cultural and religious connotations. For Indian women, Mehndi designs are an essential part of their celebratory attire during festivals like Diwali, Karva Chauth, and Teej, as well as life events like marriages and engagements. The intricacy and depth of Mehndi patterns reflect the dedication and skill of the artist, as well as the wearer's appreciation for their cultural heritage.
