Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat from New York, is vocally addressing the issue of sexual assault and harassment within the halls of the U.S. Capitol. In an appearance on "CBS This Morning," she described the current system for reporting such incidents as "opaque" and "difficult to navigate." 

To expose the true extent of the issue and provide better support for victims, Gillibrand and Rep. Jackie Speier of California have introduced the "Me Too Congress Act." This bill is designed to make the reporting process more transparent and accountable, allowing employees of Congress to complete a survey regarding workplace safety and eliminating mandatory non-disclosure agreements for survivors of sexual assault.

Importantly, the proposed legislation also stipulates that members of Congress are required to repay any settlements related to discrimination cases. It also gives victims a choice whether or not to make their incident public, an option that is currently denied to them due to required non-disclosure agreements.

She described House Speaker Paul Ryan's alternative bill as 'not strong enough,' as it focuses only on providing training. Gillibrand argues that systematic alterations must be made to enable justice for the victims.

Gillibrand maintains that the decision to publicly reveal the names of the accused should remain the prerogative of the survivors. She acknowledged the potential retaliation and personal turmoil that public attention could inflict upon survivors, especially those working within politics. 

Amid the backdrop of her activism against sexual misconduct, Gillibrand has also been vociferous in her critique of Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, who has faced a slew of sexual misconduct allegations. She avowed that if Moore were elected, she would vote against his seating. 

In addition to her work in Congress, Gillibrand has been active in pushing legislation outside Capitol Hill. She is lobbying for military prosecutors to have the authority to decide which sexual assault cases are trialed, thus encouraging more individuals to report crimes without fearing backlash.

Gillibrand's actions against sexual misconduct are part of an overall commitment to supporting fellow women in politics. For instance, she was an early advocate for Hillary Clinton's 2016 Presidential campaign, dedicating numerous hours to fundraising for Democratic women candidates.

This stand against sexual harassment and misconduct aligns with a broader societal shift. High-profile individuals across multiple sectors, including media, entertainment, and politics, face allegations of misconduct, sparking a significant reevaluation of workplace dynamics and power disparities. Notably, even former President Bill Clinton's behavior during the Monica Lewinsky scandal is being questioned in light of these recent developments.

In summary, Gillibrand is at the forefront of a sustained effort to challenge a deeply entrenched culture of sexual misconduct, both in Congress and wider society. This includes presenting new legislation, critiquing fellow politicians, and advocating for women in every area of her political life.
