Step 1: Establish the main characters

In order to create a movie plot around "Who is sacrificed by Pang? Zhao," we first need to establish our main characters. In this case, we have two characters, Pang and Zhao. We can further develop these characters by giving them a backstory, personality traits, and motivations.

Pang: A cunning and ambitious individual who will do anything to achieve power and success. Pang comes from a lower-class background and has always felt the need to prove himself. He is manipulative and sees people as pawns in his grand schemes.

Zhao: A loyal and trustworthy friend, Zhao is the complete opposite of Pang. Kind-hearted and genuine, Zhao has always believed in the power of friendship and trust. He is intelligent and quick-witted but prefers to use his skills for the greater good rather than for personal gain.

Step 2: Determine the setting

The setting for our movie plot could be a sprawling, ancient kingdom filled with political intrigue, betrayals, and power struggles. This helps create an environment where our characters' motivations and actions can flourish as well as create tension in the narrative.

Step 3: Outline the main events

1. Introduction: The movie starts by presenting the friendship and bond between Pang and Zhao as they grow up together in the kingdom. They both dream of rising through the ranks and making a difference in the kingdom.

2. Rising Tension: As they grow older, their paths diverge. Pang increasingly focuses on using any means necessary to gain power, while Zhao remains true to his beliefs in loyalty and trust. This tension grows as they both secure positions within the kingdom's political system.

3. The Sacrifice: In order to secure a powerful alliance and discredit potential threats to his position, Pang concocts a plot to frame Zhao for treason, setting him up as the sacrificial pawn. He manipulates events so that Zhao is accused, tried, and sentenced to death.

4. The Aftermath: Following Zhao's death, Pang achieves his goal of obtaining a position of great power in the kingdom. However, his guilt over sacrificing his once best friend begins to eat away at him. He starts to question whether obtaining power was truly worth the cost. And ultimately his ambition leads to his own downfall.

Step 4: The climax and conclusion

1. Climax: Pang's position of power leads him to face grave challenges from within and outside the kingdom. His enemies use his past actions against him and expose the truth about his betrayal and sacrifice of Zhao. A revolt starts, and Pang loses everything he's built.

2. Conclusion: The kingdom is ultimately saved by a new leader, one who embodies Zhao's ideals of loyalty, trust, and selflessness. Pang, now a broken man, is left reflecting on the price of his ambition and how his greed led to his own destruction.

By following these steps, we have built a movie plot around the question, "Who is sacrificed by Pang? Zhao." The story focuses on themes of betrayal, ambition, loyalty, and the consequences of one's actions, with a tragic ending that highlights the importance of staying true to one's beliefs and values.
