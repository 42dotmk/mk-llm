Until the pond was full.

While the afternoon sun cast its golden rays upon the vivid flora of the garden, the gardener trudged along a meandering footpath, diligently pushing his rickety wooden cart. The wheels creaked, bearing the weight of the water barrels nestled comfortably within. Weary yet resolute, he wiped the sweat from his brow, determined to complete the task at hand.

The garden, a true masterpiece of nature, was a labor of love for the humble gardener. Its variety of flowers, from elegant roses to whimsical daffodils, lent their colors to the landscape, gently painting it with life. Ornately carved hedges danced in the subtle breeze, their delicate green details evoking a symphony of shapes. Majestic trees, some towering tall while others gracefully curved, provided a serenade of leaves as their branches swayed above.

At the heart of this Eden, a serene pond awaited the gardener's attention. Its tranquil waters, teeming with fish of every hue, served as an oasis for his hardworking hours, offering relief and solace. On this particular day, the pond had started to decline, its water levels having dipped slightly due to gradual evaporation and thirsty creatures who ventured close to drink. Aware that the pond's inhabitants and surrounding flora relied on its nourishing waters, the gardener saw it as his duty to refill the gem of his garden.

As he approached the pond, his hands steadied the cart's wooden frame, careful not to spill a single drop. One by one, he stretched his sinewy arms, grasping the barrels with vigor and pouring their contents into the waiting pond. The water splashed gently upon the surface, merging with the shimmering hues of reds, blues, and yellows reflected on the watery canvas.

He watched as the water level slowly began to rise, revitalizing the pond's ecosystem. A school of fishes near the edge darted into deeper waters, their scales sparkling like tiny prisms in the sunlight. Dragonflies zipped about, skimming the water's surface as their wings caught wind, seeking out newfound hideaways amongst the reeds. Even the chorus of frogs, once silenced by the vanishing water, serenaded the gardener with excitable croaks, grateful for the restored depth.

As the gardener emptied the final barrel, the water in the pond reached its usual level. His eyes scanned the fullness of the pond, a gratified smile gracing his weary face. The garden had once again returned to its harmonious balance, a vibrant symphony of colors, sounds, and life. Knowing his task had been accomplished, the gardener took a moment to savor the view, allowing the satisfaction from a job well done to wash over him.

With renewed determination, he pushed the now-empty cart away from the pond, already planning his next gardening endeavor. As the sun dipped lower in the sky, the gardener continued to tend to his beloved creation, ensuring the beauty and health of the garden was safeguarded for both current and future generations to enjoy. For the gardener knew that his work was not just a responsibility, but a calling, fulfilling his soul and breathing life into his small piece of paradise.
