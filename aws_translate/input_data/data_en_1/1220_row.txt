Question: In a car racing competition, Skye drove a 6-kilometer track. For the first 3 kilometers, his speed was 150 kilometers per hour. For the next 2 kilometers, his speed was 50 kilometers per hour more. For the remaining 1 kilometer, his speed was twice as fast as his speed on the first 3 kilometers. What is Skye's average speed for the entire race?
Answer: Since time is obtained by dividing distance and speed, then Skye took 3 km / 150 km per hr. = 1 / 50 of an hour to finish the first 3 kilometers of the race. His speed on the next 2 kilometers was 150 + 50 = 200 kilometers per hour. Hence, it took him 2 km / 200 km per hr. = 1 / 100 of an hour to finish the next 2 kilometers. His speed on the remaining 1 kilometer is 150 x 2 = 300 kilometers per hour. Hence, it took him 1 / 300 of an hour to finish the 1 kilometer. So, the total time it took for Skye to complete the race was 1 / 50 + 1 / 100 + 1 / 300 = 1 / 30 of an hour. Therefore, his average speed for the entire race was 6 km / 1 / 30 hour = 180 kilometers per hour. The answer is 180.
[Question]Gerald spends $100 a month on baseball supplies. His season is 4 months long. He wants to use the months he's not playing baseball to save up by raking, shoveling, and mowing lawns. He charges $10 for each. How many chores does he need to average a month to save up for his supplies?
[Answer]He needs to save up $400 because 4 x 100 = 400. He has 8 months to earn this money because 12 - 4 = 8. He needs to earn $50 a month because 400 / 8 = 50. He needs to do 5 tasks a month because 50 / 10 = 5. The answer is 5.
Q: 6 kids in Carolyn's daycare prefer peas, 9 prefer carrots, and 5 prefer corn. What percentage of the children prefer corn?
A: First find the total number of children: 6 kids + 9 kids + 5 kids = 20 kids. Then divide the number of kids who prefer corn by the total number of kids and multiply by 100% to express as a percentage: 5 kids / 20 kids * 100% = 25%. The answer is 25.
Question: Maria is chopping up vegetables for a stew. She wants to cut up six times as many carrots as potatoes, twice as many onions as carrots, and 1/3 as many green beans as onions. If she has two potatoes, how many green beans does she need to cut?
Answer: First find how many carrots Maria needs to cut by multiplying the number of potatoes by 6: 6 * 2 = 12. Then find how many onions she needs by multiplying the number of carrots by 2: 12 * 2 = 24. Finally, divide the number of onions by 3 to find the number of green beans she needs 24 / 3 = 8. The answer is 8.
