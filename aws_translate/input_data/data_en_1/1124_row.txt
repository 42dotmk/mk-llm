Before Hannah asked Lee for a recommendation letter for nursing school, she would have needed to complete several essential steps to ensure she was prepared and could present herself as a strong candidate. These steps include:

1. Researching nursing programs: Hannah must have researched various nursing schools and programs to find those that align with her career goals, interests, and qualifications. This would have involved assessing the curriculum, location, cost, accreditation, and reputation of each program.

2. Meeting prerequisite requirements: Each nursing school has specific prerequisites that applicants must meet before applying, such as courses in anatomy, physiology, chemistry, and microbiology. Hannah would have needed to ensure she completed these courses and maintained a competitive grade point average.

3. Gaining relevant experience: Nursing schools often look for candidates with some hands-on experience in the medical field. Hannah may have obtained experience by volunteering, working as a certified nursing assistant (CNA) or as a patient care technician.

4. Preparing for and taking entrance exams: Competitive nursing schools often require applicants to take entrance exams such as the Test of Essential Academic Skills (TEAS) or the Health Education Systems, Inc. (HESI) Admission Assessment Exam. Hannah would have needed to study for and complete one of these exams, achieving a competitive score.

5. Creating a strong application: Nursing schools typically require students to submit transcripts, test scores, and other materials along with their application. Hannah would have needed to gather these documents and ensure her application showcased her accomplishments and reasons for pursuing a nursing career.

6. Writing a personal statement: A well-written personal statement is a crucial component of a competitive nursing school application. Hannah would have had to craft a compelling personal statement that shared her motivations, goals, experiences, and passion for nursing.

7. Identifying potential recommenders: When selecting recommenders, it's essential to choose individuals who can speak to the candidate's skills, experiences, and qualities. In Hannah's case, she identified Lee as someone who could provide a strong and impactful recommendation letter.

8. Contacting recommenders: Once she had selected her recommenders, Hannah would have reached out to them, providing them with relevant information about the nursing programs she was applying to. This may have included a timeline for when the recommendation letter was due and guidance on what points to address in the letter.

9. Following up with recommenders: To ensure that her recommenders submit their letters on time, Hannah would have followed up with them regularly, offering to provide any additional information and politely reminding them of the deadline.

By completing these steps, Hannah would have been well-prepared to ask Lee for a recommendation letter. Following this, she could confidently submit her nursing school applications, knowing that she had done everything possible to present herself as a strong candidate for admission.
