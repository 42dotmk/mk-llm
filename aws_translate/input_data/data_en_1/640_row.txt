[Question]Mary is going on a business trip. It takes 10 minutes for her Uber to get to her house and 5 times longer to get to the airport. It takes 15 minutes to check her bag and three times as long to get through security. Then she has to wait for 20 minutes for her flight to start boarding and twice as long before the plane is ready to take off. How many hours will this process take total?
[Answer]First find the time to drive to the airport: 10 minutes * 5 = 50 minutes. Then find the time it takes to get through security: 15 minutes * 3 = 45 minutes. Then find the time Mary spends waiting for the plane to take off: 20 minutes * 2 = 40 minutes. Then add the time to each step to find the total time: 10 minutes + 50 minutes + 15 minutes + 45 minutes + 20 minutes + 40 minutes = 180 minutes. Then divide that amount by the number of minutes per hour to cover the total time to hours: 180 minutes / 60 minutes / hour = 3 hours. The answer is 3.
Q: Greg bought a 20-pack of granola bars to eat at lunch for the week. He set aside one for each day of the week, traded three of the remaining bars to his friend Pete for a soda, and gave the rest to his two sisters. How many did each sister get when they split them evenly?
A: Greg kept 1 granola bar for each of the 7 days of the week, so there were 20 - 7 = 13 bars left. He traded 3 to his friend Pete, so there were 13 - 3 = 10 bars left. His 2 sisters split the rest evenly, so each got 10 / 2 = 5 granola bars. The answer is 5.
Question: Carlson bought land that cost $8000 and additional land that cost $4000. He initially owned 300 square meters of land. If the land he bought costs $20 per square meter, how big is his land after buying the new land?
Answer: Carlson bought land that cost $20 per square meter, therefore the size of the land he bought is 8000 / 20 = 400. And the size of the other land he bought is 4000 / 20 = 200. Therefore the total size of the land he owns is 400 + 200 + 300 = 900. The answer is 900.
[Question]The cost of building a certain house in an area is 100,000 more than the construction cost of each of the houses in the area. But it sells for 1.5 times as much as the other houses, which sell at $320,000 each. How much more profit is made by spending the extra money to build?
[Answer]The house cost 320,000 * 1.5 = $480,000. So it is worth 480,000 - 320,000 = $160,000 more than other houses. So the profit is 160,000 - 100,000 = $60,000 more. The answer is 60000.
