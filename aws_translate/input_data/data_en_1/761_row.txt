Q: Candace is trying to decide whether to wear her old shoes or new high-tech shoes for a hike. The high-tech shoes will help Candace walk twice as fast, but they're not broken in yet, so she'll get 1 blister after every 2 hours she spends walking in them. Each blister slows Candance down by 2 miles per hour. If Candance walks 6 miles per hour in the old shoes and plans to hike for 4 hours, how many miles per hour can she go in the new shoes?
A: Wearing the high - tech shoes, Candace can hike 6 mph * 2 = 12 mph for the first two hours. Then she gets one blister, so her speed drops to 12 mph - 2 mph = 10 mph for the next two hours of the hike. After that time Candace gets another blister, but 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours, so the hike is over and we don't care about her speed anymore. Candace spends an equal amount of time walking at 12 mph and 10 mph, so we can average the two speeds to find an overall speed of (12 mph + 10 mph) / 2 = 11 mph. The answer is 11.
Question: The Zargon Destroyer spacecraft can travel at 2 billion miles per hour in normal space, but when moving through a black hole they travel three times faster. If the Zargon Destroyer is making a voyage that travels seven hours in normal space and two hours through a black hole, how many billions of miles would they have traveled?
Answer: A spacecraft flying through normal space for seven hours at 2 - billion miles per hour travels 7 * 2 = 14 billion miles. A spacecraft flying through a black hole at 3 * 2 = 6 billion miles per hour. Thus, a spacecraft flying through a black hole for two hours travels 2 * 6 = 12 billion miles. Therefore, in total, the Zargon spacecraft will travel 14 + 12 = 26 billion miles. The answer is 26.
[Question]Tim drinks 2 bottles that are each 1.5 quarts and an additional 20 ounces a day. How much water does he drink a week?
[Answer]The bottles are 1.5 * 32 = 48 ounces. So he drinks 48 * 2 = 96 ounces from the bottles. So in total he drank 96 + 20 = 116 ounces a day. 116 * 7 = 812 ounces a week. The answer is 812.
Q: Carrie is trying to sneak some mashed turnips into her kids' mashed potatoes. She knows they didn't notice when she mixed 2 cups of turnips with 5 cups of potatoes. If she has 20 cups of potatoes, how many cups of turnips can she add?
A: First find the number of cups of potatoes Carrie adds per one cup of turnips: 5 cups potatoes / 2 cups turnips = 2.5 cups potatoes / cup turnips. Then divide the number of cups of potatoes she has that that ratio to find the number of cups of turnips she adds: 20 cups potatoes / 2.5 cups potatoes / cup turnips = 8 cups turnips. The answer is 8.
Question: James decides to bulk up. He weighs 120 kg and gains 20% of his body weight in muscle and 1 quarter that much in fat. How much does he weigh now?
Answer: He gains 120 * .2 = 24 kg in muscles. So he gains 24 / 4 = 6 kg of fat. That means he gains a total of 24 + 6 = 30 kg of bodyweight. So his new body weight is 120 + 30 = 150 kg. The answer is 150.
