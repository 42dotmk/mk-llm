After one year he earns $200 in interest because 1,000 x .2 = 200. After one year it has $1,200 in the account because 1,000 + 200 = 1,200. He takes out $600 because 1,200 / 2 = 600. After this it has $600 in it because 1,200 - 600 = 600. She earns $90 in interest because 600 x .15 = 90. The account now has $690 because 600 + 90 = 690.
The answer: 690

Reasoning and answer: Coach A spent $29x 10 = $290 for the 10 basketballs. Coach B spent $2.50x14 = $35 for the 14 baseballs. So, Coach B spent a total of $35 + $18 = $53 for the baseballs and a bat. Thus, Coach A spent $290 - $53 = $237 more than coach B.
The answer: 237

For half of the cupcakes, Stephanie wants to use 1 candle each. Since half of the cupcakes is 24 / 2 and she plans to use 1 candle each for this half of the cupcakes, Stephanie needs (24 / 2) * 1 = 12 candles for this half of the cupcakes. For the other half of the cupcakes, Stephanie wants to use 2 candles. Therefore, she will need (24 / 2) * 2 = 24 candles for this half of the cupcakes. Because Stephanie needs 12 candles for half of the cupcakes and 24 candles for the other half, she needs a total of 12 + 24 = 36 candles. Since Stephanie needs 36 candles to decorate all the cupcakes and she currently has 30 candles, Stephanie needs 36 - 30 = 6 additional candles.
The answer: 6
