Question: Five food companies sponsored a local food bank. Foster Farms donated 45 dressed chickens; American Summits donated twice the number of bottled water than the number of dressed chicken donated by Foster Farms; Hormel donated three times the number of dressed chickens that Foster Farms donated; Boudin Butchers donated one-third of the number of dressed chickens that Hormel donated; Del Monte Foods donated 30 fewer bottles of water than American Summits. How many food items did the companies donate in total?
Answer: American Summits donated 45 x 2 = 90 bottled waters. Hormel donated 45 x 3 = 135 spams. Boudin Bakery donated 135 x 1 / 3 = 45 sourdoughs. Del Monte Foods donated 90 - 30 = 60 canned fruits. Therefore, a total of 45 + 90 + 135 + 45 + 60 = 375 different food. The answer is 375.
[Question]Rudy runs 5 miles at a rate of 10 minutes per mile. Later he runs 4 miles at a rate of 9.5 minutes per mile. What is the total length of time that Rudy runs?

Q: Faith's neighborhood, with a total of 20 homes, decided to install solar panels. Each home needed 10 panels capable of providing their power needs. The supplier of the panels brought 50 panels less than the required amount. The neighbors agreed to only install the panels up to where they'd be finished. How many homes had their panels installed?
A: The total number of panels required is 20 * 10 = 200 panels. When 50 failed to be delivered, the total number available for use became 200 - 50 = 150 panels. If each home requires 10 panels, the number of homes that had panels installed is 150 / 10 = 15 homes. The answer is 15.
Question: Edmund is buying a new computer and needs to save up $75 before he has enough. He convinces his parents to pay him for extra chores. He normally has to do 12 chores a week. His parents agree to pay him $2 for every extra chore he does during the week. If he does 4 chores a day for two weeks, how much does he earn?
Answer: In two weeks, he has to do 24 chores because 2 x 12 = 24. He now does 28 chores a week because 7 x 4 = 28. He does 56 chores in two weeks because 2 x 28 = 56. He has done 32 extra chores because 56 - 24 = 32. He earns $64 because 2 x 32 = 64. The answer is 64.
[Question]The price of a math textbook in the school bookshop is $45. If those sold in bookshops outside the school cost 20% less, how much can Peter save by buying from other bookshops rather than the school's if he wants to buy 3 math textbooks?
[Answer]20% of $45 is (20 / 100) * $45 = $9. The price of the textbook in other bookshops cost $9 less than $45 which is $45 - $9 = $36. Three textbooks from the school bookshop would cost $45 * 3 = $135. Three textbooks from another bookshop would cost $36 * 3 = $108. Peter can save $135 - $108 = $27 by buying from another bookshop. The answer is 27.
