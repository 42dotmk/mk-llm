In English:

Dear Mr. Speaker, I voted in favor of this resolution, which is titled "Sudan and South Sudan: The Situation After the 2011 Referendum".

This resolution addresses the ongoing political and humanitarian challenges faced by both Sudan and South Sudan following their separation in 2011 as a result of a referendum. The decision to create an independent South Sudan was supported by a majority of 98.83%, which was widely expected due to the long-standing ethnic, cultural, and political divides between the north and south of the country.

Since the secession of South Sudan, both countries have faced significant challenges in terms of political stability, economic development, and security. In particular, the relationship between the two countries has been fraught with tension, and there have been numerous incidents of armed conflict along their shared border. Both nations have struggled with internal strife as well, with various rebel groups, militias, and local grievances leading to outbreaks of violence and episodes of civil unrest.

The resolution seeks to address the critical challenges faced by Sudan and South Sudan by advocating for increased international efforts to support the peace and stability of the region. Some of the key points raised in this resolution include:

1. Encouraging both the governments of Sudan and South Sudan to reach diplomatic agreements on the remaining outstanding issues, such as border demarcation, the status of Abyei, and the sharing of resources, particularly oil revenues.

2. Supporting the ongoing peace talks and the implementation of peace agreements, such as the 2015 Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan (ARCSS) and the 2019 Juba Peace Agreement. 

3. Calling for a renewed commitment from international partners and donors to provide humanitarian assistance and development aid to both countries to help alleviate the suffering of their respective civilian populations and contribute to long-term stability and development.

4. Urging the governments of Sudan and South Sudan to respect and uphold human rights, democratic principles, and the rule of law, and to combat impunity for war crimes and other serious human rights abuses.

5. Encouraging regional and international cooperation to address cross-border challenges, such as the influx of refugees, human trafficking, and transnational organized crime.

In conclusion, by voting in favor of this resolution, I believe that the international community must recognize the critical challenges faced by both Sudan and South Sudan and prioritize efforts towards promoting peace, stability, and development in the region. This includes supporting diplomatic initiatives between the two countries, as well as providing assistance in humanitarian aid and development programs. It is my hope that with continued international support and engagement, both countries can overcome their challenges, and ultimately, their peoples can enjoy the security, dignity, and prosperity they deserve.
