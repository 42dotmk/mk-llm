Title: The Agreement

Genre: Romantic Drama

Setting: A modern-day small town

Plot Summary: Veda, a young, intelligent, and strong-spirited woman, finds herself stuck in an unhappy and suffocating marriage. With no family to turn to, she debates her future, wanting to break free from her controlling husband. She crosses paths with Wally and Mildred, an eccentric yet empathetic couple who can understand her struggles. The trio embarks on a rollercoaster journey of emotion, conspiracy, and self-discovery to help Veda escape her marriage and regain control of her life.

Act 1:
Veda Wharton, a talented artist, marries Jacob Carter, a wealthy and possessive businessman. Her dreams are shattered when she realizes how emotionally abusive and manipulative her husband is. Desperate for support and a way out, Veda's path crosses with Wally and Mildred, an older couple who own a quaint antique store in town. Wally, a retired detective, and Mildred, a wise and warm-hearted woman, recognize Veda's suffering and agree to help her escape her marriage.

Act 2: 
Wally and Mildred devise a detailed plan to help Veda collect evidence of Jacob's abusive behavior, ensuring she receives legal protection and a fair divorce settlement. Veda begins discretely documenting the abuse with photographs, voice recordings, and written accounts of her day-to-day experiences. Meanwhile, Wally uses his connections to find others who have been wronged by Jacob and wishes to testify against him. 

As the trio works together, Veda forges a life-changing bond with Wally and Mildred. They impart wisdom, open her eyes to her true worth, and become the parental figures Veda never had. Veda's artistic talent flourishes in their presence, and she uses her art to express her emotions and cope with her fear.

Act 3: 
Mildred suggests that they inform the authorities and let the legal system handle the situation. Wally hesitates, fearing something might go wrong, but ultimately agrees that it is the safest route. Unexpectedly, Jacob discovers Veda's stash of evidence and confronts her with the intention of punishing her. However, in this climactic scene, Veda's newfound strength and the support of Wally and Mildred finally enable her to stand up to Jacob. Filled with courage, Veda calls the police and have her husband arrested. Her myriad of evidence reveals not only the abuse she suffered but also a series of financial crimes committed by her husband.

Epilogue:
After a lengthy, intense trial, Jacob is both convicted for his financial crimes and forced to comply with Veda's conditions for a divorce. Veda has successfully escaped her marriage and regained control of her life. The friendship and bond formed with Wally and Mildred grow even stronger.

In the end, Veda, no longer suppressed under the weight of her abusive marriage, stands tall with Wally and Mildred by her side. The film closes as she opens her own art gallery and begins a new, fulfilling chapter of her life, unafraid and unhindered by her past. The Agreement is a poignant tale of perseverance, the power of friendship, and the courage of a woman discovering her inner worth.
