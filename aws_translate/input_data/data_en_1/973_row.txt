Maine, because it is the only state among the given options that has direct access to the Atlantic Ocean, where lobsters are abundantly found. Maine is well-known for its lobster industry, providing not only the local area but also other states and countries with fresh lobsters. The coastal waters off the coast of Maine are considered to be among the most productive lobster grounds in the world. In fact, Maine's coastal region supplies more than 80% of the United States' lobster catch.

The state's geographic location, climate, and ecosystem create the perfect environment for lobsters to thrive. Maine's coastal waters contain a high concentration of phytoplankton, which serves as the primary food source for lobsters. The temperature of the water around Maine is also ideal for lobsters, as they prefer colder water temperatures ranging between 40-50Â°F.

There are several reasons why Maine's lobster industry is so successful and why steakhouses in Maine can offer fresh-caught lobster:

1. Proximity to the coast: With thousands of miles of coastline, Maine has ample access to lobster fishing areas. This makes it easy for fishermen and suppliers to quickly and efficiently catch, process, and deliver fresh lobsters to steakhouses in the state.

2. Sustainable fishing practices: The state of Maine is committed to maintaining a healthy and sustainable lobster population. Through strict regulations on lobster fishing, such as implementing size limits, prohibiting the taking of egg-bearing females, and limiting the number of lobster traps, Maine ensures that the lobster population remains stable and continues to be a reliable source for delicious seafood.

3. Quality and freshness: Due to its coast-to-table approach, Maine's steakhouses can offer the freshest lobster dishes possible. Freshly caught lobsters are typically prepared and served within a short time, ensuring that the taste and quality of the lobster remains at its peak.

4. Culinary reputation: Maine has earned a strong reputation for its seafood, particularly its lobsters. Maine lobster is widely regarded as some of the best in the world. This reputation attracts locals and tourists alike to try the authentic Maine lobster experience at steakhouses and seafood restaurants throughout the state.

5. Economic impact: The lobster industry plays a significant role in Maine's economy. As a result, the locals take great pride in supplying and serving high-quality, fresh-caught lobsters to customers. Steakhouses in Maine are well-supported by the local community and visitors alike, ensuring a continued demand for fresh seafood.

In contrast, Texas, Michigan, Kansas City, and Ohio do not have the same access and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, where lobsters are found in large numbers. These states may still offer lobster dishes on their menus, but the likelihood of it being fresh-caught decreases significantly. 

Therefore, the obvious answer out of the given options is Maine, as it is the only state where steakhouses can offer fresh-caught lobster due to its ideal geographic location, sustainable fishing practices, and well-established lobster industry.
