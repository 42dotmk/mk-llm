Q: Three adults whose average weight is 140 pounds went first in the elevator. Two children whose average weight is 64 pounds also went inside. If an elevator sign reads “Maximum weight 600 pounds.", what is the maximum weight of the next person to get in the elevator so that it will not be overloaded?
A: The sum of the weights of the three adults is 140 x 3 = 420 pounds. The sum of the weight of the two children is 64 x 2 = 128 pounds. So the total weight of the 5 people who are in the elevator is 420 + 128 = 548 pounds. This would mean that the next person's weight must not exceed 600 - 548 = 52 pounds. The answer is 52.
Question: Mrs. Carlton gives out penalty points whenever her students misbehave. They get 5 points for interrupting, 10 points for insulting their classmates, and 25 points for throwing things. If they get 100 points, they have to go to the office. Jerry already interrupted twice and insulted his classmates 4 times. How many times can he throw things before he gets sent to the office?
Answer: For interrupting, Jerry got 5 points per interruption * 2 interruptions = 10 points. For insulting, he got 10 points per insult * 4 insults = 40 points. To get to the 100 limit points, Jerry has 100 points - 10 points - 40 points = 50 points left. He still has 50 points / 25 points per throw = 2 throws. The answer is 2.

Q: Ben's new car cost twice as much as his old car. He sold his old car for $1800 and used that to pay off some of the cost of his new car. He still owes another $2000 on his new car. How much did his old car cost, in dollars?
A: His new car costs 1800 + 2000 = 3800 dollars. His old car cost 3800 / 2 = 1900 dollars. The answer is 1900.
Question: The teacher told the class that if they averaged at least 75% on their final exam, they could have a pizza party. Everyone took the exam on Monday, except for William, who was allowed to take it on Tuesday. If there are 30 people in the class, and the average before he took the test was a 74%, what score does he have to get to make sure they get to have a pizza party?
Answer: Let x be the score that William needs to achieve. Since there are 30 people in the class, there are 30 - 1 = 29 people without him. Since their average was a 74%, this means that (29 * 74 + x) / 30 > = 75. Thus, 29 * 74 + x > = 30 * 75. Thus, 29 * 74 + x > = 2250. Thus, 2146 + x > = 2250. Thus, x > = 2250 - 2146. Thus, x > = 94. The answer is 94.
Q: A spaceship is traveling to another planet. The spaceship travels at a consistent speed its entire journey unless it is stopped for the crew’s break.
