In a small English town during the 19th century, a wealthy and respected businessman named Sir Geoffrey Radcliffe is wrongfully sentenced to death for the murder of Michael, a close friend and business associate. The public is shocked to hear the news of his arrest, as Radcliffe is known for his benevolent nature and strong sense of justice. Despite his pleas of innocence and the lack of substantial evidence, the jury, swayed by the accusatory stories surrounding the high-profile case, unanimously finds him guilty.

Knowing that Radcliffe has been wronged and having a strong belief in his innocence, Dr. Frank Griffin, a scientist and Radcliffe's close friend, decides to take matters into his own hands. On the eve of the execution, the daring scientist enters the prison and covertly injects Radcliffe with an experimental invisibility drug, one he had been secretly developing for quite some time. Miraculously, the drug works, and Radcliffe disappears from sight. Taking advantage of the confusion that ensues in the prison, Radcliffe manages to escape, determined to clear his name and find the true murderer.

After getting the hang of his newfound invisibility and learning from Dr. Griffin how to use it to the best of his abilities, Radcliffe begins his mission to find the real killer. He secretly investigates his former business colleagues, as well as his own family members, in search of answers. The first lead he comes across is a recently promoted employee, Willie Spears, who has suddenly climbed the ranks within Radcliffe's company. The speed of his rise to power seems suspicious and motivates Radcliffe to delve deeper into Willie's background.

During his investigation, Radcliffe uncovers a myriad of lies and secrets, which ultimately leads him to confront a man named Cobb. As it turns out, Cobb is the true killer, responsible for Michael's murder. In a thrilling confrontation, the two men fight on top of a speeding coal wagon. Radcliffe's invisibility not only aids him in overcoming Cobb but also leaves the murderer feeling as if he is battling a ghost. Cobb finally confesses to the murder, unable to bear the terrifying feeling that his sins have returned to haunt him. However, before Radcliffe can bring him to justice, Cobb is killed as he loses his balance and falls off the moving coal wagon.

With Cobb's confession, Radcliffe's innocence is finally acknowledged, and the hunt for him comes to an end. However, the invisibility drug's effects are irreversible, and Radcliffe is forced to live the remainder of his life as an invisible man. He takes up a new role as a protector of justice, using his invisibility to uncover hidden truths and help those who cannot help themselves.

The most extraordinary aspect of Radcliffe's new life is his newfound ability to be heard and not seen. Vincent Price, a famous actor with an iconic voice, becomes Radcliffe's disembodied voice throughout the rest of the film. As Radcliffe continues his invisible crusade against evil, Vincent Price's haunting voiceover sends shivers down the spine of every evildoer who crosses paths with the once wrongfully accused Sir Geoffrey Radcliffe.
