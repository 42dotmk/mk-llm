[Question]Duke was at a garage sale when he spotted DVDs on sale. They were separated by price into 2 different boxes. In the first box, he found 10 movies that he wanted. These were $2.00 apiece. The second box was marked $5 each and he found 5 movies he wanted. What was the average price of each of the DVDs he bought?
[Answer]In the first box he bought 10 DVDs at $2.00 each, so he paid 10 * 2 = $20.00. In the second box he bought 5 DVDs at $5.00 each, so he paid 5 * 5 = $25.00. He bought 10 + 5 = 15 DVDs. He spent $20 + $25 = $45.00. The average price of each DVD is $45 / 15 = $3.00 each. The answer is 3.
Q: Gina and Tom were playing football. On the first day, Gina scored two goals, which was three less than Tom. On the second day, Gina scored two goals less than Tom who scored six goals. How many goals did Gina and Tom score during these two days?
A: On the second day, Gina scored 6 - 2 = 4 goals. So in total, on the second day, Gina and Tom scored 4 + 6 = 10 goals. On the first day Tom scored 2 + 3 = 5 goals. So in total on the first day, both players scored 5 + 2 = 7 goals. During these two days, Gina and Tom scored 10 + 7 = 17 goals. The answer is 17.

[Question]Vincentâ€™s washer broke so he had to go to the laundromat. On Wednesday he washed six loads of clothes. The next day he had time to wash double the number of loads he did the day before. On Friday he had a test and could only manage half of the loads he did on Thursday. On Saturday the laundromat closed at noon and he could only wash a third of the loads of laundry he did on Wednesday. How many loads of laundry had he washed that week?

Q: Mell went to a cafeteria to spend some time with her friends. She ordered two cups of coffee and one piece of cake. Two of her friends ordered the same, but each of them also bought a bowl of ice cream. One cup of coffee is $4, one piece of cake is $7, and a bowl of ice cream is $3. How much money did Mell and her friends need to pay at the cafeteria?
A: Mell's friends bought two bowls of ice cream, so that was a cost of 2 * 3 = $6. They all three bought two cups of coffee each, so they ordered 2 * 3 = 6 cups of coffee in total. The cost of the coffee was therefore 6 * 4 = $24. All her friends bought one piece of cake each, so the cost of it in total was 3 * 7 = $21. Mell and her friends spent in total 6 + 24 + 21 = $51 at the cafeteria. The answer is 51.
