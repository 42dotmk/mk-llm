Question: Isabelle gets a job so she can save enough money to go to a concert with her two brothers. Her ticket costs $20. Her brothers both get the childrenâ€™s discount, and each of their tickets cost $10. Her brothers have saved $5 between the two of them and Isabelle has saved $5. If her job pays $3 per week, how many weeks must she work to afford the tickets?
Answer: The tickets for both of her brothers will cost her $10 * 2 = $20. To buy tickets for all of them, it will cost Isabelle $20 + $20 = $40. Between all of them, they have saved a total of $5 + $5 = $10. Since they have already saved $10, she needs to earn an additional $40 - $10 = $30 to afford the tickets. Since she makes $3 per week, it will take her $30 / ($3 / week) = 10 weeks to save enough money for all of the tickets. The answer is 10.
[Question]Tom swims for 2 hours at a speed of 2 miles per hour. He then runs for half the time at 4 times the speed. How many miles did he cover?
[Answer]He swam 2 * 2 = 4 miles. He ran for 2 / 2 = 1 hour. His running speed was 2 * 4 = 8 mph. So he ran 8 * 1 = 8 miles. So his total distance was 8 + 4 = 12 miles. The answer is 12.
Q: Tony has a terrible toothache and decides to buy some painkillers from the store. He picks up a bottle of 50 pills and takes them home. He takes 2 pills each day three times a day for the first 2 days, before cutting this amount in half for the next 3 days. On the sixth day, he takes a final 2 pills in the morning and ends up feeling better. How many pills are left in the bottle?
A: Tony starts with 50 pills and takes 2 pills each 3 times a day, meaning he takes 2 * 3 = 6 pills in total. Tony repeats this process for two days in total, meaning over those two days he takes 2 * 6 = 12 pills. Tony then cuts down his pill usage in half, meaning he's now taking 6 / 2 = 3 pills a day. Since he repeats this process for three days, that means he takes 3 * 3 = 9 pills for that period. Adding in the two pills Tony took on the final day, that means he took 12 + 9 + 2 = 23 pills. Since there were 50 pills in the bottle to begin with, this means Tony has 50 - 23 = 27 pills remaining. The answer is 27.
Question: Roman the Tavernmaster has $20 worth of gold coins. He sells 3 gold coins to Dorothy. After she pays him, he has $12. How many gold coins does Roman have left?
