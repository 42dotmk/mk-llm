To successfully accomplish the goal of preventing rainbow bread dough from sticking to your work surface while kneading, several key steps and strategies should be followed:

1. **Choose the Right Surface:** The first step is to ensure you have the right surface for kneading. This can greatly affect how much the dough sticks. Hardwood, granite, marble, or stainless steel surfaces can be good choices. Make sure the surface is clean and dry before you start.

2. **Properly Prep the Surface:** Use a dusting of flour on your kneading surface. This will act as a barrier between the dough and the counter, reducing the likelihood of sticking. But be careful not to use too much flour that will significantly alter the bread's consistency. A light dusting should suffice.

3. **Oil the Surface:** Alternatively, you can apply a light layer of oil to your hands and work surface. A little oil can prevent the dough from sticking without adding extra dry ingredients into your dough. It's better to opt for neutral oils so as to not alter the taste of your rainbow bread. 

4. **Chill the Dough:** Another technique is to chill the dough in the refrigerator before you begin kneading. Cold dough tends to be less sticky. Just be sure to factor this into your proofing time, as cold dough will take longer to rise.

5. **Gradual Kneading:** Rather than plopping the entire dough onto your surface and starting to knead, tear off manageable pieces, and knead them one at a time. This prevents the entire mass from sticking on the surface while enabling you to gradually adjust the dough's consistency.

6. **Regular Cleaning:** It is important to clean your surface in between kneading intervals if you are working with a large quantity of dough this reduces the chance of excess dough sticking to your workspace.

7. **Work Quickly:** The longer the dough sits in one place, the more it will stick. Try to knead and rotate the dough continually so it doesn't have time to stick. Using the heel of your hand to push and fold the dough can be an effective kneading method that minimizes sticking.

8. **Proper Hydration:** If your dough is overly hydrated, it may stick more. Ensure that your dough has the proper balance of dry and wet ingredients based on the recipe you’re using. If it gets too sticky, slowly add more flour, a spoonful at a time, until it reaches the right consistency.

9. **Use of Dough Scrapers:** Consider using a dough scraper, a flat, flexible piece of metal or plastic that effectively unsticks dough and also helps in gathering and lifting the dough when kneading. They are cheap, effective, and make cleanup a breeze.

10. **Use of Silicone Mat:** One final strategy might be using a silicone mat specifically designed for kneading and rolling dough. These mats provide a non-stick surface and are easy to clean up after your bread preparation.

Achieving the right consistency with dough takes practice. If you’re new to baking, don’t be discouraged if your dough sticks a bit at first. With each bake, you’ll get a feel for the dough and how to handle it. The important thing is to keep experimenting and learn what works best for you.
