church committee had implemented a set of rigorous rules and guidelines for accepting new members into their congregation. These rules were not only put into place to ensure that the members shared the same spiritual beliefs, but also to preserve the sanctity and integrity of the church; this was done in response to a recent surge in individuals joining religious institutions with the intent to sway or dismantle long-held beliefs and practices.

The new member, whose name was Samuel, had been attending church services for a few months and was quite keen on joining the religious community. However, the church committee had reservations about his admission due to certain aspects of his background that were not aligned with their principles. Samuel had a history of activism and involvement in various social causes that the church deemed too radical and controversial. Additionally, he had been open about his prior religious affiliations, which appeared to be quite fluid and ever-changing, causing the committee to question the sincerity and depth of his commitment to their faith.

One of the main reasons the church decided to deny Samuel's application for membership was his social media presence. On platforms like Facebook and Twitter, Samuel had shared highly charged opinions on topics such as politics, race, and gender - many of which were in direct conflict with the church's teachings and values. The committee felt that allowing Samuel to become a member might create tension within their congregation, given the strong emotions and debates surrounding such topics. They wanted to maintain a peaceful and focused environment for their members to grow in their spirituality, without having to grapple with controversial issues that could derail their religious journeys.

Another important factor in the church's decision was their adherence to strict behavioral and moral codes for members. In their bylaws, they had outlined that all members must uphold a certain level of moral conduct, which included abstaining from alcohol, drugs, and other vices that could impact their spiritual well-being. Through a thorough background check, the committee discovered that Samuel had had some legal troubles in the past related to substance abuse and disorderly conduct. Although Samuel claimed to have turned a new leaf and left his past behind him, the committee felt it was too much of a risk to admit him into their community.

In summary, the church didn't allow the new member into it because the committee believed that his background, social media presence, and history of activism and fluid religious affiliations posed a threat to the stability, sanctity, and cohesiveness of their religious community. They deemed that admitting Samuel as a member would risk diluting the church's core values, creating conflict, and potentially compromising the spiritual growth and unity of their congregation. They ultimately decided that, in order to preserve the integrity of their church and the well-being of their members, they had to uphold their rigorous admission standards and deny Samuel's application for membership.
