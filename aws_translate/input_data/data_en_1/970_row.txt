Q: Patty decides that to convince her brother and sister to do her chores in exchange for cookies. Patty agrees to give them 3 cookies for every chore they do. Each kid normally has 4 chores to do per week. Patty has $15 to buy cookies. Each pack of cookies contains 24 cookies and costs $3. How many weeks can Patty go without doing chores by paying her siblings with cookies?
A: Patty can buy 5 packs of cookies because 15 / 3 = 5. Patty gets 120 cookies because 5 x 24 = 120. Patty would need to pay 12 cookies per week because 3 x 4 = 12. Patty can avoid 10 weeks of chores because 120 / 12 = 10. The answer is 10.
Question: Max can mow the lawn in 40 minutes. If it takes him twice that long to fertilize the lawn, how long will it take him to both mow and fertilize the lawn?

[Question]Ravi can jump higher than anyone in the class. In fact, he can jump 1.5 times higher than the average jump of the three next highest jumpers. If the three next highest jumpers can jump 23 inches, 27 inches, and 28 inches, how high can Ravi jump?
[Answer]The total height the next three highest can jump is 78 inches because 23 + 27 + 28 = 78. The average height they can jump is 26 inches because 78 / 3 = 26. Ravi can jump 39 inches high because 26 x 1.5 = 39. The answer is 39.
Q: John has been having trouble sleeping lately. In the past week he was only able to get 3 hours of sleep on 2 of the days and on the remaining days he was only able to get 60% of the recommended 8 hours of sleep. How much sleep did he get this week?
A: For the 2 days he gets 2 * 3 = 6 hours. He gets 60% of the recommended amount for 7 - 2 = 5 days. On those days he gets 8 * .6 = 4.8 hours. So he gets 5 * 4.8 = 24 hours. So he gets a total of 24 + 6 = 30 hours of sleep. The answer is 30.
Question: Martha is grinding a spice paste. She adds 3 tablespoons of ginger, 1 teaspoon of cardamom, 1 teaspoon of mustard, 2 tablespoons of garlic, and four times as much chile powder as mustard. What percentage of the spice paste is ginger, rounded to the nearest integer? (Remember there are three teaspoons per tablespoon.)
Answer: First convert the ginger to teaspoons: 3 tablespoons * 3 teaspoons / tablespoon = 9 teaspoons. Then convert the garlic to teaspoons: 2 tablespoons * 3 teaspoons / tablespoon = 6 teaspoons. Then find how much chile powder there is: 1 teaspoon * 4 = 4 teaspoons. Then add up the amount of each spice to find the total amount: 9 teaspoons + 6 teaspoons + 4 teaspoons + 1 teaspoons + 1 teaspoon = 21 teaspoons. Then divide the amount of ginger by the total amount of spice paste and multiply by 100% to find the percentage of the spice paste that's ginger: 9 teaspoons / 21 teaspoons * 100% = 42.857, which rounds down to 43%. The answer is 43.
