Question: Aliens and Martians have different numbers of limbs. Aliens have three arms and eight legs, while Martians have half as many legs and twice as many arms. How many more limbs will five aliens have than five Martians?
Answer: Martians have 2 * 3 = 6 arms each. They have 8 / 2 = 4 legs each. Five martians will have 5 * 6 + 5 * 4 = 30 + 20 = 50 limbs. Five aliens will have 5 * 3 + 5 * 8 = 15 + 40 = 55 limbs. Five aliens will have 55 - 50 = 5 more limbs than five Martians. The answer is 5.

Q: When Diane turns 30, she will be half the age of Alex and twice as old as Allison. Diane is 16 years old now. What is the sum of the ages of Alex and Allison now?
A: When Dianne turns 30, Alex will be 30 x 2 = 60 years old. Allison will be 30 / 2 = 15 years old then. Dianne will turn 30 in 30 - 16 = 14 years. Currently, the age of Alex is 60 - 14 = 46. Currently, Allison is 15 - 14 = 1 year old. So, the sum of Alex and Allison's ages now is 46 + 1 = 47 years old. The answer is 47.

[Question]Tony drives a car that gets 25 miles to the gallon. He drives 50 miles round trip to work 5 days a week. His tank holds 10 gallons. He begins the week with a full tank and when he runs out he fills up at the local gas station for $2 a gallon. How much money does Tony spend on gas in 4 weeks?
[Answer]First, we need to determine how many miles Tony drives in 4 weeks. We do this by performing 50 * 5 = 250 miles per week. Next, we multiply the weekly total by 4 by performing 4 * 250 = 1000 miles in 4 weeks. Now, we need to find out how many times Tony needs to fill up his gas tank. His gas tank holds enough gas to last 25 * 10 = 250 miles. This means in 4 weeks, he needs to fill up his tank 1000 / 250 = 4 times. Since Tony's gas tank holds 10 gallons, this means he needs to pay for 4 * 10 - 40 gallons of gas in a month. Since gas costs $2 a gallon, this means Tony spends 40 * 2 = $80 on gas every month,. The answer is 80.
