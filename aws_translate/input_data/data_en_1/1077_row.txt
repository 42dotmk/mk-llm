Yes, the Mexican War of Independence was a significant event that took place between 1810 and 1821, ultimately leading to Mexico's independence from Spanish rule. The conflict began on September 16, 1810, when Miguel Hidalgo, a Roman Catholic priest, issued the Grito de Dolores, calling for an uprising against Spanish colonial authorities. This marked the start of a long and bloody war, as Mexicans from all walks of life joined together in the fight for freedom and self-governance.

The war took place in several phases, with various leaders and factions taking charge of the revolutionary movement. One of the critical moments in the struggle for independence was when José María Morelos, another priest and a prominent leader in the war, declared Mexico's independence on November 6, 1813, in the Congress of Chilpancingo. However, the war continued as the Spanish authorities did not recognize the declaration and engaged in numerous counterattacks against the revolutionaries.

In 1820, political turmoil in Spain due to a liberal revolution weakened the Spanish monarchy, providing a valuable opportunity for the Mexican independence movement. By this time, several royalist commanders had begun to change their stance and celebrate Mexican nationalism. The most notable of these commanders was Agustín de Iturbide, who had fought against the independence movement but eventually became an advocate for Mexican autonomy.

Recognizing the changing tides, Iturbide collaborated with the revolutionary leader, Vicente Guerrero, to develop the Plan of Iguala, which outlined the goals for establishing a sovereign Mexican state. The plan called for three essential principles: the establishment of a Mexican Empire with a constitutional monarchy, the Roman Catholic Church as the nation's only religion, and the equal treatment of Spanish and American-born citizens.

On February 24, 1821, the Plan of Iguala was proclaimed, and the Army of the Three Guarantees, composed of both independence and royalist factions, was formed. The combined forces marched toward Mexico City, gaining support and momentum along the way, ultimately leading to the collapse of the Spanish colonial government.

On August 24, 1821, representatives from the Spanish government and the Mexican independence movement, led by Iturbide, signed the Treaty of Córdoba. This document recognized the independence of Mexico and the establishment of the First Mexican Empire, making the Plan of Iguala its basis for governance.

On September 27, 1821, the Army of the Three Guarantees entered Mexico City, marking the official end of the Mexican War of Independence. The first emperor of Mexico, Agustín de Iturbide, took the oath of office on September 28, and on October 4, Viceroy Juan O'Donojú, the last Spanish official in Mexico, left the country.

In conclusion, the Mexican War of Independence was won on September 27, 1821, when the Army of the Three Guarantees, consisting of former revolutionaries and royalist forces, triumphantly entered Mexico City. Their entrance symbolized the victory and the culmination of an 11-year struggle for Mexican independence from Spanish rule.
