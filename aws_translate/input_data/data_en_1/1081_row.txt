The original text states that the speaker is contemplating moving to New York and how much they will miss their current location. The question asked, however, appears to misconstrue the text. If we reframe the question to better align with the original text, such as "Why will the speaker miss their current location?" or "Why do they feel moving to New York will be difficult?" it is more appropriate for the context.

Assuming the question is "Why will the speaker miss their current location?", the answer can be derived from the emotions and thoughts that the speaker shares in the text. It seems that the speaker has developed a strong sentimental attachment to their present location, as evident from their appreciation of the beautiful eastern clouds and city lights.

One reason the speaker will miss their current location is the emotional connection they have to the natural beauty that surrounds them. The text suggests that the eastern clouds and city lights are something they find exceptionally beautiful, which may not be as prevalent or as readily visible in New York. This comforting view has perhaps become an integral part of the speaker's life, and they may fear losing this connection when they move to New York.

Another reason the speaker will miss their current place of residence could be the relationships and familiarity they have developed within their community. Integrating oneself into a new community can be both emotionally and physically taxing, which can be a source of hesitation for the speaker. Moving to a different city like New York likely implies leaving behind friends, family, and places that hold special memories. The unknown can be daunting - especially when it comes to creating a new support network, which the speaker may feel uncertain about building in New York.

In addition to the emotional connections, the speaker may also be worried about the practical challenges associated with moving to a city like New York. New York City is known for its hustle and bustle, high living costs, and competitive atmosphere. These factors could contribute to the speaker's apprehension about moving there. Their current location might offer a more peaceful, slower pace of life that they have grown accustomed to and would be unwilling to let go.

Furthermore, the speaker might have concerns about the differences in lifestyle that they would have to adapt to in New York. For instance, the high cost of living in New York could necessitate a higher-paying job and longer working hours, which could affect work-life balance. The increased noise levels, potential increase in pollution, and crowded spaces could also affect the speaker's quality of life and create tension around their impending move.

In summary, the speaker will miss their current location due to the emotional connections they have built with their surroundings, the relationships they have formed within their community, potential lifestyle changes, and the challenges associated with adapting to the New York environment. These factors contribute to their mixed emotions about moving to New York and make the decision feel difficult and bittersweet.
