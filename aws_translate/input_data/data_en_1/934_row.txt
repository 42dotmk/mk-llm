[Question]There are 15 students in the art club. By the end of each quarter, each student makes two artworks. If there are four quarters in a school year, how many artworks can the art club collect in two school years?
[Answer]15 x 2 = 30 artworks can be collected in one quarter. So in one school year, a total of 30 x 4 = 120 artworks can be collected. Therefore, 120 x 2 = 240 artworks can be collected in two school years. The answer is 240.
Q: Caitlin makes bracelets to sell at the farmer’s market every weekend. Each bracelet takes twice as many small beads as it does large beads. If each bracelet uses 12 large beads, and Caitlin has 528 beads with equal amounts of large and small beads, how many bracelets can she make for this weekend?
A: Caitlin has 528 / 2 = 264 small beads. Each bracelet needs 12 * 2 = 24 small beads. Thus, Caitlin can make 264 / 24 = 11 bracelets for the farmer’s market this weekend. The answer is 11.
Question: A cook had 300 carrots in a bucket he was using to cook meals for a restaurant. Before lunch, he had used 2/5 of the carrots. By the end of the day, he had chopped and used 3/5 of the remaining carrots. How many carrots were not used that day?
Answer: Before lunch, the cook had used 2 / 5 * 300 = 120 carrots. The number of remaining carrots after the cook used 2 / 5 of them is 300 - 120 = 180. The cook had used 3 / 5 * 180 = 108 of the remaining carrots by the end of the day. The number of carrots that the cook did not use that day is 180 - 108 = 72. The answer is 72.
[Question]Roberto is raising chickens for eggs. He buys 4 chickens for $20 each. They cost $1 in total a week to feed and each produces 3 eggs a week that will last forever. He used to buy 1 dozen eggs a week and spent $2 per dozen. After how many weeks will the chickens be cheaper than buying his eggs?
[Answer]The chickens cost $80 because 4 x 20 = 80. His chickens produce a dozen eggs a week because 4 x 3 = 12. Each week that he has chickens is $1 cheaper than buying eggs because 2 - 1 = 1. After 80 weeks his chickens will be paid off because 80 / 1 = 80. After 81 weeks the chickens will be cheaper than buying eggs because 80 + 1 = 81. The answer is 81.
Q: Palmer loves taking photos and has an album of 100 photos under her bed to mark memories of places she's been. She recently went on a long trip to Bali. Palmer took 50 new pictures in the first week and twice that many in the second week. She was running out of space at the end of her trip and took only 80 new photos total across the third and fourth weeks. If she adds the pictures from Bali to her collection, how many total photos does Palmer have under her bed now?
A: While in Bali, Palmer took 50 pictures in the first week and thus 2 * 50 photos = 100 photos in the second week. The total number of photos she took in Bali is 50 photos on the first week + 100 photos on the second week + 130 photos = 280 photos. When she adds the photos she from Bali to her album, Palmer has a total of 280 + 100 = 380 photos. The answer is 380.
