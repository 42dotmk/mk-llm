[Question]A café has a few orders to cook and also needs to makes sandwiches for a group of customers that arrived. 3 local offices have each ordered 10 bacon sandwiches and half of the group that has arrived have asked for 4 bacon sandwiches each. If the café makes a total of 54 bacon sandwiches, how many customers are in the group of customers that arrived?
[Answer]The offices ordered a total of 3 offices * 10 sandwiches each = 30 sandwiches. So the group of customers must have ordered 54 total sandwiches – 30 sandwiches for the offices = 24 sandwiches. This is a total of 24 sandwiches / 4 sandwiches per customer = 6 customers who ordered a sandwich. As only half the group ordered a bacon sandwich, the entire group must have consisted of 6 customers * 2 = 12 customers. The answer is 12.
Q: Six more than twice as many ducks go to North Pond as go to Lake Michigan. If Lake Michigan has 100 ducks, how many ducks can you safely estimate there will be at North Pond?
A: To determine the number of ducks at North Pond, we must first perform 100 * 2 = 200 to find the number to add 6 ducks to. We then take this number and add 6 to it, performing 200 + 6 = 206 ducks in total at North Pond. The answer is 206.
Question: A parking garage of a mall is four stories tall. On the first level, there are 90 parking spaces. The second level has 8 more parking spaces than on the first level, and there are 12 more available parking spaces on the third level than on the second level. The fourth level has 9 fewer parking spaces than the third level. If 100 cars are already parked, how many cars can be accommodated by the parking garage?
Answer: The second level has 90 + 8 = 98 parking spaces. The third level has 98 + 12 = 110 parking spaces. The fourth level has 110 - 9 = 101 parking spaces. So the parking garage can accommodate 90 + 98 + 110 + 101 = 399 cars. Thus, the parking garage can still accommodate 399 - 100 = 299 cars. The answer is 299.
[Question]Justin is 26 years old. When he was born his elder sister Jessica was 6 years old. James is their elder brother and is 7 years older than Jessica. How old will James be after 5 years?

Q: Sebastian plays drums for percussion in an orchestra. He sits next to the brass section where four people play trombone, two play trumpet, and one plays a French horn. In front of them are the strings section with three violinists, a cellist, and a contrabassist. Next to the strings are a trio of clarinets and a quartet of flute players in the woodwinds section. The maestro conducts them all. How many people are in the orchestra?
A: Sebastian in the percussion section makes 1 person. The brass section has 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 people. The strings section has 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 people. The woodwinds section has 3 + 4 = 7 people. The maestro is 1 person. Thus, the orchestra has 1 + 7 + 5 + 7 + 1 = 21 people in it. The answer is 21.
