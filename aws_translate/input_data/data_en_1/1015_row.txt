No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They are two separate situations with unique elements and entail different approaches in addressing the respective concerns.

Question 1 is related to an individual who is having a sexual relationship with someone that is not committing on an emotional level or in terms of a serious relationship. 

In this situation, a possible course of action would be to:

1. Reflect on your own feelings and expectations: Determine if you are looking for a committed relationship or if you are fine with a casual arrangement. Knowing what you want will make addressing the situation easier.

2. Communicate openly: Talk to the person involved about your feelings, expectations, and concerns. Honest communication is crucial for understanding each other's perspectives, thereby setting the foundation for a decision moving forward.

3. Set boundaries: Establish clear boundaries that protect your emotional and physical well-being. It's crucial not to allow someone to take advantage of your feelings, and setting boundaries can help to prevent this.

4. Evaluate the relationship: Assess whether the relationship is positively affecting your life, providing you with emotional growth, and adequately fulfilling your emotional needs. If it isn't, it may be best to move on.

5. Seek professional advice: In case the situation becomes overwhelming, consider consulting a therapist or counselor to help process your feelings and guide you in making well-informed decisions.

Question 2 pertains to a person in a long-term relationship facing significant external pressures due to their partner's parents' disapproval. The issue stems from the girlfriend's parents threatening to commit suicide if the relationship continues, despite sharing the same caste and community.

In this scenario, the possible course of action would be:

1. Communication and understanding: Talk to your girlfriend openly about the situation, understanding her feelings, fears, and perspectives. Listen to her concerns and share your thoughts on how to handle the situation together.

2. Respect her decisions: It's essential to stand by your girlfriend's side while also respecting her decision-making process. Understand that she faces tremendous pressure and that any decision made should involve both parties' consent.

3. Seek a mediator: Consider seeking help from a trusted family member, friend, or community member who can help mediate or facilitate a conversation between the two families to help them understand your bond and intentions better.

4. Build a supportive framework: Focus on strengthening your relationship with your girlfriend and maintain emotional security, ensuring a steady support system outside her family.

5. Consider professional help: If the situation continues to escalate, both you and your girlfriend should contemplate seeking therapy or counseling to help in dealing with the emotional turmoil and guide you on your next steps.

In summary, while both questions touch upon relationship complications, the underlying issues and possible solutions in each case are distinct, making them separate inquiries.
