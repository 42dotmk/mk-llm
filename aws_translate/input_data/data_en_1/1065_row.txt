[Question]Lisa was collecting socks to donate to a homeless shelter. She bought 12 pairs at a discount store. Sandra, her friend, came over and brought her 20 pairs of socks. Her cousin showed up with one-fifth the number of pairs that Sandra bought. After work, Lisaâ€™s mom brought 8 more than three times the number of pairs Lisa started with. How many pairs of socks did Lisa end up with?
[Answer]Her cousin brought over 20 / 5 = 4 pairs of socks. Three times more than Lisa bought was 12 * 3 = 36. Her mom brought 36 + 8 = 44 pairs of socks. In total Lisa had 12 + 20 + 4 + 44 = 80 pairs of socks. The answer is 80.
Q: Lionel went to the grocery store and bought 14 boxes of Graham crackers and 15 packets of Oreos. To make an Oreo cheesecake, Lionel needs 2 boxes of Graham crackers and 3 packets of Oreos. After making the maximum number of Oreo cheesecakes he can with the ingredients he bought, how many boxes of Graham crackers would he have left over?
A: Lionel has enough Graham crackers to make 14 / 2 = 7 Oreo cheesecakes. Lionel has enough Oreos to make 15 / 3 = 5 Oreo cheesecakes. Therefore, the maximum number of cheesecakes Lionel can make is 5. Lionel needs 2 * 5 = 10 boxes of Graham crackers to make 4 cheesecakes. He'll have 14 - 10 = 4 boxes left over. The answer is 4.
Question: Joan collects rocks. In her collection of rock samples, she had half as many gemstones as minerals yesterday. Today, she went on a rock collecting trip and found 6 more mineral samples. If she has 48 minerals now, how many gemstone samples does she have?

[Question]Rohan owns a 20-square meter coconut farm. Each square meter has 2 coconut trees and each tree has 6 coconuts. If the coconuts can be harvested every 3 months and each coconut costs $0.50, how much will he earn after 6 months?
[Answer]Rohan has a total of 20 x 2 = 40 coconut trees. And he has a total of 40 x 6 = 240 coconuts. So, the total coconut he will have after 6 months is 240 x 2 = 480. Therefore, the total amount he will earn is 480 x $0.50 = $240. The answer is 240.
Q: Ginger likes to make cakes for every holiday for people. She has 2 children, each of whom she bakes a cake for on their birthdays, Christmas, Easter, and Halloween. She has a husband for whom she makes a cake on these same holidays, as well as on their anniversary and Valentine's Day. Lastly, she makes both her parents cakes as well, but only for their birthdays since they live far away. How many cakes does she make in 10 years?
A: Ginger has 2 children whom she bakes for 4 times a year, for 2 * 4 = 8 cakes. She makes her husband 6 cakes a year. She makes each of her 2 parents a cake for 2 * 1 = 2 cakes. On a yearly basis, she therefore makes 8 + 6 + 2 = 16 cakes. In 10 years, she would make 16 * 10 = 160 cakes. The answer is 160.
