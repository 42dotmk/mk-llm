Q: Carson is refilling his tires. Each tire can hold 500 cubic inches of air. Two of the tires are completely flat and empty. One tire is 40% full and the last tire is 70% full. If Carson injects 50 cubic inches of air with each pump, how many pumps will it take him to fill all the tires?
A: First, if the a full tire needs 500 cubic inches of air, then two empty tires need: 500 cubic inches / tire * 2 tires = 1000 cubic inches. Accordingly, the 40% - full tire needs 500 cubic inches * (100% - 40%). So, we find the 40% - full tire needs 500 cubic inches * (60%) = 300 cubic inches. And, the 70% - full tire needs 500 cubic inches * (100% - 70%). So, the 70% - full tire needs 500 cubic inches * (30%) = 150 cubic inches. Now add up the needs of all the tires to find the total number of cubic inches needed: 1000 cubic inches + 300 cubic inches + 150 cubic inches = 1450 cubic inches. Finally, if the pumps each hold 50 cubic inches, the total number of pumps needed is 1550 cubic inches / 50 cubic inches / pump = 29 pumps. The answer is 29.
Question: Francine drives 140km to work each day. If she does not go to work 3 days every week, find the total distance she drives to work for 4 weeks in kilometers.
Answer: There are 7 days in a week, so if he doesn't go to work for 3 days, he goes 7 - 3 = 4 days every week. He travels 140km each day for a weekly total of 140 * 4 = 560km. In 4 weeks he will travel a total of 4 * 560 = 2240km. The answer is 2240.

Q: Jenny lives 5000 feet from her school, and every day she walks home. One day as she was walking home from school, she dropped 1 kernel of popcorn per 25 feet she walked. Later that evening, a squirrel came and ate one-quarter of the popcorn Jenny had dropped on her way home. If Jenny walks to school the following morning and counts the popcorn on the ground, what is the total number of popcorn kernels she will find remaining on the ground?
A: She originally dropped 5000 / 25 = 200 kernels of popcorn. The squirrel ate 200 / 4 = 50 kernels of popcorn. Therefore, 200 - 50 = 150 kernels of popcorn remain on the ground. The answer is 150.
Question: Every bedtime, Juwella reads a book. Three nights ago, she read 15 pages. Two nights ago she read twice that many pages, while last night she read 5 pages more than the previous night. She promised to read the remaining pages of the book tonight. If the book has 100 pages, how many pages will she read tonight?
Answer: Juwella read 15 x 2 = 30 pages two nights ago. She read 30 + 5 = 35 pages last night. She read a total of 15 + 30 + 35 = 80 pages for three nights. Thus, she needs to read 100 - 80 = 20 pages tonight to finish the book. The answer is 20.
