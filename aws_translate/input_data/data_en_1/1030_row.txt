Option 1: Christopher doesn't have arms.

Christopher and Kyle had known each other since high school. Back then, they were simply classmates, but as time passed, they got closer and became best friends. Christopher was born without arms, and Kyle had always been supportive and empathetic towards his friend's situation.

After graduating from college, they decided to move in together and face the world as two young professionals. Christopher was a remote software developer, relying mostly on voice-command coding programs, while Kyle worked in finance. Despite their different fields, their friendship grew stronger than ever.

As adults, Christopher's reliance on Kyle for daily activities increased. Though he tried to retain as much independence as possible, he couldn't help depending on Kyle for things like cooking meals, doing laundry, or helping him with his personal hygiene.

Kyle, being the kind-hearted and caring person he was, never complained or hesitated in helping his friend. But sometimes, he couldn't help but feel that he was taking on too much responsibility. Feeling overburdened, Kyle finally decided to talk to Christopher about finding ways to lessen his friend's dependence on him.

They searched for solutions together, and soon came across various technologies that could assist Christopher in becoming more independent. They discovered robotic prosthetic arms that Christopher could control with his mind. After some consideration, Christopher decided to go through the procedure of getting these prosthetics, which would allow him to perform most daily tasks on his own.

Following a successful procedure, Christopher was now able to handle daily tasks such as cooking and doing laundry. Along with the physical changes, he gained newfound confidence and self-esteem. On the other hand, Kyle felt relieved that his friend could now perform these tasks independently and was proud of the progress Christopher had made.

To further increase Christopher's independence, they also decided to hire a part-time caregiver who could help both of them with house chores and Christopher's personal needs. The caregiver would also provide training on how to use any tools and gadgets specifically designed for people with disabilities.

As time went on, Christopher became more and more adept at using his robotic prosthetic arms and other tools. He even began exploring hobbies such as painting and woodworking, which he had never thought were possible before. Kyle also enjoyed a sense of relief from the day-to-day responsibilities he had once shouldered.

Christopher and Kyle continued to live together, their bond stronger than ever. However, now that they both shared responsibilities equally and had grown as individuals, their lives became less focused on Christopher's disability, and more focused on achieving their goals and dreams.

Their experience together taught them valuable lessons about friendship, empathy, and the power of determination. Christopher proved to himself and the world around him that despite the challenges life throws, resilience, and support from loved ones can help you achieve incredible things.
