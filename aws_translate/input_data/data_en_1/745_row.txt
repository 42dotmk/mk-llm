Q: Brad wanted to set up a lemonade stand to earn some money. Every gallon of lemonade would yield 16 glasses. He figured it would cost him $3.50 to make every gallon of lemonade. He made 2 gallons to sell and decided he would sell each glass for $1.00 He drank 5 glasses while sitting in his stand. He sold all but 6 glasses of lemonade. How much net profit did Brad earn?
A: He made 2 gallons and each gallon had 16 glasses so 2 * 16 = 32 glasses. He drank 5 glasses and had 6 left over which means he would not earn money on 5 + 6 = 11 glasses. The total revenue would come from 32 - 11 = 21 glasses. Each gallon cost $3.50 to make so the total cost was 2 * 3.50 = $7.00. He sold 21 glasses at $1.00 per glass for a total of 1 * 21 = $21.00. When you take his earnings of $21.00 and subtract the cost of $7.00 his total net profit was 21 - 7 = $14.00. The answer is 14.
Question: Bill composes 20 total math questions for money. Ryan composes twice as many problems as Bill, and Frank composes 3 times as many as Ryan. Assuming each person has to compose 4 different types of math problems in equal proportion out of the total amount, how many problems of each type does Frank compose?
Answer: Since Ryan composes twice as many problems as Bill's total of 20, this means Ryan composes 20 * 2 = 40 problems. Frank composes 3 times as many as Ryan does, so this means Frank composes 40 * 3 = 120 problems. Since Frank needs to submit 4 types of problems in equal proportion out of his total, this means he needs to make 120 / 4 = 30 problems of each type. The answer is 30.
[Question]Martin is casting three bells for the church's belfry. The first bell takes 50 pounds of bronze, the second bell is twice the size of the first bell, and the third bell is four times the size of the second bell. How much bronze does he need total?
[Answer]First find the size of the second bell: 50 pounds * 2 = 100 pounds. Then find the size of the third bell: 100 pounds * 4 = 400 pounds. Then add the amount of bronze used for each bell to find the total: 100 pounds + 400 pounds + 50 pounds = 550 pounds. The answer is 550.
Q: A family is going to the amusement park. The adult tickets cost $22 for admission, and the tickets for children cost $7. The family consists of 2 adults and 2 children. What is the total price the family will pay for admission?
A: To solve this problem you can set up an equation to represent the total price the family will pay, with a representing the number of adult tickets, c representing the number of childrenâ€™s tickets, and p representing the total price of admission. Thus 22a + 7c = p. Plug in the number of adults and children that plan to go to the amusement park: 22(2) + 7(2) = $58 is the total cost for admission. The answer is 58.
