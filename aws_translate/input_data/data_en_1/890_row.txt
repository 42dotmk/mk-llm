So far, there has clearly been no unified community policy on urban issues, even though more than three-quarters of the citizens of the Union live in urban areas.

Urban issues have become increasingly important as the majority of the population in the European Union resides in cities and towns, where various economic, social, and environmental challenges arise. In spite of this, urban policy in the EU has been somewhat fragmented, with individual cities and member states addressing them in different ways. This lack of coherent policy may hinder the ability of the Union to collectively address the unique issues that urban areas face.

The absence of a unified community policy on urban issues can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the European Union covers a vast and diverse range of cities, each with their own distinct characteristics and specific local needs. This makes it difficult to formulate a single overarching policy that can address the unique challenges and opportunities of all cities. Secondly, urban policies often overlap with a range of other policy areas, such as housing, transportation, and environmental protection. This means that urban issues are often addressed through a mixture of local, regional, national, and EU level policies, creating a complex and fragmented policy landscape.

However, recognizing the importance of urban issues, the European Union has been making efforts to adopt a more coordinated and integrated approach to urban policy. One example is the establishment of the 'Urban Agenda for the EU,' which aims to involve various levels of government (local, regional, national, and EU) in addressing urban challenges. It does so through partnerships focusing on key priority areas such as air quality, urban mobility, energy transition, and affordable housing, among others. The Urban Agenda encourages collaboration, knowledge sharing, and best practice exchange among European cities, aiming to ensure that urban policy objectives are incorporated into relevant legislation and funding mechanisms.

Another important aspect of urban policy is the role of the EU structural and investment funds, which support urban development projects and contribute to improved living conditions for citizens. By allocating financial resources for urban projects, the EU promotes the development of sustainable and inclusive cities, encourages social cohesion, supports job creation, and fosters innovation and growth.

In conclusion, while it is true that there has historically been a lack of a unified community policy on urban issues within the European Union, efforts have been made in recent years to address this gap and enhance cooperation among various levels of government. The 'Urban Agenda for the EU' and the allocation of EU structural and investment funds for urban projects exemplify this shift towards a more coordinated and integrated approach to urban policy. However, the continued diversification and growth of urban areas in the EU necessitate ongoing efforts to refine and expand on this approach, ensuring that the needs and potential of European cities are adequately addressed.
