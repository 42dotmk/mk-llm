Q: Nancy wanted to make peanut butter cookies for a family gathering, but her cousin is allergic to peanuts. She decided to make almond butter cookies instead. A jar of almond butter costs three times the amount that a jar of peanut butter does. It takes half a jar to make a batch of cookies. A jar of peanut butter costs $3. How many dollars more does it cost per batch to make almond butter cookies instead of peanut butter cookies?
A: A jar of almond butter costs 3 * 3 = $9. It takes half a jar to make a batch of cookies, so it costs 9 / 2 = $4.50 to use almond butter. It costs 3 / 2 = $1.50 to use peanut butter. Thus, it costs 4.50 - 1.50 = $3 more to make a batch of almond butter cookies than peanut butter cookies. The answer is 3.
Question: Melanie does her weekly shopping at the farmer's market. She starts with an 8-ounce wheel of brie cheese. Next is a 1 pound loaf of bread. She grabs a pound of tomatoes and 2 pounds of zucchini. After that, she grabs 1 1/2 pounds of chicken breasts and treats herself to 8 ounces of fresh raspberries and 8 ounces of fresh blueberries. How many pounds of food does she buy?
Answer: She bought 8ounces of cheese, 8 - ounce raspberries, 8 ounces of blueberries for a total of 8 * 3 = 24 ounces. 16 ounces are in 1 pound and she has 24 ounces of food so she has 24 / 16 = 1.5 pounds of food. Those items are 1.5 pounds and she bought 1 pound of bread, 1 pound of tomatoes, 2 pounds of zucchini and 1.5 pounds of chicken for a total of 1.5 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1.5 = 7 pounds of food. The answer is 7.

Q: Bob can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes. How many oysters can he shuck in 2 hours?
A: He shucks 10 oysters in 5 minutes we need to know how many 5 minute units are in 60 minutes so 60 / 5 = 12 units. He can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes and there are 12 5 minute units in an hour so he can shuck 10 * 12 = 120 oysters in 1 hour. If he can shuck 120 oysters in 1 hour, so for 2 hours in can shuck 2 * 120 = 240 oysters. The answer is 240.
Question: Jerryâ€™s two daughters play softball on different teams. They each have 8 games this season. Each team practices 4 hours for every game they play. If each game lasts for 2 hours, how many hours will Jerry spend at the field watching his daughters play and practice altogether?
Answer: Jerry will spend 8 games x 2 hours per game = 16 hours watching one daughter play her games. He will spend 16 x 2 = 32 hours watching both daughters play their games. He will spend 8 games x 4 hours of practice = 32 hours watching one daughter practice. He will spend 32 x 2 = 64 hours watching both daughters practice. He will spend a total of 32 hours watching games + 64 hours watching practice = 96 hours. The answer is 96.
