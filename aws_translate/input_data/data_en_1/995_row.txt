Title: How the Addition of Costa and Fabregas Will Enhance Chelsea's Attacking Prowess 

Introduction:
Chelsea have been a dominant force in English football in recent years, but they have often struggled to break down opponents who employ a compact, defensive mindset - packing their half with 10 men behind the ball. Manager Jos√© Mourinho is well aware of this issue and has recently acknowledged the need for 'more quality' within the team's style of play. The signings of Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas could just be the solution to Chelsea's problem, providing a fresh attacking impetus capable of unlocking even the most resolute defences.

Step 1: Analyzing the problem
When facing a team that puts 10 men behind the ball, Chelsea often finds itself bereft of ideas and unable to create clear-cut chances. This is largely due to a lack of unpredictability in their play and an absence of players with the vision and skill to find those pockets of space or deliver that killer pass.

Step 2: Incorporating Costa and Fabregas
Acquiring the services of Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas brings a new dynamic to the Chelsea attack. Costa, known for his physicality and potency in front of goal, will occupy defenders and create space for his teammates. His movement off the ball and ability to finish from anywhere in the box makes him a constant threat.

Fabregas, on the other hand, offers something different from Chelsea's current crop of box-to-box midfielders. The Spanish international possesses a footballing brain that few can match, and he has the capacity to dictate play and provide incisive through balls in tight spaces. His creativity, coupled with his eye for a pass, will enable Chelsea to penetrate deep-lying defensive lines more effectively.

Step 3: Adapting the team's style of play
In order to fully exploit the talents of Costa and Fabregas, Mourinho must adjust the team's approach to matches. The Portuguese tactician should encourage his side to transition quickly from defence to attack, utilizing the pace and power of Costa coupled with the guile and inventiveness of Fabregas. By playing a more fluid and dynamic brand of football, Chelsea can keep their opposition unsettled and force them to reorganize constantly, creating openings and vulnerabilities for the likes of Costa and Fabregas to exploit.

Step 4: Capitalizing on set pieces
One other area where Chelsea can improve is their conversion rate from set pieces. With the likes of Costa, Gary Cahill, and John Terry all dangerous in the air, Fabregas' expertise at delivering accurate dead balls could prove to be an essential weapon in breaking down stubborn defensive units.

Conclusion:
The signing of Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas represents a step in the right direction for Chelsea in their quest to overcome deep-lying defences. While no tactic or player can guarantee success against opponents who sit back and park the bus, the presence of Costa and Fabregas within the Blues' ranks offers new layers of creativity and a tactical adaptability that should make the task of unlocking resolute backlines a far less daunting prospect for Mourinho's men this season.
