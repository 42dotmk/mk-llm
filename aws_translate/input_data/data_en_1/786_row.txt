Kobani, a strategic border town in Syria that has been under siege by ISIS for nearly a month. The fierce battle has seen thousands of Kurdish civilians flee into Turkey for safety, exacerbating an already severe refugee crisis in the region.

The Turkish government's decision to authorize military force and allow foreign troops to use its soil for launching operations is expected to significantly bolster the international coalition's efforts against ISIS in the region. This development is particularly crucial, given that Turkey shares a lengthy border with both Syria and Iraq, countries where ISIS has established de facto control over large territories.

Now, with Turkey's full commitment to the fight against ISIS, the United States and its coalition partners are likely to turn their attention to assisting Kurdish fighters in Kobani and other embattled areas. The Kurdish forces have been one of the most effective groups combating ISIS on the ground, as they have successfully defended their territories in both Iraq and Syria. Their assistance, along with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), has proven to be an essential element in combating the terrorist group.

As the Turkish military begins to plan and coordinate its operations against ISIS, it's likely that its first priority will be to secure the safety of the Turkish border and prevent the further expansion of ISIS forces from Syria into Turkish territory. This will likely involve close cooperation with Kurdish forces operating in the area.

In response to the question of why there has been apparently little assistance provided to Kurdish fighters in Northern Syria, some speculate that Western powers, including the United States, have been reluctant to directly support Kurdish forces due to domestic political considerations in Turkey and ongoing concerns about the aspirations of Kurdish nationalist movements in the region. Turkey, which has a substantial Kurdish minority, has long been wary of any move that could potentially empower Kurdish separatists and further complicate relations in the region.

However, now that Turkey has officially joined the fight against ISIS, it is likely that the United States and its allies will step up efforts to provide greater support to Kurdish forces. This may come in the form of increased air support, intelligence sharing, and potentially the delivery of much-needed weapons and ammunition to the Kurdish fighters on the ground.

In conclusion, the most logical completion of the news story is that the authorization of military force by Turkey's lawmakers will lead to a more concerted effort by the international coalition to support Kurdish fighters in their struggle against ISIS. With Turkey's participation, the United States and its partners will be better positioned to more effectively target ISIS in both Iraq and Syria, protect vulnerable populations, and ultimately degrade and defeat the terrorist group. Furthermore, the international community must continue to address the ongoing humanitarian crisis, offering assistance to the thousands of refugees fleeing violence and devastation in the region.
