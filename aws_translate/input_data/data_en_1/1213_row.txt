The most gold stored in the world is in the United States Bullion Depository, commonly known as Fort Knox. Fort Knox is a fortified military installation located near the city of Elizabethtown in the state of Kentucky, USA. It is operated by the United States Department of the Treasury and serves as a secure and confidential storage facility for a significant portion of the country's official gold reserves as well as other precious items belonging to the United States government.

Fort Knox was constructed in 1936 as a response to the escalating global tensions during the pre-World War II era. The US government required a fortified and secure location to protect its valuable assets, including gold and other essential resources. Upon its completion, the United States Bullion Depository instantly became the primary storage facility for the nation's gold reserves.

The vault at Fort Knox is renowned for its robust security features and protection levels. The exterior walls are made of reinforced concrete and lined with solid granite. Additionally, the vault door is a 22-ton blast-proof door designed to withstand explosions, cutting, or other sophisticated methods of attack. Cutting-edge security systems, including alarms and surveillance cameras, constantly monitor the facility. The United States Mint Police and the presence of the nearby Army post further augment the depository's security.

As of 2021, Fort Knox holds approximately 4,583 metric tons of gold, which accounts for around 77% of the total gold reserves owned by the United States. This immense stockpile is stored in the form of 368,000 standard 400-ounce gold bars.

It is worth noting that while Fort Knox possesses the most significant gold storage, several other facilities around the world also store sizeable quantities of gold. Some of these facilities include:

1. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, United States: Located in Manhattan, New York City, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is said to store approximately 6000 metric tons of gold in its underground vault. The gold stored here primarily belongs to foreign countries, central banks, and international organizations.

2. The Bank of England, United Kingdom: The Bank of England, located in London, maintains the third-largest gold storage facility in the world. It holds more than 400,000 gold bars, which weigh approximately 5,134 metric tons. Most of the gold stored here belongs to the central banks of the United Kingdom and other countries, international organizations, and the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) members.

3. The Swiss National Bank, Switzerland: Switzerland is home to several major gold storage facilities. The Swiss National Bank stores a significant portion of gold reserves in its vaults in Berne and Zurich. Altogether, Switzerland's official gold reserves amount to around 1,040 metric tons.

In summary, Fort Knox in the United States is the facility with the most gold storage globally, holding a significant portion of the country's official gold reserves. This highly secure and confidential facility serves as a symbol of the United States' economic strength and stability.
