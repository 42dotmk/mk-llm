Q: John pays for half the cost of raising a child. It cost $10,000 a year for the first 8 years and then twice that much per year until the child is 18. University tuition then costs $250,000. How much did it cost?
A: The first 8 years cost 8 * 10,000 = $80,000. The next 18 - 8 = 10 years. They cost 10000 * 2 = $20,000 per year. So they cost 20,000 * 10 = $200,000. So the cost was 200,000 + 80,000 = $280,000. Adding in the cost of tuition brings the cost to 250,000 + 280,000 = $530,000. Since John pays for half the cost of raising the child, he pays $530000 / 2 = 265000. The answer is 265000.
Question: Tony has to run several errands in a day. He needs to drive 10 miles to get groceries, 15 miles to get a haircut and 5 miles to go to a doctor's appointment. How many miles will Tony have driven when he is halfway through driving around for his errands?
Answer: First, we need to find the total number of miles Tony will be driving by adding 10 + 15 + 5 = 30 miles in total. To determine the halfway point, we simply divide the total number of miles by 2, performing 30 / 2 = 15 miles driven when Tony is halfway done. The answer is 15.
[Question]Tommy is making 12 loaves of bread. He needs 4 pounds of flour per loaf. A 10-pound bag of flour costs $10 and a 12-pound bag costs $13. When he is done making his bread, he has no use for flour and so he will throw away whatever is left. How much does he spend on flour if he buys the cheapest flour to get enough?
[Answer]He needs 48 pounds of flour because 12 x 4 = 48. He needs 4.8 bags of 10 pound bags because 48 / 10 = 4.8. He therefore needs to buy 5 bags of flour because 4 < 4.8 < 5. He spends $50 if he buys this flour because 5 x 10 = 50. He needs 4 bags of the 12 - pound flour because 48 / 12 = 4. He would spend $52 on the 12 - pound bags because 4 x 13 = 52. He spends $50 if he buys the cheapest flour because 50 < 52. The answer is 50.
Q: A couple with two children, ages 6 and 10 years old, decided to go to an amusement park. The regular ticket costs $109, but children below 12 years old have a $5 discount. If they gave the cashier $500, how much change will they receive?
A: The ticket costs 109 - 5 = $104 for each child. So the ticket cost of the two children is 104 x 2 = $208. The couple needs to pay the regular price, so it's 109 x 2 = $218. Thus, the family needs to pay a total of 208 + 218 = $426. Therefore, their change is 500 - 426 = $74. The answer is 74.
Question: Herman likes to feed the birds in December, January and February. He feeds them 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon. How many cups of food will he need for all three months?
Answer: December has 31 days, January has 31 days and February has 28 days for a total of 31 + 31 + 28 = 90 days. He feeds them 1 / 2 cup in the morning and 1 / 2 cup in the afternoon for a total of 1 / 2 + 1 / 2 = 1 cup per day. If he feeds them 1 cup per day for 90 days then he will need 1 * 90 = 90 cups of birdseed. The answer is 90.
