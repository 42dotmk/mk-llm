Folk musicians are not commonly classically trained. This aspect of folk musicians plays a significant role in the characteristics and development of folk music itself, as well as its influence on classical music composers.

Folk music arises mainly from oral traditions and is deeply rooted in the cultural and ethnic identity of a particular region or community. The music usually reflects the experiences, emotions, and historical stories of the people belonging to that region. Given its nature, folk music often evolves through generations as it is passed down, acquiring new elements, and reflecting the changing circumstances of the community.

Folk musicians typically learn their craft through informal settings such as family gatherings, community events, and informal mentoring. They often play traditional instruments that are native to their culture and use them to perform music which may include elements such as improvisation and variations on existing themes.

The lack of formal training in folk musicians presents a stark contrast to the structured education and technical prowess found in classically trained musicians. The classical music tradition stems from a written notation system, with well-established rules and a rich history of development. Composers who are classically trained generally have profound knowledge of music theory, orchestration, and structure, allowing them to use this foundation to create intricate and nuanced works.

Despite the differences between folk and classical music, several composers throughout history have recognized the value of integrating folk elements into classical compositions. Such composers not only pay homage to the cultural roots of their respective nations but also enhance their artistic works with unique textures and melodies. A few examples of these composers include:

1. Antonín Dvořák: A Czech composer known for incorporating folk influences into his compositions, Dvořák's works evoke a strong sense of national pride and identity. Notable examples are his Symphony No. 9 "From the New World," which was inspired by African-American spirituals and Native American music, and his Slavonic Dances, which draw upon influences from Slavic folk dances.

2. Bedřich Smetana: Another Czech composer, Smetana used folk themes and dances to infuse his compositions with a sense of national identity. His most famous work, "Má vlast," is a cycle of six symphonic poems, each representing an aspect of Czech culture, history, or landscape.

3. Béla Bartók: A Hungarian composer and pianist, Bartók was an avid collector and researcher of his country's folk music. He incorporated these folk influences into numerous compositions, merging them with classical forms to create a unique sound. His Mikrokosmos, a collection of piano exercises, and his series of string quartets are notable examples of this fusion.

These composers, among others, demonstrate how the distinctive qualities of folk music, despite its musicians not commonly being classically trained, can be woven into classical compositions, enriching both genres and broadening the scope of musical expression.
