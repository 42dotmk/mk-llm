The places that people now go to exercise, which were once exclusive to Greeks in the Hellenistic world, are largely the remnants of ancient gymnasiums and other locations associated with physical fitness and Greek culture. 

Gymnasiums in the Hellenistic period were not just venues for physical exercise, but also served as centers for education, cultural gatherings, and social events for the Greek elite. They played a critical role in the preservation and dissemination of Greek culture, offering spaces for various athletic, philosophical, and artistic pursuits. These gymnasiums were exclusive to Greeks, as a way to maintain their cultural identity and uphold the social hierarchy imposed on the native populations.

Today, the concept of a gymnasium has evolved significantly, and the modern-day gym has become a popular destination for people from various cultural backgrounds to engage in physical exercise. This shift towards inclusiveness can be attributed to significant changes in societal attitudes, breaking down the barriers that once prevented non-Greeks from participating in these spaces.

However, there are still a few places where traces of the ancient Greek gymnasium influence can be found. Some sites of ancient gymnasiums have been repurposed over time as public parks, sports complexes, or recreational areas, promoting physical activity within the communities while preserving the historical legacy of the ancient Greeks. Examples of these sites include:

1. The Ancient Agora of Athens (Greece): This site contains the remains of an ancient gymnasium known as the Palaestra, which dates back to the 4th century BCE. As a space for wrestling and other combat sports, the Palaestra was an integral part of the Athenian gymnasium complex.

2. Olympia (Greece): This archaeological site, once the location of the ancient Olympic Games, features the ruins of a gymnasium and a palaestra. Visitors to Olympia can still witness the remnants of these historic athletic venues while learning about their cultural significance.

3. Priene (Turkey): The ancient city of Priene, located in modern-day Turkey, was once a center of Hellenistic culture. The ruins of its gymnasium can still be seen today, including a large courtyard and a complex of baths.

4. Ephesus (Turkey): This ancient Greek city also contains the remains of a gymnasium and a palaestra. Today, Ephesus serves as an open-air museum, showcasing various historical artifacts and structures, including the gymnasium site.

In conclusion, while the concept of exclusive gymnasiums for Greeks has long been abandoned, the influence of these ancient spaces can still be found in the ruins of historic sites like those mentioned above. These locations remind us of the cultural legacy and uniqueness of the Hellenistic period and its impact on our modern understanding of physical fitness and well-being. However, it is important to recognize that today's gyms and fitness centers have evolved as inclusive spaces, open to people of all backgrounds, breaking down the barriers that once perpetuated inequality and cultural division in the ancient world.
