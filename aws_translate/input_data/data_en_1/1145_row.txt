Q: A father is building a playset for his son and needs to purchase lumber, nails, and fabric. When he started planning the project, the necessary lumber cost $450, the nails cost $30, and the fabric cost $80. However, recent economic inflation has caused the price of lumber to increase by 20%, the price of nails to increase by 10%, and the price of fabric to increase by 5%. In dollars, how much more money will it cost to complete the project now (after inflation) than it would have when the father began planning?
A: First, the initial, pre - inflation, cost of the project was 450 + 30 + 80 = $560. Then, the price of the lumber increased to 450 * 1.20 = $540. Similarly, the price of the nails increased to 30 * 1.10 = $33. And the price of the fabric increased to 80 * 1.05 = $84. Therefore, the new, post - inflation, cost of the project is 540 + 33 + 84 = $657. Thus, the cost has increased by 657 - 560 = $97. The answer is 97.
Question: Oliver has $40 and 200 quarters. If he gives his sister $5 and 120 quarters, how much money in total is he left with?
Answer: The 200 quarters equals 200 * $0.25 = $50. Oliver has a total of $40 + $50 = $90. He gives his sister 120 * $0.25 = $30 in total from the quarters. The total amount he gave to his sister is $30 + $5 = $35. Oliver is left with $90 - $35 = $55. The answer is 55.
[Question]Lola baked 13 mini cupcakes, 10 pop tarts, and 8 blueberry pies. Meanwhile, Lulu made 16 mini cupcakes, 12 pop tarts, and 14 blueberry pies. How many pastries have Lola and Lulu made altogether?
[Answer]They made 13 + 16 = 29 mini cupcakes altogether. They made 10 + 12 = 22 pop tarts altogether. They also made 8 + 14 = 22 blueberry pies altogether. Therefore they made a total of 29 + 22 + 22 = 73 pastries altogether. The answer is 73.
Q: Baking in batches of 65 cupcakes, Carla made 45 batches of cupcakes for her daughter's birthday party. She then took 5 cupcakes from each batch, and fed them to her dogs. If Carla's daughter had 19 friends and they shared the remaining cupcakes equally among them, including the daughter, calculate the number of cupcakes that each of Carla's daughter's friends ate.
A: If Carla sampled 5 cupcakes from each batch and fed them to her dogs, each batch had 65 - 5 = 60 cupcakes afterwards. Since Carla made 45 batches of cupcakes for her daughter's birthday party, after removing the 5 cupcakes from each batch, Carla's daughter and her friends received 45 * 60 = 2700 cupcakes. The total number of people at the party is 19 friends + 1 daughter = 20. After sharing the cupcakes equally among them, Carla's daughter and her friends each received 2700 / 20 = 135 cupcakes. The answer is 135.
Question: The three angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees. The largest angle is 5 times bigger than the smallest. The middle angle is 3 times bigger than the smallest. How many degrees is the smallest angle?
Answer: Let x be the smallest angle. The combination of the three is x + 3x + 5x = 9x. Thus 9x = 180. So x = 20. The answer is 20.
