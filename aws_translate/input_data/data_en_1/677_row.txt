The English first opened their factories in Eastern India during the early 17th century, specifically in the regions of present-day West Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. These areas were initially selected by the British due to their strategic location and the prospects for trade and commerce, which would eventually give rise to their economic dominance in the region. To better understand their decision, it is essential to analyze the historical progress of English establishments in Eastern India.

1. Hugli (Haldia) Factory:

The first English factory was established in Hugli (now Haldia) on the banks of the river Hooghly in 1651, under permission from the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. This factory was set up as a base for British merchants to conduct trade with the local population. The primary aim of setting up these factories was to gain access to valuable resources like textiles, spices, indigo, and saltpeter, which were in high demand in Europe.

2. The Masulipatnam Factories:

In 1611, before the Hugli Factory, the East India Company had established a factory in Masulipatnam, located on the southeastern coast of India (present-day Andhra Pradesh). However, this venture was not directly linked to Eastern India, as it served more like a foothold on the Indian southeastern coast.

3. Patna Factory:

In 1620, The British East India Company obtained permission from the Mughal emperor Jahangir to establish a factory in Patna, Bihar. The primary purpose of setting up this factory was to facilitate the trading of indigo and raw silk. However, this factory was subsequently shut down due to unfavorable conditions and lack of resources.

4. The Pipili and Balasore Factories:

The English East India Company established factories in Pipili (Orissa) and Balasore (then known as Barshalor, later Odisha) around 1633 to have a stronghold in the strategically important Ganges-Delta region. The factory in Balasore prospered largely due to its prime position on the Bay of Bengal and became one of the centers for exporting salt, textiles, and minerals.

5. Formation of Madras (Chennai) Presidency:

In the late 17th century, the English East India Company shifted its focus from Eastern India to Southern India, leading to the formation of the Madras Presidency in 1640. This newly formed region encompassed the entire eastern coast of India, and its factories and businesses operated under its jurisdiction. However, Eastern Indian factories would remain significant for trade with the newly formed Madras Presidency as well as other European nations.

As these historical developments suggest, Eastern India played a pivotal role in the expansion of the English East India Company's presence in the Indian subcontinent. The establishment of the Hugli factory marked the beginning of British involvement in Eastern India, which would later serve as the starting point for the colonization and exploitation of India in the following centuries. The British presence in Eastern India laid the groundwork for future imperialistic endeavors, ultimately resulting in the establishment of British rule over the Indian subcontinent.
