Communion?'' I inquired, curious about the origin and symbolism behind this ritual. The woman turned to face me, her expression soft and welcoming.

"In our culture, communion is a sacred ceremony that brings together our people and the divine powers we believe in. It symbolizes our connection and unity with the natural world, the spiritual realm, and one another. The term 'communion' comes from the idea of sharing or partaking in something significant and profound."

She paused, looking thoughtful as she continued, "We believe that in this world, there are forces greater than ourselves that influence our lives. These forces are present in our surroundings, the air, the sun, the moon, and especially in the creatures that inhabit our land. The flying creatures that you see outside our window, we call them the 'little holy ones' because we see them as messengers of the divine. They carry the spirit of the sacred in their wings and in their songs."

Noticing my fascination, the woman continued, "The full moon of spring is a unique time of the year for us. When the moon is full, it stands as a symbol of wholeness, unity, and abundance. Spring, on the other hand, represents new beginnings, renewal, and growth. So when the full moon occurs during spring, it marks a highly auspicious occasion. That's why we hold our communion on these three nights; we wish to partake in the combined essence of unity and new beginnings."

"We prepare for this communion weeks in advance," the woman explained. "The community comes together to clean and adorn our sacred spaces, gather offerings, and practice the rituals we've inherited from our ancestors. On each night of the communion, we gather under the moonlit sky, and the ceremony begins with singing, dancing, and storytelling. There is an air of joy and harmony during this time, as we connect with each other and honor the divine forces in our lives."

"At the peak of the ceremony, the little holy ones descend from the cliffs, attracted by the vibrations of our voices and the energy of the communion. Their presence signifies the approval and blessings of the divine. As they fly among us, we reach out and touch their feathers, allowing their sacred energy to flow through us, rejuvenating our spirits, and reminding us of our interconnectedness with the world and one another."

"The communion fosters a deep sense of community, gratitude, and love. When the ceremony ends, we carry that feeling with us in everything we do. Once a year may seem infrequent, but the impact of the communion is so profound that it sustains us throughout the year. It reminds us of our place in the world, our purpose, and the significance of our connection with one another and with the divine."

The woman smiled gently, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder and awe at her words. The communion seemed like a beautiful and meaningful tradition that brought people together and reinforced their bonds. It's a celebration of life, nature, and the extraordinary forces that shape our existence â€“ something that undoubtedly transcends time and space, binding us all in an eternal dance of unity and love.
