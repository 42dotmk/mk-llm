The two questions can indeed be considered paraphrases of each other, as they both address the same core idea: the rationale behind people asking questions on Quora that could readily be answered through a search engine.

To provide a more detailed analysis of why people behave this way, I'll further break down the possible reasons and factors contributing to this behavior:

1. **Convenience**: Some people might find it more convenient to ask questions on a platform like Quora, which facilitates interactions and discussions, rather than merely relying on search engine results. They may be already using Quora for other purposes and prefer to keep their inquiries consolidated within the same platform.

2. **Personalized answers**: When asking a question on Quora, users may receive responses tailored specifically to their concerns. Search engines can provide a vast array of information, but not all of it may be relevant or personalized to the individual asking the question. Quora allows them to obtain more context-specific answers from people with unique experiences and perspectives.

3. **Human connection**: Engaging in conversations and asking questions on platforms like Quora fosters a sense of community and connection with other users. Instead of simply obtaining information from search engines, individuals can interact with others who have shared experiences or expertise in a specific field. This creates a more human, and often more satisfying, learning experience.

4. **Subjective opinions**: Certain questions may call for subjective viewpoints or opinions, rather than objective facts. Quora is a suitable platform for soliciting diverse perspectives from different people, whereas search engines can sometimes present predominantly factual, objective information.

5. **Clarity and comprehension**: Some users may struggle to understand or interpret the raw information provided by search engines. In such cases, asking a question on Quora allows them to receive detailed explanations and examples. Quora's responses tend to be in a conversational format, which can make complex information more palatable and accessible.

6. **Up-to-date information**: Quora can also expedite access to information by providing users with the most recent updates and developments on a topic, as many users actively participate to share fresh insights. Conversely, search engines may occasionally offer outdated resources or information.

7. **Confirmation bias**: Lastly, it is possible that some users gravitate towards Quora to seek confirmation of their pre-existing beliefs. Engaging with others who share similar opinions can reinforce their convictions and provide them with a sense of validation.

In essence, while search engines are invaluable tools for swiftly delivering information, platforms like Quora offer the unique opportunity for users to engage with others, receive personalized answers, and foster a sense of community while learning. These different factors contribute to the popularity of Quora as a platform for asking questions that may be just as efficiently answered through search engines.
