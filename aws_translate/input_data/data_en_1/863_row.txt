It was more likely that Michael would get diabetes than Randy because Michael had a combination of risk factors, genetic predisposition, and lifestyle habits that significantly increased his likelihood of developing the condition.

Firstly, Michael's family had a strong history of type 2 diabetes. Both his parents and a few of his siblings were diagnosed with the condition in their adult years. Genetics plays a crucial role in determining an individual's susceptibility to diabetes, and a strong family history can considerably increase that risk.

Secondly, Michael's body mass index (BMI) had been consistently high since his teenage years. Obesity is a significant risk factor for type 2 diabetes. As a person's BMI increases, so does their risk of developing the disease. In Michael's case, his BMI was consistently over 30, putting him in the obese category and further increasing his chances of diabetes.

In addition, Michael led a predominantly sedentary lifestyle which contributed to his weight gain and overall health. He often took the elevator instead of the stairs, spent long hours in front of screens at work, and rarely engaged in physical exercise. A sedentary lifestyle can lead to insulin resistance, a condition in which the body is unable to utilize insulin properly. Insulin resistance is a significant contributor to the development of type 2 diabetes.

Poor dietary choices also put Michael at a higher risk of developing diabetes. He frequently indulged in high-calorie, high-carbohydrate, and high-fat foods, such as fast food, sugary snacks, and processed meals. These types of food can cause blood sugar levels to spike, putting additional stress on the body's insulin-producing cells. Over time, this can lead to the development of diabetes.

Moreover, Michael was a heavy smoker and engaged in excessive alcohol consumption. Both cigarette smoking and excessive alcohol intake are independent risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Smoking can lead to increased inflammation and oxidative stress, which can contribute to the development of insulin resistance. In the case of alcohol, excessive consumption can lead to weight gain, and it can also harm the pancreas, the organ responsible for producing insulin.

Contrastingly, Randy was at a lower risk for diabetes, as he led a healthier lifestyle. He maintained a healthy weight, engaged in regular physical activity, and his diet consisted of balanced meals with whole grains, lean proteins, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Moreover, Randy was a non-smoker and consumed alcohol in moderation. While he may not be entirely exempt from developing diabetes, his combination of genetic and lifestyle factors significantly reduced his likelihood in comparison to Michael.

In conclusion, Michael's increased likelihood of developing diabetes in comparison to Randy was due to a combination of genetic factors, an unhealthy diet, obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, and unhealthy habits such as smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. It is essential to recognize and manage these risk factors to prevent the onset of diabetes and maintain overall health and wellbeing.
