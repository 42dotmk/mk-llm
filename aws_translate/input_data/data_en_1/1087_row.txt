On February 23, 1836, the Mexican army, under the command of General Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna, set siege to the Alamo Mission, also known as the Mission San Antonio de Padua or simply The Alamo. This historic event took place in present-day San Antonio, Texas, which was then part of the Mexican state, Coahuila y Tejas. The siege marked one of the crucial moments in the Texas Revolution and is now a symbol of heroism and resistance against oppression for Texans and Americans.

The Alamo Mission was initially established as a Roman Catholic mission and fort by Spanish missionaries in the early 18th century. Over the years, it served various purposes, from being a religious outpost for spreading Christianity among the local Native American population to functioning as a military garrison.

In December 1835, Texian and Tejano volunteer forces successfully overtook the Mexican garrison stationed at the Alamo during the Battle of Bexar. Santa Anna, determined to reclaim the lost territory and quell the increasingly defiant Texian resistance, led a large Mexican army towards San Antonio. The Texians, comprised of a diverse mix of settlers, adventurers, and volunteers, were commanded by Colonel James Bowie and Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis. Among the ranks of the defenders was the famous frontiersman and former US Congressman, Davy Crockett.

On the morning of February 23, 1836, Santa Anna's troops reached San Antonio, and the siege of the Alamo began. The attackers raised a red flag signifying "no quarter," indicating that the enemy would not be taken captive but rather executed. The Texian forces defiantly retaliated by firing a cannon, demonstrating their determination not to surrender.

Facing a force of around 1,800 to 6,000 Mexican soldiers, the Texian defenders, numbering between 185 and 260, were vastly outnumbered. They held out for 13 days, fending off several assaults with limited supplies and resources. The defenders used the thick walls of the Alamo and firing from elevated positions to repel the attackers.

On the early morning of March 6, 1836, Santa Anna ordered a final, all-out assault on the Alamo. The Mexican soldiers scaled the walls and poured into the compound, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the exhausted defenders. The battle lasted about 90 minutes, culminating in the complete annihilation of the Alamo garrison.

Although the Battle of the Alamo resulted in a Mexican victory, it came at a considerable cost, with hundreds of Mexican soldiers killed or wounded. The heavy casualties weakened Santa Anna's forces, and the determined resistance of the Alamo defenders helped inspire more Texians and settlers to join the revolt against Mexico. Just over a month later, on April 21, 1836, the Texian forces led by General Sam Houston decisively defeated the Mexican army at the Battle of San Jacinto, ensuring the independence of Texas.

Today, the Alamo is a revered symbol of courage, patriotism, and the struggle for independence. It serves as a historical site and museum, drawing millions of visitors annually to learn about and remember those who fought and died during the siege.
