Option IV: The vacuum cleaner is now turned on and gets rolled across the carpet and the hardwood floors.

Once the person presses the two buttons on the vacuum cleaner, it springs to life, humming with the sound of its powerful motor. As the vacuum cleaner is now turned on, the person grips the handle firmly and begins to guide it across the various floor surfaces in the living space, including carpets and hardwood floors.

Starting with the carpeted areas, the person moves the vacuum cleaner back and forth methodically, ensuring that every inch is covered. The vacuum cleaner's brushes work diligently, reaching deep into the carpet fibers to extract dust, dirt, hair, and other debris that has become embedded over time. As the vacuum sucks up the particles, they are deposited into the vacuum cleaner's dustbin or bag, depending on its design.

The person continues to guide the vacuum cleaner throughout the room, carefully navigating around furniture and other obstacles. Utilizing various attachments, such as crevice tools and upholstery brushes, the person makes sure to clean in and around these harder-to-reach areas. This helps to provide a thorough and comprehensive clean, removing allergens and health hazards that could accumulate in the environment over time.

After finishing with the carpeted areas, the person transitions to the hardwood floors. Before proceeding, they might need to adjust the vacuum cleaner settings or change the brush roll to ensure that it is suitable for cleaning hard surfaces. Once prepared, the vacuum cleaner is guided across the hardwood floors, picking up dirt, dust, and debris in its path. Additionally, interlocking bristles sweep along edges and corners, removing more particles that could have escaped from the vacuum's suction area.

Special care is taken not to scratch or damage the hardwood surfaces, as they are sensitive to abrasive materials and can be scratched easily. For this reason, the person might need to ensure that the vacuum cleaner's wheels and brushes are in good condition, and that they are free from any sharp or abrasive debris that could damage the floor.

Throughout the entire process, the person may occasionally check the vacuum cleaner's dustbin or bag to ensure that it isn't full. If it is, they would need to empty or replace it to maintain the vacuum cleaner's efficiency and performance. This helps to prevent the vacuum from becoming overburdened and losing suction power during the cleaning process.

Once the person is satisfied with the thoroughness of their vacuuming efforts, they turn off the machine by pressing the two buttons once again. They may also unplug the vacuum cleaner from the power outlet, if necessary. Finally, the vacuum cleaner is stored away, ready to tackle any cleaning challenges that the future may hold.

In conclusion, when the person presses the two buttons on the vacuum cleaner, it leads to a comprehensive and thorough cleaning process of the carpeted and hardwood floor surfaces in the living space. The vacuum cleaner not only removes dirt and debris, but also helps to improve the overall health and hygiene of the environment.
