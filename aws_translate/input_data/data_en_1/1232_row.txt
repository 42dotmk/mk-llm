In order to get rid of a wild rose bush, you need to combine both chemical and physical methods. You will first have to choose an appropriate weed killer, specifically chemical weed killers that contain glyphosate. Glyphosate is an active ingredient in many herbicides, and it works by inhibiting an enzyme involved in the production of amino acids crucial to plant growth. However, glyphosate is a non-selective herbicide, meaning it will kill most plants it comes into contact with â€” not just the wild rose bush. Therefore, when using such a weed killer, it is important to be precise and careful to avoid damaging other surrounding plants you wish to keep.

To properly use the weed killer, make sure you read the instructions and follow them accurately. Safety should be your priority; therefore, wear protective clothing to avoid skin contact with the glyphosate. Generally, this will involve mixing a specific amount of the weed killer with water in a spray bottle or larger sprayer. This mixture is then applied directly to the leaves and stems of the wild rose bush. 

The best time to apply the weed killer is when the rose bush is actively growing, usually in late spring or early summer. This is when the plant will absorb the most glyphosate and effectively transport it to the roots, which will ensure a thorough extermination of the plant.

However, you should be aware that some chemical weed killers can linger in the soil, posing potential risks to any future plants that you may wish to cultivate in the formerly infested area. Therefore, choose your weed killer carefully if you plan to replant in this area soon, or consider using a glyphosate-free alternative.

Physical methods can also be applied to help kill the wild rose bush. For instance, you can place mulch around the area to prevent the plant from obtaining the sunlight it needs for photosynthesis. Moreover, you can manually dig around the area using a shovel or garden fork to remove the plant's root system, which will help stop it from spreading. To effectively do this, dig a hole that's approximately 12 inches (30 cm) deep around the bush.

Further, if you're concerned about the possibility of mature stems rotting, you can try using a homeopathic weed killer as an alternative. These are usually made with natural ingredients like vinegar or citrus oil, which help to kill the wild rose bush without causing harm to the environment.

And lastly, remember to do this process preferably in late summer when the wild rose bush's growth slows down. This will help ensure a more effective extermination process. Furthermore, the selection of a weed killer effective for use on woody plants like the wild rose bush is essential. Not all herbicides are designed to kill such types of plants effectively; therefore, you need to check whether the one you choose is suitable for the task.

To sum up, getting rid of a wild rose bush requires careful selection and use of a weed killer combined with physical removal methods. It's a task that needs precision, patience, and the right resources, but with careful management and the right approach, your garden can be free of the wild rose bush.
