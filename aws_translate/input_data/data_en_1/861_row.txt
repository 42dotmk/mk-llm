Yes, the supposed perturbation--in this case, the increased imposition of force on rocks--can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of mineral formation. The discussion requires an understanding of the basic geological processes of mineral formation, which are indeed affected by the pressure exerted on the rocks.

First, let's overview the processes you've mentioned. 

1. Magma cools inside the crust: Minerals can form deep within the Earth's crust where temperatures and pressures are high. This process produces igneous rocks, such as granite and basalt, which contain various minerals. When magma cools slowly underground, the crystals have a longer time to grow and become larger. 

2. Magma crystallizes: As the magma slowly cools, elements within it begin to chemically combine, forming minerals. The rate of crystallization and the specific minerals formed are determined by the chemical composition of the magma, temperature, and pressure.

3. Lava cools on the surface: Lava, or magma that has reached the surface of the Earth, cools much faster than magma underground, giving the minerals less time to crystallize. This results in smaller crystals and the formation of extrusive igneous rocks, like basalt and obsidian.

4. Lava crystallizes: As the lava cools, its elements chemically coalesce into minerals, creating a rock with tiny crystals.

5. Minerals dissolve in water and crystallize: This forms sedimentary rock. When water evaporates or changing conditions cause mineral-saturated water to become supersaturated, mineral crystals can precipitate.

Now, let's explore how increased imposition of force can impact these processes. 

Direct Effect: The direct effect refers to the literal change in the physical environment in which the rocks are situated. Greater force can translate into increased pressure. When we discuss an increased imposition of force, we're intrinsically discussing an increased pressure system that would, in turn, influence the rate and type of mineral formation. 

Minerals forming deep within Earthâ€™s crust under high pressure would respond differently to this change than those subjected to low pressures at or near the Earth's surface. Higher pressures generally lead to minerals with more compact structures. This can influence some transitions from one mineral type to another. For example, graphite under very high pressure can transform into diamond. 

Indirect Effect: Indirect effects could be seen as changes in geochemical cycles or shifts in further physical or chemical conditions due to the increased force. Increased pressures can indirectly affect the nature and degree of metamorphism occurring in metamorphic rocks, as the minerals within the rocks react to the changes in pressure and temperature. Changes in pressure can also alter the solubility of water in magma, possibly causing it to crystallize more quickly and alter the types of minerals that form.

Therefore, more frequent applications of force on rocks will cause the physical conditions of mineral formation to change, leading to potential differences in the types and qualities of the minerals formed.
