[Question]The seats of a bus are arranged in 23 rows of 4 seats. At the start, 16 people climb. At the first stop, 15 people board the bus and 3 get off. At the second stop, 17 people get on the bus and 10 get off. How many empty seats are there after the second stop?
[Answer]There are 23 * 4 = 92 seats on this bus. After the first stop, there are 16 + 15 - 3 = 28 people on the bus. After the 2nd stop, there are 28 + 17 - 10 = 35 people on the bus. So there are 92 - 35 = 57 empty seats on the bus after the 2nd stop. The answer is 57.

Question: In a graveyard, there are 20 skeletons. Half of these skeletons are adult women, and the remaining number are split evenly between adult men and children. If an adult woman has 20 bones in their body, and a male has 5 more than this, and a child has half as many as an adult woman, how many bones are in the graveyard?
Answer: We first need to figure out how many of each type of skeleton there are. Since half the 20 skeletons are adult women, that means there are 20 / 2 = 10 adult women's skeletons. The remaining half, 10, is split between adult men and children, meaning there are 10 / 2 = 5 of each. Since an adult woman has 20 bones in their body, this means that the 10 skeletons have 20 * 10 = 200 bones in total. Since an adult man has 5 more bones in their body than an adult woman, this means they have 20 + 5 = 25 bones in their body. There are 5 adult men, meaning there are 25 * 5 = 125 bones in the adult male skeletons in total. Since a child has half as many bones as the 20 in an adult woman, this means the children have 20 / 2 = 10 bones in their body. Since there are 5 children, this means there are 5 * 10 = 50 bones in the children's skeletons in total. Therefore, altogether there are 50 + 125 + 200 = 375 bones in total in the graveyard. The answer is 375.
