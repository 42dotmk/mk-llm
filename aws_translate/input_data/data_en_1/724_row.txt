It does not directly follow that "Click to read the question, which is about a guy named Bill, said the website," because there is not enough context to fully understand the scenario. However, from the given context, we can infer that the question is related to a situation where two individuals named Bill had different outcomes in discouraging unwanted pursuit by a woman named Janet.

To provide a detailed and long answer, let's dive deeper into possible reasons for the difference in outcomes.

1. Communication Style: One Bill might have been more effective in communicating his disinterest when encountering Janet's pursuit. Clear and direct communication is essential in these circumstances. This Bill may have expressed his lack of interest in a way that left no room for ambiguity, ensuring Janet would not persist with her pursuit.

2. Persistence: In contrast, the other Bill might have been less successful in discouraging Janet due to her persistence. Sometimes people do not take a hint or give up easily, leading to continued unwanted pursuit.

3. Personality Differences: People's personalities could have played a significant role in the effectiveness of each Bill's attempt to discourage Janet. One Bill's personality may have aligned more closely with Janet's, making it harder for her to let go of her pursuit, whereas the other Bill may have had a personality that clashed or did not resonate with Janet's, making it easier for her to accept his disinterest.

4. Initial Attraction Level: The level of initial attraction could have influenced the effectiveness of each Bill's attempt to discourage Janet. The Bill who was initially less attractive to Janet might have had an easier time convincing her to relinquish her pursuit, while the other Bill, who was more attractive to Janet, may have had a harder time getting her to back off.

5. Social Circle and Environment: Different social environments and the presence or absence of mutual friends can also impact the effectiveness of discouraging unwanted pursuit. One Bill may have been in a social setting where it was easier to avoid or navigate away from Janet's pursuit, while the other Bill could have found himself consistently in close proximity to Janet due to overlapping social circles or other factors.

6. Timing: Timing can play a crucial role in the success of discouraging unwanted pursuit. One Bill may have communicated his disinterest at an opportune time when Janet was more emotionally equipped to handle the rejection, while the other Bill may have expressed his disinterest when Janet was more vulnerable or emotionally invested, making it difficult for her to accept and move on.

In conclusion, it does not follow directly that "Click to read the question, which is about a guy named Bill, said the website," as the context provided is limited. However, based on the context given, we can hypothesize that there are various factors, such as communication style, personality differences, initial attraction level, social environment, and timing, that have influenced the success of each Bill's attempts to discourage unwanted pursuit by Janet.
