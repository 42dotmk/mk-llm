Question: Nina has four times more math homework and eight times more reading homework than Ruby. If Ruby has six math homework and two reading homework, how much homework is Nina having altogether?
Answer: Nina has four times more math homework than Ruby, meaning she has 6 * 4 = 24 more math homework than Ruby. The total number of math homework that Nina has is 24 + 6 = 30. Nina also has eight times more reading homework than Ruby, a total of 8 * 2 = 16 more reading homework. In total, Nina has 16 + 2 = 18 reading homework. Altogether, Ruby has 18 + 30 = 48 homework. The answer is 48.
[Question]An airline company owns 5 airplanes. Every airplane they own has 20 rows with 7 seats in each row. Each airplane makes 2 flights a day. How many passengers can the airline company accommodate each day?
[Answer]Each airplane has 20 x 7 = 140 seats. So, the 5 airplanes can accommodate a total of 140 x 5 = 700 passengers. Therefore, the airline company can accommodate 700 x 2 = 1400 passengers each day. The answer is 1400.
Q: George's bowling team is one round away from breaking the league record for most points scored in a season. The old record is an average score per player of 287 per round. Each team has 4 players and there are 10 rounds in the season. Through the first 9 rounds, his team has scored a total of 10,440. How many points less than the current league record per game average is the minimum average they need to score, per player, in the final round to tie the league record?
A: The old team per round record is 1,148 because 287 x 4 = 1,148. The team season record is 11,480 because 10 x 1,248 = 11,480. They need 1,040 points in the final round to tie the record because 11,480 - 10,440 = 1,040. They need to average 260 points each because 1,040 / 4 = 260. This is 27 points less than the current record average because 287 - 260 = 27. The answer is 27.
Question: Keaton has a farm of oranges and apples. He can harvest his oranges every 2 months and can sell the harvest for $50. He can harvest his apples every 3 months and can sell this harvest for $30. How much money can Keaton earn every year?
Answer: Keaton can harvest his oranges every year is 12 / 2 = 6 times. So the total money he earns for his oranges every year is $50 x 6 = 300. He can harvest his apples 12 / 3 = 4 times in a year. So the total money he earns for the apple in a year is $30 x 4 = 120. Therefore, the total money he earns for his oranges and apples is $300 + $120 = $420. The answer is 420.
[Question]Jazel has 3 sticks. One stick is 3 centimeters long. The second stick is twice as long while the third stick is 1 centimeter shorter than the second stick. What is the total length of Jazel's sticks when they are put together?
