Memories of Remy running through Aubrey's mind after his death would likely evoke a complex mixture of emotions for Aubrey. It is essential to note that every person's grief and coping mechanisms are unique. However, given the close relationship between Aubrey and Remy, some common feelings that might arise are:

1. Sadness: The most immediate and intense emotion Aubrey would experience upon reminiscing about Remy would be profound sadness. The realization that Remy is no longer around to share new memories, moments of joy, or even mundane daily exchanges would be overwhelming. This feeling may intensify when recalling favorite memories and the special qualities that made Remy a significant person in Aubrey's life.

2. Regret: Aubrey might feel regret for moments or opportunities missed with Remy. This could be reflecting on chances to express their feelings or appreciation, to say sorry, or to clear misunderstandings. It is not uncommon for people to wish they had "one more moment" with a loved one to convey these sentiments.

3. Guilt: Guilt might arise if Aubrey feels responsible for Remy's death, or if there were unresolved conflicts between them before Remy's passing. Even if not directly related to the cause of death, Aubrey might blame themselves for not being there or not taking better care of Remy.

4. Nostalgia: As memories resurface, Aubrey may feel a sense of nostalgia and longing for the past. This could manifest in reminiscing about the good times they shared, recalling Remy's mannerisms, inside jokes, and unique traits that provided happiness and comfort to their relationship.

5. Anger: It is not uncommon for grief to be accompanied by feelings of anger or frustration. Aubrey might feel anger towards the circumstances that led to Remy's death or even towards Remy for leaving them behind. This anger can be challenging to reconcile, as it might be conflicting with other emotions such as love and sadness.

6. Loneliness: Losing someone close often leads to loneliness, as the person who filled a significant role in one's life is no longer there. Aubrey could feel isolated in their grief, even when surrounded by others, as the unique bond with Remy cannot be replicated.

7. Gratitude: Amid the pain, Aubrey might also feel gratitude for the times they shared and the memories that Remy left behind. This could serve as a reminder of the cherished moments and the positive impact Remy had on their life.

8. Acceptance: Over time, as Aubrey heals and learns to cope with the loss, they may come to accept Remy's passing. This acceptance does not erase the pain but may help Aubrey find a new way of holding onto the memories and honoring Remy's life without being entirely consumed by grief.

While it is crucial to understand these potential emotions, it is equally important to remember that the grieving process is not linear and may involve Aubrey experiencing different emotions at various times. Ultimately, how Aubrey feels after Remy's death will depend on factors such as their personal coping mechanisms, the support system available, and the circumstances surrounding Remy's passing.
