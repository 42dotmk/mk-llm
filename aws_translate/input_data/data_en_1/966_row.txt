Q: Olaf collects colorful toy cars. At first, his collection consisted of 150 cars. His family, knowing his hobby, decided to give him some toy cars. Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle. Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum. Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, 1 more than the uncle. How many toy cars does Olaf have in total, after receiving all these gifts?
A: Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,. Mom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = 15 toy cars. Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,. Uncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = 5 toy cars. Grandpa gave Olaf 2 * 5 = 10 toy cars. All the family together gave Olaf 10 + 15 + 6 + 5 + 10 = 46. Adding the cars Olaf already had, Olaf's collection has 150 + 46 = 196 cars. The answer is 196.
Question: Max has a collection of stamps in three colors: 20 red stamps, 80 blue stamps and 7 yellow ones. He is trying to sell the whole collection. He already sold 20 red stamps for the price of $1.1 for each stamp and 80 blue stamps for the price of $0.8 for each stamp. What price did he need to set for each yellow stamp to be able to earn the total of $100 from the whole sale?
Answer: Max earned 20 * 1.1 = $22 on red stamps. From the blue stamps Max got 80 * 0.8 = $64. His earnings so far are 22 + 64 = $86. To earn $100 he needs 100 â€“ 86 = $14 more. Max has 7 yellow stamps, so he needs to set the price at 14 / 7 = $2. The answer is 2.
[Question]Tom receives a $12 allowance per month. In the first week, he spends a third of it; in the second week, he spends a quarter of what he has left. How much money does he have left to finish the month?
[Answer]The first week he spends: $12 * 1 / 3 = $4. So he has $12 - $4 = $8 left. In the second week, he spends $8 x 1 / 4 = $2. So Tom has $8 - $2 = $6 left to finish the month. The answer is 6.
Q: John weighs one-quarter times more than what Mary weighs. Mary weighs 20 lbs less than Jamison's weight. If Mary weighs 160 lbs, what's the combined weight of the three?
A: If Mary weighs 160 lbs, Jamison weighs 160 lbs + 20 lbs = 180 lbs. If John weighs one - quarter less than what Mary weighs, he weighs 1 / 4 * 160 lbs = 40 lbs more. The total weight of John is 160 lbs + 40 lbs = 200 lbs. The total weight for the three is 200 lbs + 180 lbs + 160 lbs = 540 lbs. The answer is 540.
Question: I have purchased 5 blue apples at the store. Suppose my neighbor gives me twice as many yellow apples as I have blue ones, and then I give my son 1/5 of the total number of apples; how many apples do I have now?
Answer: The number of blue apples is 5, and if you receive twice as many yellow apples as the number of blue apples, there will be 5 * 2 = 10 yellow apples. After receiving the yellow apples, you now have 10 yellow apples + 5 blue apples = 15 apples. When you give 1 / 5 of the total number of apples to the son, you part with 1 / 5 * 15 = 3 apples. The total number of apples remaining is 15 - 3 = 12 apples. The answer is 12.
