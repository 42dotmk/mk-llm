The missing first step of the given process is the formation of a massive star.

The detailed process with the missing first step included is as follows:

1. Formation of a massive star: The first step in the process is the formation of a massive star. Stars are formed within clouds of gas and dust, known as nebulae, which are located throughout galaxies. Through gravitational attraction, the gas and dust start to clump together, forming a dense region known as a protostar. As the protostar continues to accumulate mass, its core becomes increasingly dense and hot. Once the core reaches a high enough temperature and pressure, nuclear fusion begins, converting hydrogen into helium and releasing energy in the form of radiation. This marks the transition from a protostar to a main-sequence star.

2. The star burns until it runs out of fuel: During its main-sequence phase, the star remains in a stable state, with its internal pressure and gravity balancing each other. This stage can last billions of years, depending on the mass of the star. Ultimately, though, the star exhausts its hydrogen fuel and can no longer maintain the fusion process.

3. The star can no longer support its weight: As the hydrogen fuel is depleted, the star's core contracts, and the remaining outer layers expand due to the increased temperature. This causes the star to transform into a red giant.

4. The layers of hydrogen press down on the core: With the star's core contracting, the outer hydrogen layers start pressing down on it.

5. The core gets smaller and smaller under the pressure: The pressure exerted by the outer layers causes the core to shrink further, increasing its temperature and density.

6. The pressure causes gravity to get stronger: Due to the increased density and smaller size, the gravitational force acting on the core becomes stronger.

7. The gravity becomes so powerful that nothing can escape it: Eventually, the gravitational force becomes so strong that it overcomes the outward pressure from the core. When this happens, the core collapses under its own gravity, resulting in an explosion called a supernova.

8. Anything that gets close to it is drawn into it by its gravity: The remnants of the core that are left behind after the supernova form a dense region in space called a neutron star or, if the original star was large enough, a black hole. In the case of a black hole, the gravitational force is so strong that not even light can escape from it.

9. Light is drawn into it: If the remnant becomes a black hole, its gravitational pull is so powerful that it bends light towards it, trapping it within its event horizon, the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the black hole's gravity.

10. Light cannot escape: Once light or any other form of radiation or matter crosses the event horizon, it is lost forever within the black hole, as escape requires an infinite amount of energy.

In summary, the missing first step in the given process is the formation of a massive star from a nebula, which eventually leads to the birth of a black hole when the star exhausts its nuclear fuel and undergoes a supernova explosion.
