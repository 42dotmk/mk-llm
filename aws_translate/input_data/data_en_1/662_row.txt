Question: Janet takes two multivitamins and 3 calcium supplements every day for the first 2 weeks of the month. For the last two weeks of the month, she runs low on calcium supplements and only takes one per day. How many pills does Janet take in that month?
Answer: First find the number of pills Janet takes every day for the first 2 weeks: 2 pills / day + 3 pills / day = 5 pills / day. Then find the number of days in 2 weeks: 2 weeks * 7 days / week = 14 days. Then multiply that number by the number of pills she takes daily to find the total number of pills she takes in the first 2 weeks: 5 pills / day * 14 days = 70 pills. Then find the number of pills Janet takes every day for the last 2 weeks: 2 pills / day + 1 pill / day = 3 pills / day. Then multiply that number by the number of days in 2 weeks to find the total number of pills she takes in the last 2 weeks: 3 pills / day * 14 days = 42 pills. Then add the number of pills she took in the first and last two weeks to find the total number of pills she took: 42 pills + 70 pills = 112 pills. The answer is 112.
[Question]Two buses leave a pick-up point station with 60% and 70% of capacity full, respectively. If the people in the buses are all employees of a company, and the buses have a capacity of 150, calculate the total number of the employees in the two buses combined?
[Answer]If the first bus is 60% full, it has 60 / 100 * 150 = 90 passengers. The second bus is 70% full, meaning it has 70 / 100 * 150 = 105 passengers. The total number of people in the two buses is 105 + 90 = 195. The answer is 195.
Q: Peter is buying a set of glasses. They cost $3 for small glasses and $5 for large ones. He has $50. If he buys 8 small ones and leaves with $1 in change, how many large ones did he buy?
A: He spent $49 on glasses because 50 - 49 = 1. He spent $24 on small glasses because 8x3 = 24. He spent $25 on large glasses because 49 - 24 = 25. He bought 5 large glasses because 25 / 5 = 5. The answer is 5.
