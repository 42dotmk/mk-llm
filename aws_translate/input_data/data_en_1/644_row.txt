Q: Tony decided he wanted to be an astronaut. He went to college for 4 years to get a degree in science. He then went on to get 2 more degrees in other fields for the same period of time. He also got a graduate degree in physics, which took another 2 years. How many years in total did Tony go to school to be an astronaut?
A: Tony got 3 degrees which each took 4 years, for 3 * 4 = 12 years spent. He then got his graduate degree, which was another 2 years added to the previous total, for 12 + 2 = 14 years in total. The answer is 14.
Question: Sonja makes her own peanut butter with peanuts and oil in a blender. She uses a ratio of two ounces of oil to smooth out every eight ounces of peanuts. Her last batch of peanut butter weighed 20 ounces. How many ounces of oil did she use?
Answer: Sonja uses 2 ounces of oil for 8 ounces of peanuts to make 2 + 8 = 10 ounces of peanut butter. Her last batch weighed 20 ounces, so she made 20 / 10 = 2 times her ratio. Thus, she used 2 * 2 = 4 ounces of oil. The answer is 4.
[Question]The school band has 30 songs in their repertoire. The band played 5 songs in their first set and 7 in their second set. The band will play 2 songs for their encore. Assuming the band plays through their entire repertoire, how many songs will they play on average in the third and fourth sets?
[Answer]The band played 5 + 7 = 12 songs in their first two sets. They have 30 - 12 = 18 songs left for the third set, fourth set and encore. Since they played 2 songs in the encore, they have 18 - 2 = 16 songs to play on the third and fourth sets. They will play 16 / 2 = 8 songs on average over the third and fourth sets. The answer is 8.
Q: Carla needs to drive her car to do a bunch of errands. She needs to drive 8 miles to the grocery store, 6 miles to pick up her kids from school, 12 miles to drop her kids off at soccer practice, and twice the distance from the school to soccer practice to get everyone home again. If Carla's car gets 25 miles per gallon, and gas costs $2.50, how much will Carla have to spend on gas for her trip?
A: First find the distance between soccer practice and home by multiplying the distance between soccer practice and school by 2: 12 miles * 2 = 24 miles. Then find the total distance Carla drives by adding the length of each trip: 24 miles + 12 miles + 6 miles + 8 miles = 50 miles. Then find how many gallons of gas she needs by dividing the distance of the trip by her car's gas mileage: 50 miles / 25 mpg = 2 gallons. Then multiple the gallons of gas by the price per gallon to find the total cost: 2 gallons * $2.50 = $5. The answer is 5.
