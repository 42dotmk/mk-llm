Q: Sabrina went to the library and found a historical series novel called The Rangers Apprentice. There are 14 books in the series, and each book has 200 pages. She read four books in a month and half the number of books remaining in the second month. What's the total number of pages Sabrina has to read to finish the whole series?
A: The total number of pages in the series is 14 books * 200 pages / book = 2800 pages. Sabrina read 4 books * 200 pages / book = 800 pages in the first month. She still has 14 books - 4 books = 10 books after reading four books. In the second month, she read 1 / 2 * 10 books = 5 books. The total number of pages she read is 5 books * 200 pages / book = 1000 in the second month. In total, Sabrina 1000 pages + 800 pages = 1800 pages in two months. Sabrina has to read 2800 pages - 1800 pages = 1000 more pages to complete the total series. The answer is 1000.
Question: Grace is filling her pool in the backyard with a hose that sprays 50 gallons/hour. She waited for 3 hours but the pool wasn't full, so she decides to add another hose that sprays 70 gallons/hour, and after 2 more hours the pool is full. How much water can Graceâ€™s pool contain?
Answer: In the first 3 hours the pool gets 50 gallons / hour x 3 hours = 150 gallons. With the addition of the other hose, the pool was filling with a rate of 50 gallons / hour + 70 gallons / hour = 120 gallons / hour. In the next 2 hours with both hoses the pool gets 120 gallons / hour x 2 hours = 240 gallons. The pool's total capacity is 240 gallons + 150 gallons = 390 gallons. The answer is 390.
[Question]Bruce buys 5 packs of crayons at $5 each, 10 books at $5 each, and 3 calculators at $5 each. If he has $200, how many bags can he buy with the change if one costs $10 each?
[Answer]He pays 5 * 5 = $25 for buying crayons. He pays 10 * 5 = $50 for buying books. He pays 3 * 5 = $15 for buying calculators. The change he has for buying bags is 200 - 25 - 50 - 15 = $110. The number of bags he can buy is 110 / 10 = 11 bags. The answer is 11.
Q: The flowers cost $9, the clay pot costs $20 more than the flower, and the bag of soil costs $2 less than the flower. How much does it cost to plant the flowers?

Question: In a grocery store, Julia bought 2 pieces of Snickers and 3 packs of M&M's. If each piece of Snickers costs $1.5 and a pack of M&M's has the same cost as 2 Snickers, how much is Julia's change if she gave the cashier 2 $10 bills?
Answer: Two pieces of snickers cost $1.5 x 2 = $3. One pack of M&M's costs $3 so 3 packs cost $3 x 3 = $9. The total amount that she needs to pay is $3 + $9 = $12. Julia gave the cashier $10 x 2 = $20. So, her change is $20 - $12 = $8. The answer is 8.
