Q: Alice needs to sell $1000 of shoes to meet her quota. Adidas cost $45, Nike cost $60, and Reeboks cost $35. If she sells 8 Nikes, 6 Adidas's, and 9 Reeboks, how much is she short or above her goal?
A: The total dollar amount of Nike's sold is 8 * $60 = $480. The total dollar amount of Adidas's sold is 6 * $45 = $270. The total dollar amount of Reebok's sold is 9 * $35 = $315. The total dollar amount that Alice sold was $480 + $270 + $315 = $1065. Therefore, she sold above her goal by $1065 - $1000 = $65. The answer is 65.
Question: Claire won a $100 gift card to her favorite coffee shop. She wants to treat herself to a latte that cost $3.75 and a croissant for $3.50 every morning for a week. She also plans to buy 5 cookies that cost $1.25 each. How much money will be left on her card after a week of coffee and pastry?
Answer: Every day she buys $3.75 latte and $3.50 croissant for a total of 3.75 + 3.50 = $7.25 per day. If she spends $7.25 a day for 7 days she will spend 7.25 * 7 = $50.75 in one week. If she buys 5 cookies at $1.25 each she will spend 5 * 1.25 = $6.25. Her gift card is for $100 and she spends $50.75 and an additional $6.25 that will leave her with 100 - 50.75 - 6.25 = $43.00 on her gift card. The answer is 43.

Q: Brian is taping up some boxes. Each box needs three pieces of tape, one as long as the long side and two as long as the short side. If Brian tapes up 5 boxes that measure 15 inches by 30 inches and 2 boxes that measure 40 inches square, how much tape does he need?
A: First find the amount of tape each 15 in x 30 in box needs on the short sides: 2 sides * 15 inches / side = 30 inches. Then add that to the amount of tape each 15 in x 30 in box needs on the long side to find the total amount needed per box: 30 inches + 30 inches = 60 inches. Then multiply that amount by 5 boxes to find the total amount needed: 60 inches / box * 5 boxes = 300 inches. Then find the amount of tape each 40 in x 40 in box needs for its three equal length sides: 3 sides * 40 inches / side = 120 inches. Then multiply that amount by 2 boxes to find the total amount needed: 120 inches / box * 2 boxes = 240 inches. Then add the total amount needed for each box size to find the grand total: 240 inches + 300 inches = 540 inches. The answer is 540.
