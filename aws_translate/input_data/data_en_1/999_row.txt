[Question]Barry wants to make a huge salad using only cucumbers and tomatoes. He will use a total of 280 pieces of vegetables. If there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers, how many cucumbers will be used in the salad?
[Answer]Let c be the number of cucumbers and t the number of tomatoes. The total is the sum of the number of cucumbers and that of tomatoes, which is c + t = 280 piece of vegetables. Since there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers, this means c = t / 3. Therefore 3 * c = t. The sum will therefore be c + 3 * c = 280 pieces of vegetables. This means that 4 * c = 280 vegetables. Therefore c = 280 / 4 = 70 cucumbers. The answer is 70.
Q: Lionel went to the grocery store and bought 14 boxes of Graham crackers and 15 packets of Oreos. To make an Oreo cheesecake, Lionel needs 2 boxes of Graham crackers and 3 packets of Oreos. After making the maximum number of Oreo cheesecakes he can with the ingredients he bought, how many boxes of Graham crackers would he have left over?
A: Lionel has enough Graham crackers to make 14 / 2 = 7 Oreo cheesecakes. Lionel has enough Oreos to make 15 / 3 = 5 Oreo cheesecakes. Therefore, the maximum number of cheesecakes Lionel can make is 5. Lionel needs 2 * 5 = 10 boxes of Graham crackers to make 4 cheesecakes. He'll have 14 - 10 = 4 boxes left over. The answer is 4.

[Question]Laura loves to cook. One day she decided to make dinner for her family. She bought the necessary ingredients for this occasion: two salads, 2 kilograms of beef, 1 kilogram of potatoes, and two liters of juice. One salad costs $3, and one kilogram of beef is two times more expensive. One kilogram of potatoes costs one-third of the price of one salad, and one liter of juice is $1.5. How much did Laura need to pay for all the products she bought?
[Answer]Laura bought two salads, for 2 * 3 = $6. One kilogram of beef is two times more expensive than one salad, which means it cost 2 * 3 = $6. So Laura spend 2 * 6 = $12 on beef. One kilogram of potatoes costs only 3 * 1 / 3 = $1, and that's how much Laura paid for potatoes. Laura bought two liters of juice, so she did spend on them 2 * 1.5 = $3. So in total Laura paid 6 + 12 + 1 + 3 = $22. The answer is 22.
