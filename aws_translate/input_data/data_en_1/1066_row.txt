Q: Last year, the school library purchased 50 new books. This year, it purchased 3 times as many books. If the library had 100 books before it purchased new books last year, how many books are in the library now?
A: Last year, there were a total of 100 + 50 = 150 books in the library. The library purchased 50 x 3 = 150 books this year. Therefore, the library now has a total of 150 + 150 = 300 books. The answer is 300.
Question: $240 was divided between Kelvin and Samuel. Samuel received 3/4 of the money. From his share, Samuel then spent 1/5 of the original $240 on drinks. How much does Samuel have left?
Answer: Samuel received 3 / 4 of $240, which is $240 * (3 / 4) = $180. He spent 1 / 5 of $240, which is $240 * (1 / 5) = $48. He spent this amount from his own share, so he has $180 - $48 = $132 left. The answer is 132.
[Question]Vivian plays 10 Spotify songs every day. Her best friend Clara plays 2 fewer songs each day. If in June they didn't play any song during the weekends only, and there were 8 weekend days in June, what's the total number of songs they both listened to in that month?
[Answer]June has 30 days, so if they didn't play any songs on weekends, then they played 30 days - 8 days = 22 days. If Vivian played 10 songs each day, the total number of songs she played for the month is 10 songs / day * 22 days = 220 songs. Clara played 2 fewer songs, which is 10 songs / day - 2 songs / day = 8 songs / day. The total number of songs played by Clara for the whole month is 8 songs / day * 22 days = 176 songs. The total played by both is 220 songs + 176 songs = 396 songs. The answer is 396.
Q: The average temperature in Orlando in a particular week was 60 degrees. If the temperature on each of the first 3 days in that week was 40, and the temperature for Thursday and Friday was 80 degrees each, calculate the total temperature of the remaining days of that week.
A: If the average temperature of Orlando for the week was 60, then the total temperature for the week was 7 * 60 = 420 degrees. For the first three days of that week, the temperature was 40 degrees each day, totaling 3 * 40 = 120 degrees in the three days. The temperature for Thursday and Friday was 80 degrees each, a total of 80 * 2 = 160 degrees. The temperature of Orlando for the first five days was 160 + 120 = 280 degrees. The temperature for the remaining two days is 420 - 280 = 140 degrees. The answer is 140.
Question: Phil and Andre decide to order some pizza. They get a small cheese and a large pepperoni. The small pizza has 8 slices, The large has 14 slices. They have both eaten 9 slices already. How many pieces are left per person?
Answer: There are 22 pieces of pizza because 14 plus 8 equals 22. They have eaten 18 pieces of pizza because 9 plus 9 equals 18. There are 4 pieces of pizza left because 22 minus 18 equals 4. There are 2 pieces per person because 4 divided by 2 equals 2. The answer is 2.
