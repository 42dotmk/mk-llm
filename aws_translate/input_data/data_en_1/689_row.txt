Title: DIY Activated Charcoal: A Step-by-Step Guide using Calcium Chloride and Alternative Solutions

Introduction

Activated charcoal is an incredibly versatile and beneficial substance that is widely used for various applications, from water filtration to detoxification and even as an emergency treatment for certain types of poisoning. It is produced by treating regular charcoal with specific chemicals or high temperatures to "activate" it, increasing its surface area and porosity, which enhances its capability to absorb impurities. This article will provide a step-by-step guide to creating activated charcoal at home using calcium chloride as well as alternative solutions such as bleach and lemon juice.

Step 1: Prepare the Calcium Chloride Solution

Begin by combining calcium chloride with water in a 1:3 ratio. This means for every part of calcium chloride, you will need three parts of water (e.g., one cup of calcium chloride to three cups of water). Mix the calcium chloride and water until the calcium chloride dissolves completely in the water. This solution is vital as it will help to activate the charcoal in the steps that follow.

Step 2: Alternative to Calcium Chloride Solutions

If calcium chloride is unavailable or if you prefer not to use it, there are alternative solutions that can be utilized. Both bleach and lemon juice can serve as substitutes for the calcium chloride solution. Keep in mind that the alternative solution will also need to be mixed with water.

Step 3: Combine the Calcium Chloride Solution with Charcoal Powder

Next, prepare a charcoal powder by grinding regular charcoal (e.g., from a charcoal briquette) using a mortar and pestle or a coffee grinder. Once you have obtained a fine powder, transfer it into a bowl large enough to accommodate both the powder and the calcium chloride solution (or alternative solution). Gently stir the two components together until the charcoal powder is completely saturated with the calcium chloride solution.

Step 4: Let the Charcoal Sit

Cover the bowl containing the charcoal mixture with a plate or lid to protect it from contaminants. Allow the mixture to rest undisturbed for a full 24 hours. During this time, the chemical reactions between the solution and the charcoal will further activate the charcoal's properties.

Step 5: Cook the Charcoal

After the resting period, the charcoal will need to be cooked for an additional 3 hours to complete the activation process. Preheat your oven to a low temperature, around 215°F (100°C), and spread the charcoal mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Once the oven is preheated, place the baking sheet inside and allow the charcoal to cook for the entire 3 hours.

Conclusion

Finally, remove the activated charcoal from the oven and let it cool completely. Your DIY activated charcoal is now ready for use in various applications such as water filtration, detoxification masks, or even as a teeth whitener. Don't hesitate to create small batches of this versatile substance at home with the help of calcium chloride or alternative solutions, and enjoy its numerous benefits.
