Question: James's favorite basketball player got paid based on how many points he averaged each week. He gets $10,000 if he averages 30 or more points a game and $8,000 if he averages under 30 points a game. For his last week, in the first game he scored 30 points and in the second game he scored 28 points. In the third game he scored 32 points. In the fourth game he scored 34 points and in the fifth game he scored 26 points. How much does he get paid for the week?
Answer: His favorite player scored 150 total points that week because 30 plus 28 plus 32 plus 34 plus 26 equals 150. He averaged 30 points a game because 150 divided by 5 equals 30. He gets paid $10,000 because that's how much he gets if he averages 30 or more points that week. The answer is 10000.
[Question]John sublets his apartment to 3 people who each pay $400 per month. He rents the apartment for $900 a month. How much profit does he make in a year?

Q: A fruit and vegetable merchant installed 15 kg of carrots, 13 kg of zucchini and 8 kg of broccoli. He sold only half of them. What mass of vegetables did he sell?

[Question]John is holding a poker night with his friends and is getting the decks of cards ready before his friends show up. After losing so many cards from various decks, John thinks he needs to count exactly how many cards he has to make sure he has enough full decks for the night. Each deck of cards should hold 52 cards. He finds 3 half-full decks of cards and 3 full decks of cards. As he is arranging them, he realizes that the quality of a lot of the cards is quite poor and decides to throw 34 of the cards in the trash. How many cards does John now have?
[Answer]In the full decks, John has a total of 52 cards in a full deck of cards * 3 full decks of cards = 156 cards. A half - full deck of cards contains 52 cards in a full deck of cards / 2 = 26 cards. So from the half - full decks, John has a total of 26 cards * 3 half - full decks = 78 cards. This is a total of 156 cards from full decks + 78 cards from half - full decks = 234 cards. After throwing some in the trash, he now holds a total of 234 cards - 34 trashed cards = 200 cards. The answer is 200.
