[Question]Camila has only gone hiking 7 times in her life. Amanda has gone on 8 times as many hikes as Camila, and Steven has gone on 15 more hikes than Amanda. If Camila wants to say that she has hiked as many times as Steven and plans to go on 4 hikes a week, how many weeks would it take Camila to achieve her goal?
[Answer]Amanda has gone on 7 hikes x 8 = 56 hikes. Steven has gone on 56 hikes + 15 hikes = 71 hikes. Camila needs to go on another 71 hikes - 7 hikes = 64 hikes. Camila will achieve her goal in 64 hikes / 4 hikes / week = 16 weeks. The answer is 16.
Q: Thomas owns 200 books. He decides to sell them and use the money to buy records. Each book sells for $1.5. A record costs $3. If he buys 75 records, how much money does he have left over?
A: He makes $300 selling the books because 200 x 1.5 = 300. He spends $225 on records because 75 x 3 = 225. He has $75 left because 300 - 225 = 75. The answer is 75.

[Question]Casey is trying to decide which employee she wants to hire. One employee works for $20 an hour. The other employee works for $22 an hour, but Casey would also get a $6/hour subsidy from the government for hiring a disabled worker. How much money per week would Casey save by hiring the cheaper employee, if they both work 40 hours per week?
[Answer]First find the weekly cost of the first employee: $20 / hour * 40 hours / week = $800 / week. Then find the hourly cost of the second employee after the government subsidy: $22 / hour - $6 / hour = $16 / hour. Then find the weekly cost of the second employee: $16 / hour * 40 hours / week = $640 / week. Then subtract the smaller weekly cost from the bigger weekly cost to find the difference: $800 / week - $640 / week = $160 / week. The answer is 160.
Q: One of the clubs at Georgia's school was selling carnations for a fundraising event. A carnation costs $0.50. They also had a special where you could buy one dozen carnations for $4.00. If Georgia sent a dozen carnations to each of her 5 teachers and bought one carnation for each of her 14 friends, how much money would she spend?
A: She wants to send a dozen carnations that cost $4 / dz to each of her 5 teachers, so 4 * 5 = $20. She has 14 friends and she knows a dozen carnations is cheaper than buying 12 single carnations. So 14 - 12 = 2 single carnations are needed. A single carnation cost $0.50 so 2 * .50 = $1.00. All total she will spend 20 + 4 + 1 = $25.00 on carnations. The answer is 25.
