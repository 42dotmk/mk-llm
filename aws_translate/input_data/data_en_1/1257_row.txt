Question: In a school with 800 students, 5/8 of the students are girls. Seven-tenths of the girls and two-fifths of the boys are in the primary grades, while the rest are middle schoolers. How many middle schoolers are there?
Answer: There are 800 x 5 / 8 = 500 girls. So, there are 800 - 500 = 300 boys. There are 500 x 7 / 10 = 350 girls that are in the primary grades. Hence, 500 - 350 = 150 girls are middle schoolers. There are 300 x 2 / 5 = 120 boys that are in the primary grades. Hence, 300 - 120 = 180 boy students are middle schoolers. Therefore, a total of 150 girls + 180 boys = 330 middle schoolers. The answer is 330.
[Question]Brinley's teacher took the grade six students to the San Diego Zoo to watch and learn about animals. While at the zoo, Brinley counted 100 snakes, 80 arctic foxes, and 20 leopards. She also saw ten times more bee-eaters than leopards, half as many cheetahs as snakes, and twice as many alligators as the total number of Arctic foxes and leopards. What's the total number of animals Brinley counted at the zoo?
[Answer]There were 10 * 20 = 200 more bee - eaters at the zoo. There were 1 / 2 * 100 = 50 cheetahs. The total number of foxes and leopards is 80 + 20 = 100. There were 2 * 100 = 200 alligators. The total number of animals is 200 alligators + 220 bee - eaters + 100 snakes + 80 tactic foxes + 20 leopards + 50 cheetahs = 670 animals. The answer is 670.
Q: A pen and pencil have a total cost of $6. If the pen costs twice as much as the pencil, what is the cost of the pen?
A: Let x be the cost of the pencil. If the pen costs 2 times the cost of the pencil, then it costs 2x. Adding the cost of the pen and pencil we get 2x + x = 3x. Since the total cost is $6 then 3x = $6 therefore x = $6 / 3 = $2. One pen is equal to 2 * x which is 2 * $2 = $4. The answer is 4.
Question: Mrs. Lopez and her family are going to the movie theatre. Adult tickets are $11. Children’s tickets (ages 3-12) are $8. Senior citizen’s tickets (ages 60+) are $9. Mrs. Lopez needs to buy movie tickets for her husband, herself, her parents (ages 72 and 75), and her three children (ages 7, 10, 14). How much money does she need to buy everyone’s tickets?
Answer: Mrs. Lopez needs to buy two adult tickets for $11 x 2 = $22. She needs to buy two senior citizen tickets for $9 x 2 = $18. She needs to buy three children’s tickets for $8 x 3 = $24. For everyone’s tickets, Mrs. Lopez needs to spend $22 + $18 + $24 = $64 for seven tickets. The answer is 64.
