No, the genuses Anthemis and Veronica do not belong to the same family. They belong to two different families within the plant kingdom. 

Anthemis, commonly known as chamomile, is a genus that belongs to the family Asteraceae, also known as the sunflower family or the daisy family. The Asteraceae is one of the largest and most diverse families of flowering plants, with over 23,000 species distributed across about 1,620 genera. This family is characterized by its unique inflorescence, called a capitulum, which gives the appearance of a single flower but is actually composed of numerous smaller flowers called florets. Family members often have alternate, simple, and arranged leaves, and they can be found in a variety of habitats worldwide, including grasslands, forests, and wetlands.

Anthemis itself comprises around 200 species of herbaceous perennials and annuals, mainly distributed in the Mediterranean region and Southwest Asia. These plants have finely divided leaves and capitulum inflorescence with white or yellow ray florets surrounding disk florets. Some species within this genus are used for their medicinal properties, such as Anthemis nobilis (Roman chamomile) and Anthemis tinctoria (golden marguerite). These species are known for their calming effects and are used to treat minor ailments like stomachaches, skin irritations, and insomnia.

Veronica, on the other hand, is a genus that belongs to the family Plantaginaceae, which is commonly known as the plantain family. This family includes around 1,900 species of flowering plants spread across about 90 genera. The Plantaginaceae family is characterized by its bilaterally symmetrical flowers with usually five petals that are fused at the base, opposite leaves, and capsules or utricles as fruit types. The family members are distributed worldwide in a variety of habitats, from mountains to coastal regions and from wetlands to arid deserts.

The genus Veronica itself consists of approximately 500 species of annuals, perennials, and subshrubs, widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, Australia, and New Zealand. These plants are known for their brightly colored, usually blue, flowers and their various medicinal uses. Some commonly known species within the Veronica genus are Veronica officinalis (heath speedwell), Veronica chamaedrys (germander speedwell), and Veronica beccabunga (brooklime). These plants have been used for their astringent, diuretic, and expectorant properties, and in the treatment of coughs, respiratory infections, and skin conditions, among other ailments.

In conclusion, while both Anthemis and Veronica are genera of flowering plants, they differ significantly in their taxonomy, morphological characteristics, and distribution. Anthemis belongs to the Asteraceae family and is primarily associated with the Mediterranean region and Southwest Asia, whereas Veronica is a part of the Plantaginaceae family and has a more widespread distribution across the Northern Hemisphere, Australia, and New Zealand. Their flowers, leaves, and fruit structures are different, and they are adapted to distinct habitats and environmental conditions.
