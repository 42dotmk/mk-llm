To make peanut butter and jelly cookies, follow these step-by-step instructions to ensure you get the best possible results. 

1. Gather the ingredients: 
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 cups rolled oats
- 1/2 cup of your favorite jelly or jam

2. Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). This will ensure that the cookies bake evenly and are ready when you're done preparing the dough.

3. Prepare baking sheets: Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. This will prevent the cookies from sticking to the sheets and make it easy to remove them once they're baked.

4. Combine dry ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. This will ensure that the baking soda is evenly distributed in the cookie dough and help the cookies rise properly.

5. Cream butter and sugars: In a large bowl, using a hand mixer or stand mixer, cream together the softened unsalted butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Creaming the butter and sugars ensures that air is incorporated into the mixture, giving the cookies a lighter, more delicate texture.

6. Add peanut butter, egg, and vanilla: Add the creamy peanut butter, large egg, and vanilla extract to the creamed butter mixture. Mix until fully combined, ensuring all ingredients are evenly distributed in the dough.

7. Gradually add dry ingredients: Slowly add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to tough cookies.

8. Stir in rolled oats: Using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, gently stir in the rolled oats, once again being careful not to overmix.

9. Create cookie mounds: Scoop out a heaping tablespoon of cookie dough and, using your hands roll it into a ball. Then, flatten the ball slightly into a thick disc shape. Repeat for the remaining cookie dough, spacing the cookies about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.

10. Create indentations for jelly: Using your thumb or the back of a spoon, gently press down in the center of each cookie to create a small indentation. This is where you'll add the jelly later.

11. Fill indentations with jelly: Using a teaspoon, fill each cookie indentation with your favorite jelly or jam, being careful not to overfill.

12. Bake: Place the baking sheets in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies are lightly golden. Rotate the baking sheets halfway through to ensure even baking.

13. Cool: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for about 5 minutes before transferring them to wire cooling racks to cool completely. Cooling the cookies on the baking sheets helps them to set and maintain their shape.

14. Serve and enjoy: Once completely cooled, enjoy your homemade peanut butter and jelly cookies! Store any leftovers in an airtight container to maintain freshness.
