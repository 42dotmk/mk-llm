Q: When Betty makes cheesecake, she sweetens it with a ratio of one part sugar to four parts cream cheese, and she flavors it with one teaspoon of vanilla for every two cups of cream cheese. For every one teaspoon of vanilla, she uses two eggs. She used two cups of sugar in her latest cheesecake. How many eggs did she use?
A: Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = 2 times her ratio. Thus, she used 2 * 4 = 8 cups of cream cheese. She uses 1 teaspoon of vanilla for 2 cups of cream cheese, so she used 8 / 2 = 4 teaspoons of vanilla. For each teaspoon of vanilla, she uses 2 eggs, so she used 2 * 4 = 8 eggs. The answer is 8.
Question: Every Monday to Friday morning, Alice walks 10 miles through a large grass field to get to school. To avoid the hot afternoon sun on her way home, she walks 12 miles through a forest. When she gets home on Friday, how many miles will she have walked that week?
Answer: On Monday the total number of miles Alice walks to and from school is 10 + 12 = 22 miles. For the other 4 days, from Tuesday to Friday, she walks an additional 4 * 22 = 88 miles. The total number of miles she will have walked by Friday 22 + 88 = 110 miles. The answer is 110.

Question: Mr. McNeely takes a register of the total number of students present in class every day. On a particular week, the number of students in the class on the second day was 40 more than the first day. The number of students who didn't turn up for the class on the second day was twice the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day. On the third day, 1/7 of the total number of students of the class called in sick. If the total number of students in the class is 280, calculate the number of absent students in the three days.
Answer: On the third day, 1 / 7 * 280 = 40 students called in sick. If the number of students absent on the second day was twice the number on the third day, then 2 * 40 = 80 students didn't show up for the class on the second day. The total number of students present in the class on the second day was 280 - 80 = 200. If 40 fewer students showed up for the class on the first day than on the second day, then 200 - 40 = 160 students showed up for the class on the first day. The number of students absent on the first day is 280 - 160 = 120. In the three days, the total number of absentees is 120 + 80 + 40 = 240. The answer is 240.
