[Question]Bill is a painter who is hired to paint a clientâ€™s house. The house has three bedrooms, and twice as many other rooms as bedrooms. The client wants each bedroom painted a different color, and the other rooms painted white. Each room takes 2 gallons of paint. Color paint comes in 1-gallon paint cans, and white paint comes in 3-gallon cans. How many cans of paint will Bill need for the whole house?
[Answer]Bill needs 2 * 3 = 6 gallons of color paint for the 3 bedrooms. Thus, he needs 6 / 1 = 6 cans of color paint for the bedrooms. There are 2 * 3 = 6 other rooms in the house. He needs 2 * 6 = 12 gallons of white paint for the other rooms. Thus, he needs 12 / 3 = 4 cans of white paint. In all, Bill needs 4 + 6 = 10 cans of paint for the whole house. The answer is 10.
Q: Ishmael, Ponce, and Jalen measured their weight and realized Ishmael was 20 pounds heavier than Ponce and that Ponce was 10 pounds lighter than Jalen. If Jalen weighed 160 pounds, calculate the average weight of the three?
A: Since Ponce weighs 10 pounds lighter than Jalen, he weighs 160 - 10 = 150 pounds. The sum of Jalen and Ponce's weight is 150 + 160 = 310 pounds. Ishmael is 20 pounds heavier than Ponce, meaning he weighs 150 + 20 = 170 pounds. The total weight of the three is 310 + 170 = 480 pounds. The average weight of the three is the total weight divided by their number, which totals 480 / 3 = 160 pounds. The answer is 160.
Question: The region east of plain A is 50 square miles less than the region east of plain B. If plain B has 200 square miles, how many square miles do the plains have in total?
Answer: The region of plain A has a total of 200 - 50 = 150 square miles. The total number of square miles for both plains is 150 square miles for plain A + 200 square miles for plain B = 350 square miles. The answer is 350.
[Question]Lisa is a member of the photography club at school. Every weekend the club will go anywhere to take photos. Leslie took 10 photos of animals to share with the club. She also took 3 times as many photos of flowers as animals and took 10 fewer scenery than the flowers. If Lisa took 15 fewer photos last weekend, How many photos did she take then?
[Answer]Lisa took 10 x 3 = 30 photos of flowers. She took 30 - 10 = 20 photos of the scenery. So, Lisa took 10 + 30 + 20 = 60 photos this week. Therefore, Lisa took 60 - 15 = 45 photos last weekend. The answer is 45.
Q: While chatting in the school cafeteria, Cesar's friend Demi tells him that a new fantasy series was on Netflix and he should watch it. The new series has 12 seasons, and each season has 20 episodes. If Cesar watched 1/3 of the series before the school closed, how many episodes were remaining for him to finish the series?
A: The total number of episodes in the series is 20 episodes per season * 12 seasons = 240 episodes. He watches 1 / 3 of the series, 1 / 3 * 240 = 80 episodes. A total of 240 - 80 = 160 episodes were remaining for Cesar to finish the series. The answer is 160.
