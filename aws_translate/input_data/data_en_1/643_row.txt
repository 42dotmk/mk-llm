Question: A family had 10 eggs, but the mother used 5 of them to make an omelet. Then, 2 chickens laid 3 eggs each. How many eggs does the family have now?
Answer: There were 10 eggs but 5 of them were used so, there are 10 - 5 = 5 eggs. Then the two chickens laid 2 * 3 = 6 eggs in total. Thus, the family has 5 + 6 = 11 eggs now. The answer is 11.
[Question]Jenna runs a wholesale business. She pays $3 for each widget and resells it for $8. Every month she has to pay $10,000 in rent, 20% of her total profit in taxes, and $2,500 each to four workers. If Jenna sells 5000 widgets one month, how much is her total profit or loss?
[Answer]First calculate how much Jenna spends on salaries: $2,500 * 4 = $10,000. Next find Jenna's total fixed costs by adding the cost of salaries and rent: $10,000 + $10,000 = $20,000. Next calculate how much profit Jenna makes on each widget by subtracting the cost from the sale price: $8 - $3 = $5. Now multiply the profit per widget by the number of widgets sold: $5 * 5000 = $25,000. Now subtract Jenna's costs from her sales to find her total profit before taxes: $25,000 - $20,000 = $5,000. Now multiply Jenna's profit by her 20% tax rate to find how much she owe in taxes: $5,000 * .2 = $1,000. Now subtract Jenna's taxes from her profit before taxes to find her total profit: $5,000 - $1,000 = $4,000. The answer is 4000.
Q: Geli is committed to her 3 times a week workout. On her first day, she started doing 10 push-ups. Her fitness trainer encouraged her to add 5 more push-ups each day. How many push-ups will she do in total throughout her first week?
A: On the first day, she will do 10 push - ups. On the second day, she will do 10 + 5 = 15 push - ups. On the third day, she will do 15 + 5 = 20 push - ups. So, Geli will do a total of 10 + 15 + 20 = 45 push - ups in a week. The answer is 45.
Question: An NGO contracted a construction company to build 2000 houses within one year. In the first half of the year, they built the first 3/5 units of the contracted number. Due to unavoidable circumstances, the company could only build an additional 300 units by October. How many units remain from the contracted number that the company is supposed to build?
Answer: In the first half of the year, the company constructed 3 / 5 * 2000 = 1200 units. The number of units remaining to be built after the company built 1200 units in the first half of the year is 2000 - 1200 = 800. By October, the company built an additional 300 units, thus remaining with 800 - 300 = 500 units to be built. The answer is 500.
