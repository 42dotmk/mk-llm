[Question]John adopts a dog from a shelter. The dog ends up having health problems and this requires 3 vet appointments, which cost $400 each. After the first appointment, John paid $100 for pet insurance that covers 80% of the subsequent visits. How much did he pay in total?
[Answer]He got a discount of 400 * .8 = $320. He got that discount for 3 - 1 = 2 visits. So each of those visits cost 400 - 320 = $80. So he paid 2 * 80 = $160 for those visits. That means he paid a total of 400 + 160 + 100 = $660. The answer is 660.

Question: Carol has $60 and saves $9 per week. Mike has $90 and saves $3 per week. How many weeks before Carol and Mike both have the same amount of money?
Answer: Let x = the number of weeks. 60 + 9x = 90 + 3x to set them equal. 9x = 30 + 3x. 6x = 30. x = 5. In 5 weeks they will have equal money. The answer is 5.
[Question]Jonsey is awake for 2/3 of the day and spends 1/2 her time awake playing outside and the rest inside. Her brother, Riley, is awake for 3/4 of the day and spends 1/3 of his day outside and the rest inside. How much time, on average, do they spend inside?
[Answer]Jonsey is awake for 16 hours because 24 x (2 / 3) = 16. Jonsey spends 1 / 2 her day inside because 1 - (1 / 2) = 1 / 2. Jonsey spend 8 hours inside because 16 x (1 / 2) = 8. Riley is awake for 18 hours because 24 x (3 / 4) = 18. Riley spends 2 / 3 of his day inside because 1 - (1 / 3) = 2 / 3. Riley spends 12 hours inside because 18 x (2 / 3) = 12. In total they spend 20 hours inside because 8 + 12 = 20. On average, they spend 10 hours inside because 20 / 2 = 10. The answer is 10.
Q: Joan is answering English and Math exams with 30 and 15 questions, respectively. The English exam is to be completed in 1 hour and the Math exam in 1.5 hours. If Joan wants to spend an equal amount of time on each question, how many more minutes does she have in answering each question on the Math exam than the English exam?
A: Joan is given 1 x 60 = 60 minutes to answer the English exam. So Joan will spend 60 / 30 = 2 minutes for each English question. She is given 1.5 x 60 = 90 minutes to answer the Math exam. So, she will spend 90 / 15 = 6 minutes for each Math question. Hence, Joan has 6 - 2 = 4 minutes more for answering each question in Math than in English. The answer is 4.
