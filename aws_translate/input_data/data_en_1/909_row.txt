Antonio Ramiro Romo (born April 21, 1980) is an American football television analyst and former quarterback who played 14 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Eastern Illinois University, where he won the Walter Payton Award in 2002, and led the Panthers to an Ohio Valley Conference championship in 2001. He signed as an undrafted free agent with the Cowboys in 2003. Beginning his career as a holder, Romo became the Cowboys' starting quarterback during the 2006 season.

Romo began the 2007 season with four touchdown passes and an additional touchdown rush, the first of his career, defeating the New York Giants 45-35 in the Cowboys' first game of the regular season, His 345 passing yards in Week 1 led the NFL. In Week 2, he threw for 186 yards and two touchdowns beating the Miami Dolphins, ranking him seventh in passing yards and tied for second with six touchdown passes. Romo added 329 passing yards and two touchdown passes in the Cowboys' Week 3 34-10 win over the Chicago Bears. The following week, he passed for 339 yards and three touchdowns in a 35-7 win over the St. Louis Rams. He also ran for an additional touchdown. This brought his season totals to 1199 passing yards with 11 passing touchdowns and two rushing touchdowns.  In Week 5, on Monday Night Football against the Buffalo Bills, Romo threw five interceptions (four in the first half, two of which were returned for touchdowns) and lost a fumble. He became the second person in the history of Monday Night Football to throw five interceptions in a winning effort. The first person was his quarterbacks coach Wade Wilson. Nonetheless, he threw for 4,211 yards (third in the NFL) and 36 touchdown passes during the regular season (second only to Tom Brady). His 97.4 passer rating was good enough for fifth in the NFL behind Tom Brady, Ben Roethlisberger, David Garrard, and Peyton Manning.  On October 29, Romo reached an agreement to a six-year, $67.5 million contract extension with the Cowboys.  On November 29 against the Green Bay Packers, in a game between 10-1 teams, Romo threw four touchdown passes (bringing his season total to 33), breaking Danny White's (29) record from 1983. On December 22 against the Carolina Panthers, Romo became the first Cowboys' quarterback to pass for more than 4,000 yards in a season. Finally on December 30 against the Washington Redskins, Romo broke the Cowboys' season completions record with his 335th completion, a short pass to tight end Jason Witten. The Cowboys finished the season with a 13-3 record.  In the Cowboys' January 13, 2008, divisional playoff game against the New York Giants, Romo was unable to lead his team to a come-from-behind victory. On fourth down with less than half a minute and no timeouts left, Romo threw the ball into the end zone, but it was intercepted by Giants cornerback R. W. McQuarters, ensuring that the Cowboys were eliminated from the playoffs with a 21-17 loss to the eventual Super Bowl XLII champions.
