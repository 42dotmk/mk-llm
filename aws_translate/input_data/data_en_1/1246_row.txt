In order to determine which country contributed more to the devaluation of their currency, it is important to consider the different approaches taken by Pakistan and India in managing their foreign exchange markets, as well as the results and consequences of these policies.

Pakistan established the Foreign Exchange Control Department to manage and control their foreign exchange market. This was done with the intention of preventing the devaluation of their currency, by maintaining a fixed exchange rate system. However, this rigid approach to exchange rate management often led to the emergence of black markets, resulting in an unfavorable situation where exchange rates for foreign currencies were much higher than the rates set by the government. This, in turn, promoted speculation and the creation of a shadow currency exchange market, which ultimately contributed to further devaluation.

India, on the other hand, took a more liberal approach by allowing the foreign exchange market to regulate itself, without direct intervention from the government. This market-driven approach allowed exchange rates to be determined by the forces of supply and demand, thereby promoting a more stable and flexible foreign exchange market. Though India's currency has also experienced devaluation, the country's decision to avoid strict foreign exchange controls has arguably contributed less to these fluctuations, as market forces were allowed to self-correct.

In comparing the two countries' strategies, Pakistan's effort to control the foreign exchange market likely contributed more to the devaluation of their currency than India's laissez-faire approach, for several reasons:

1. The creation of black markets and shadow currency exchange markets in Pakistan led to significant exchange rate distortions and the erosion of the currency's value, as arbitrage opportunities between the official and black market rates allowed speculators to profit.

2. The strict foreign exchange controls in Pakistan limited the availability of foreign currency, contributing to higher inflation and further eroding the value of the domestic currency.

3. India's market-driven approach allowed for a more flexible exchange rate system that could better adapt to changing economic conditions, which encouraged greater stability in the long term.

4. India's policy promoted stronger investor confidence, as foreign investors were more likely to invest in a country where the market was allowed to operate freely, rather than under strict government control.

Overall, it is reasonable to conclude that Pakistan's attempt to control their foreign exchange market through the creation of the Foreign Exchange Control Department likely contributed more to the devaluation of their currency, compared to India's more liberal approach of allowing the market to regulate itself. This is due to the unintended consequences of strict foreign exchange controls, such as the emergence of black markets and shadow currency exchange markets, which undermined the stability and value of Pakistan's currency, while India's liberal approach promoted greater market stability and investor confidence.
