Reasoning and answer: On Monday, Mr Castiel ate 2 / 5 * 600 = 240 sausages. The remaining number of sausages after he ate 240 on Monday is 600 - 240 = 360. On Tuesday, he ate half of the remaining sausages, a total of 360 / 2 = 180. The remaining number of sausages that he saved for Friday after eating 180 on Tuesday is 360 - 180 = 180. On Friday, Mr Castiel ate 3 / 4 * 180 = 135 of the sausages he had kept. The remaining number of sausages after he ate 135 on Friday is 180 - 135 = 45.
The answer: 45

Question: Mr Castiel prepared 600 boar sausages on the weekend. He ate 2/5 of them on Monday, half of the remaining on Tuesday and saved the rest for Friday. If he ate 3/4 of the remaining boar sausages on Friday, how many sausages are left?

The Adidas purchase was 1 / 5 that of Skechers, therefore the Skechers cost 5 * 600 = 3000 dollars. Spending three times the cost of Adidas on Nike sneakers translates to 3 * 600 = 1800 dollars. All together, the three athletic - sneaker purchases cost Mimi 600 + 1800 + 3000 = 5400 dollars. Subtracting the amount spent on athletic sneakers from the total spent gives 8000 - 5400 = 2600 dollars. Mimi therefore spent 2600 dollars on clothes.
The answer: 2600
Reverse engineering the question: Mimi has decided to start going to the gym again. Over the weekend, she spent $8,000 on athletic sneakers and clothes. She spent thrice as much on Nike sneakers as she did on Adidas. What she spent on Adidas was 1/5 the cost of Skechers. If Mimi's Adidas sneakers purchase was $600, what amount did she spend on clothes?

The answer: 900

Reasoning and answer: Amelia picks 45 - 18 = 27 oranges. The total number of oranges that they pick is 45 + 27 = 72. George picks 15 + 5 = 20 apples. The total number of apples that they pick is 20 + 15 = 35. So, they pick 72 + 35 = 107 fruits altogether.
The answer: 107
