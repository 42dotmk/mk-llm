[Question]Jeff was driving to the capital city to attend a conference. At first, he was driving at 80 miles/hour for about 6 hours, then the speed limit changed and he had to slow down to 60 miles/hour, and so he drove at this speed for 4 hours. Then he made a stop at a gas station. Once the car was full of gas, he drove at 40 miles/hour the rest of the trip for 2 hours. How many miles did he travel?
[Answer]In the first stretch he drove 80 miles / hour x 6 hours = 480 miles. In the second stretch he drove 60 miles / hour x 4 hours = 240 miles. After the gas station he drove 40 miles / hour x 2 hours = 80 miles. In total he drove 480 miles + 240 miles + 80 miles = 800 miles. The answer is 800.
Q: Kris is blowing u balloons for her sister’s party. She has 30 minutes to blow up as many balloons as possible and decides to enlist her brother’s help to increase the number of balloons. Kris can blow up a total of 2 balloon per minute, and her brother works twice as fast. After 15 minutes, her brother doubles his speed and works at this new speed for the remaining 15 minutes. After the 30 minutes, how many balloons, in total, did Kris and her brother blow up?
A: Throughout the 30 minutes, Kris blows up 2 balloons per minute * 30 minutes = 60 balloons. Her brother works at double Kris' speed in the first 15 minutes so he works at 2 balloons per minute * 2 = 4 balloons per minute. So in the first 15 minutes, he blows up 4 balloons per minute * 15 minutes = 60 balloons. In the second 15 minutes, he is working at double the rate he did previously, so he blows up 4 balloons per minute * 2 = 8 balloons per minute. In the second 15 minutes, Kris’ brother therefore blows up 8 balloons per minute * 15 minutes = 120 balloons. Throughout the 30 minutes, he has blown up a total of 60 + 120 = 180 balloons. Kris and her brother therefore blew up a total of 60 balloons from Kris + 180 balloons from Kris’ brother = 240 balloons. The answer is 240.
Question: The sum of Mario and Maria's ages now is 7. Mario is 1 year older than Maria. How old is Mario?
Answer: If x is Maria's age, then Mario's age is x + 1. The equation that represents the sum of their ages is x + x + 1 = 7. By combining like terms, the equation becomes 2x = 6. Hence, the value of x which represents the age of Maria is 6 / 2 = 3. So Mariu is 3 + 1 = 4 years old. The answer is 4.
