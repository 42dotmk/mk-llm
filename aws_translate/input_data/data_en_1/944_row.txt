Long-serving West Brom midfielder James Morrison has put pen to paper on a new contract, extending his stay at The Hawthorns. Morrison, who has made over 300 appearances for the Baggies since joining in 2007 from Middlesbrough, has revealed that chairman Jeremy Peace's "vision" for the club's future played a pivotal role in convincing him to sign the new deal.

James Morrison, a consistent and influential figure in the West Brom team over the past 14 years, could have easily explored other options as his contract expiration drew near. However, the Scottish international highlighted the impressive project set out by Peace as the major incentive for him to extend his tenure at the club.

With a mix of experienced professionals and promising youngsters, the squad assembled by Peace has demonstrated the potential to achieve even greater success in the upcoming seasons.

Morrison's decision to remain at West Brom is not only a testament to the club's progress under Jeremy Peace but also a significant boost for the Baggies as they look to build on the foundations laid in recent years. The 35-year-old midfielder has become a fan favorite at The Hawthorns, thanks to his tireless work ethic, impressive technical ability, and vital contributions on the field, especially during some of the club's most memorable victories.

West Brom manager Valerien Ismael echoed the sentiment of his star midfielder, praising Peace's vision and the collective effort that has gone into the ongoing project at the club.

"Jeremy Peace has a clear plan for the future of West Bromwich Albion, and it is an honor to be working alongside him to take this club to new heights," said Ismael. "James Morrison's commitment to the club reaffirms our belief that we are moving in the right direction. His experience and leadership will be invaluable as we continue to grow and achieve our objectives."
