[Question]Enrique earns a 15% commission on every piece of clothing item he sells. In one day he sells 2 $700.00 suits, 6 shirts that cost $50.00 each and 2 pairs of loafers that are $150.00 each. How much commission does Enrique earn?
[Answer]He sells 2 suits that are $700.00 each for a total of 2 * 700 = $1,400.00. He sells 6 shirts that are $50.00 each for a total of 6 * 50 = $300.00. He sells 2 pairs of loafers that are $150.00 each for a total of 2 * 150 = $300.00. All total he sells 1400 + 300 + 300 = $2,000.00 worth of clothing. He gets a 15% commission off of the the $2,000.00 so he earns .15 * 2000 = $300.00. The answer is 300.

Question: Bob enters cycling competitions every single week and hopes to win the 100 dollar grand prize each time. For the first 2 weeks, he managed first place and got 100 dollars each week. He is saving up for a puppy that costs 1000 dollars. What is the minimum number of additional weeks Bob must win first place?
Answer: Two weeks already passed and Bob has 200 dollars. Bob needs 1000 - 200 = 800 more dollars. Bob needs to win the competition for at least 800 / 100 = 8 more weeks. The answer is 8.
[Question]Erin counts six trolls hiding by the path in the forest, 6 less than four times that number of trolls hiding under the bridge, and half as many trolls hiding in the plains as under the bridge. How many trolls did she count in total?
[Answer]First, multiply the number of forest trolls by 4: 6 trolls * 4 = 24 trolls. Then subtract 6 from that number to find the number of bridge trolls: 24 trolls - 6 trolls = 18 trolls. Then divide that number by 2 to find the number of plains trolls: 18 trolls / 2 = 9 trolls. Then add the number of trolls she saw in each location to find the total number: 6 trolls + 18 trolls + 9 trolls = 33 trolls. The answer is 33.
