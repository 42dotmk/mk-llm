In ancient Rome, the title of a magistrate who was next in importance to a consul was a "Praetor." The office of the praetor emerged around 366 BCE to assist consuls with their increasing administrative and judicial responsibilities. At first, there was only one praetor, but as the Roman Republic expanded, the number of praetors grew. Eventually, around the 2nd century BCE, the number of praetors reached eight. Their main responsibilities included presiding over the administration of justice, both civil and criminal, as well as holding imperium, which granted them the authority to command military forces and govern provinces.

Praetors had several key roles to play during their tenure. Firstly, they were responsible for the management of civil law cases in Rome, specifically dealing with disputes between Roman citizens (known as ius civile cases) and disputes between Roman citizens and non-citizens (known as ius gentium cases). The praetors' primary function was to ensure that justice was served and maintain law and order within the Roman state.

One of the ways in which they accomplished this was by issuing edicts or praetorian law (edictum praetoris) at the beginning of their term, which set forth the legal procedures and rules they would follow during their time in office. Praetorian law was an important part of Roman law because it enabled the legal system to adapt to new circumstances and evolve over time. As such, the praetor's position was not only administrative but also held a significant legislative component.

Secondly, praetors were also responsible for presiding over criminal cases. The two primary types of criminal courts at the time were the quaestiones perpetuae, which focused on a specific type of crime (e.g., murder or treason), and the extraordinary criminal courts (quaestiones extraordinariae), created to address urgent matters that did not fall under the purview of the quaestiones perpetuae. The praetor could play a key role in either court type, by either organizing the court, gathering evidence, or officiating over a trial.

Thirdly, since the praetor held imperium, they shared military and political responsibilities with the consuls. This meant that they could be called upon to command armies in times of war or manage provinces in times of peace. While some military campaigns were led by the consuls, others would be delegated to a praetor. In addition, a praetor could also be appointed to govern a province, ensuring Roman laws were enforced, and Rome's interests were maintained in its territories. Such duties included managing taxation and provincial resources and maintaining order in the region.

In summary, the praetor was a crucial figure in the Roman Republic who was second only to the consul in terms of power and importance. They played a significant role in maintaining law and order, overseeing both civil and criminal cases, and administrating justice. Furthermore, their duty to uphold Roman law and represent the interests of Rome in provinces or on the battlefield made the praetorian position integral to the functioning and expansion of the Republic.
