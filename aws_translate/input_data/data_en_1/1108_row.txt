Question: Cynthia wants floor-to-ceiling curtains made with an additional 5" of material so it will pool at the bottom. If her room is 8 feet tall, how long will the curtains need to be?
Answer: There are 12 inches in 1 foot and her room height is 8 feet so that's 12 * 8 = 96 inches tall. She wants an additional 5 inches of material added so the 96 inch long curtains will pool so she needs 5 + 96 = 101 inch long curtains. The answer is 101.
[Question]Ben spends 20% of his after-tax income on his car. If his car payment is $400 and he pays 1/3 of his gross income in taxes, how much does he make per month before taxes?
[Answer]First divide that amount of the car payment by 20% to find Ben's after - tax salary: $400 / .2 = $2000. Then find the proportion of his salary Ben keeps after taxes by subtracting the tax rate from 1: 1 - 1 / 3 = 2 / 3. Then divide Ben's after - tax salary by the proportion of his salary he keeps to find his before - tax salary: $2000 / 2 / 3 = $3000. The answer is 3000.
Q: A woman needs to buy 16 oz of butter for a dessert recipe. She can either buy a single 16 oz package of the store-brand butter for $7, or she can buy an 8oz package of store butter for $4 and use a coupon to get an additional two 4 oz packages that normally sell for $2.0 each at a 50% discount (which is applied to each 4oz package separately). What is the lowest price she can pay for the 16 oz of butter she needs?
A: If she uses the coupon, she will pay 2 * 0.5 = $1 for each 4oz package. Thus, she will pay 4 + 2 * 1 = $6 in total for the 8oz package and the two 4oz packages she needs to reach 16 oz of butter when using the coupon. Therefore, the lowest amount she can pay is $6, as this is cheaper than the $7 price for a 16 oz package. The answer is 6.
Question: In a factory, there are 3 machines working 23 hours a day. The owner decided to buy a fourth machine, which works only 12 hours a day. One machine can produce 2 kg of material every hour. The factory sells the produced material for $50 per 1 kg. How much can this factory earn in one day?
Answer: The total runtime for the first three machines is 3 machines * 23 hours / day / machine = 69 hours / day. So these machines could produce 69 hours / day * 2 kg / hour = 138 kg / day. The fourth machine could produce 12 hours / day * 2 kg / hour = 24 kg / day of material. In total all the machines would produce 138 kg / day + 24 kg / day = 162 kg / day of material. The factory would therefore earn 162 kg / day * $50 / kg = $8100 / day. The answer is 8100.
[Question]The average GPA for 6th graders is 93, the 7th graders is 2 more than the 6th graders and the 8th graders average GPA is 91. What is the average GPA for the school?
[Answer]The 7th graders average GPA is 2 more than the 6th graders GPA of 93 so 93 + 2 = 95. If you combine the GPA for all three grades then they have 93 + 95 + 91 = 279. The average GPA for the school is 279 / 3 = 93. The answer is 93.
