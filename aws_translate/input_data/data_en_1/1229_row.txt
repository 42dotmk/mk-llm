Q: A couple with two children, ages 6 and 10 years old, decided to go to an amusement park. The regular ticket costs $109, but children below 12 years old have a $5 discount. If they gave the cashier $500, how much change will they receive?
A: The ticket costs 109 - 5 = $104 for each child. So the ticket cost of the two children is 104 x 2 = $208. The couple needs to pay the regular price, so it's 109 x 2 = $218. Thus, the family needs to pay a total of 208 + 218 = $426. Therefore, their change is 500 - 426 = $74. The answer is 74.
Question: James decides to replace his car. He sold his $20,000 car for 80% of its value and then was able to haggle to buy a $30,000 sticker price car for 90% of its value. How much was he out of pocket?
Answer: He sold his car for 20000 * .8 = $16,000. He bought the new car for 30,000 * .9 = $27,000. That means he was out of pocket 27,000 - 16,000 = $11,000. The answer is 11000.
[Question]A chair costs 1/7 of the cost of a table. If a table costs $140, how much will it cost to buy a table and 4 chairs?
[Answer]One chair costs $140 x 1 / 7 = $20. Four chairs cost $20 x 4 = $80. So a table and 4 chairs cost $140 + $80 = $220. The answer is 220.
Q: Carol is an aviation engineer deciding how much fuel to put in a jet. The empty plane needs 20 gallons of fuel per mile. Each person on the plane increases this amount by 3 gallons per mile, and each bag increases it by 2 gallons per mile. If there are 30 passengers and 5 flight crew, and each person brought two bags, how many gallons of fuel does the plane need for a 400-mile trip?
A: First find the total number of people by adding the number of passengers and flight crew: 30 people + 5 people = 35 people. Then find the total number of bags by doubling the total number of people: 35 people * 2 bags / person = 70 bags. Then find the fuel increase caused by the people by multiplying their number by the fuel increase per person: 35 people * 3 gallons / mile / person = 105 gallons / mile. Then multiply the number of bags by the fuel increase per bag to find the total fuel increase they cause: 70 bags * 2 gallons / mile / bag = 140 gallons / mile. Now add the fuel increases to the base fuel consumption to find the total fuel needed per mile: 140 gallons / mile + 105 gallons / mile + 20 gallons / mile = 265 gallons / mile. Now multiply the fuel consumption per mile by the number of miles flown to find the total amount of fuel needed: 265 gallons / mile * 400 miles = 106,000 gallons of fuel. The answer is 106000.
Question: Henry took 9 pills a day for 14 days. Of these 9 pills, 4 pills cost $1.50 each, and the other pills each cost $5.50 more. How much did he spend in total on the pills?
Answer: There were 9 - 4 = 5 other pills. Each of the other pills cost 1.50 + 5.50 = 7 dollars each. The 5 pills cost a total of 7 * 5 = 35 dollars. The first 4 pills cost 1.50 * 4 = 6 dollars in total. Henry spent a total of 35 + 6 = 41 dollars. The answer is 41.
