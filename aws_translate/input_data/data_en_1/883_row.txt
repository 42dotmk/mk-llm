Q: When Michelle makes fresh pasta, she first makes the dough, then she rolls it out and cuts it, and then she hangs it on racks to dry for cooking later. She needs a drying rack for each three pounds of pasta she makes, and it takes two cups of flour to make each pound of pasta dough. She owns three racks right now. How many more drying racks will Michelle need if she makes pasta using three 8-cup bags of flour?
A: Michelle used 3 * 8 = 24 cups of flour in the pasta dough. She made 24 / 2 = 12 pounds of pasta dough. She needs 12 / 3 = 4 drying racks for the pasta. Thus, Michelle needs 4 - 3 = 1 more drying rack. The answer is 1.
Question: Mark was caught speeding and the judge wants to make an example out of him. The base fine for speeding is $50 but additional penalties apply in this case. The fine is increased by $2 for every mile per hour Mark was going over the speed limit. He was going 75 miles per hour in a 30 mile per hour zone. The fine is also doubled because he was in a school zone. Finally, the judge makes Mark pay $300 in court costs and he also has to pay his lawyer $80/hour for three hours of work. How much does Mark owe for this speeding ticket?
Answer: First figure out how many miles over the speed limit Mark was going: 75 mph - 30 mph = 45 mph. Now figure out how much the per - mile fine is: $2 / mph * 45 mph = $90. Now add that amount to the base fine: $90 + $50 = $140. Now double that amount for being in a school zone: $140 * 2 = $280. Now figure out how much Mark owes his lawyer: $80 / hour * 3 hours = $240. Now add the court costs, lawyer fees and fine: $240 + $300 + $280 = $820. The answer is 820.
