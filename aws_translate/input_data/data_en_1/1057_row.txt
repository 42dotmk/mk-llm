The first Soviet Union republic to establish its independence when the Soviet Union was dissolving was Lithuania. This historic event was a result of a long struggle for freedom and growing nationalistic sentiments within the Lithuanian population during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Lithuania's journey towards independence started with the inception of the reform movement called "Sąjūdis" (Lithuanian Reform Movement) in June 1988. This movement was initiated by a group of intellectuals, artists, and politicians who aimed to bring democratic reforms and autonomy to Lithuania. Sąjūdis gained significant support from the Lithuanian population and managed to elect many of its sympathetic representatives to the Congress of People's Deputies in the Soviet Union, which was a result of several popular demonstrations and actions in support of their cause.

During the Soviet Union's weakening economic and political situation in the late 1980s, the Lithuanian independence movement gained momentum. Under the pressure of various regional movements and widespread protests, the Soviet Union adopted a policy of decentralization and allowed more autonomy for its republics.

On March 11, 1990, Lithuania's Supreme Soviet, which was the highest state organ in the Lithuanian SSR, adopted the "Act of the Re-establishment of the State of Lithuania." In this declaration, Lithuania claimed its independence from the Soviet Union and decided to restore the independent Lithuanian state that had existed between the First and Second World War, before being occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940.

The immediate international reaction was cautious, and it took some time for other countries to recognize Lithuania's independence. The Soviet Union, led by President Mikhail Gorbachev, opposed the declaration and tried to prevent Lithuania's independence by applying political pressure and economic sanctions. This Soviet response resulted in several confrontations between Soviet military forces and the Lithuanian independence movement.

The critical event that furthered Lithuania's recognition as an independent state occurred in January 1991. Soviet authorities ordered a military intervention in Lithuania to suppress the growing independence movement. However, this action generated strong resistance from the Lithuanian population and prompted widespread international condemnation. As a result, the Soviet Union's authority and reputation were further undermined.

By the summer of 1991, the situation in the Soviet Union had significantly deteriorated. In August, an unsuccessful coup attempt in Moscow marked the beginning of the end for the Soviet Union. Following this event, the Soviet Union started recognizing the independence of its former republics.

Lithuania's steadfastness paved the way for other Soviet republics to demand independence, and soon, many of them declared their sovereignty. Eventually, on December 26, 1991, the Soviet Union was officially dissolved, marking the end of an era and giving birth to several new independent states, including Lithuania, which had bravely led the way in the quest for freedom and self-determination.
