a). Sarah ended up putting all the effort into it.

It was the day of the big fundraiser that Sarah and Megan had planned for the local animal shelter. Sarah was a devout animal lover, dedicating her life to rescuing and rehabilitating homeless and injured animals. Megan, on the other hand, wasn't as invested in the cause — she agreed to help out with the planning and execution as a favor to her lifelong friend. 

Sarah knew that this fundraiser could make or break the future of the shelter. They needed to raise enough money to keep the facility running and expand their operations, giving homes to even more animals in need. If they didn't, the shelter would be forced to close its doors, leaving countless animals without a safe place. This was an outcome Sarah simply couldn't bear to imagine.

Despite knowing how important this event was to Sarah, Megan's actions showed little care or dedication. While Sarah dedicated every spare moment to organizing the event — from reaching out to local businesses for donations to designing flyers — Megan consistently dragged her feet. She seemed uninterested in the planning process, putting off tasks and offering little assistance or constructive input. 

As the fundraiser day approached, the divide between their efforts became even more apparent. With Megan shirking her responsibilities, Sarah was forced to put in late nights and skip outings with friends to ensure that everything was in order. Her time was consumed by tasks like preparing the venue, creating decorations, and coordinating volunteers and staff. Despite the exhaustion and frustration, Sarah refused to let anything stand in her way; she saw the faces of the animals that she was fighting for, and that drove her on.

On the day of the fundraiser, Sarah was delighted to see that her hard work had paid off. Local businesses had generously donated a wide array of items for the silent auction, and the community arrived in droves to show their support. There was live music, delicious food, and heartfelt speeches that touched on the incredible work done by the shelter.

It was during Sarah's impassioned speech about the importance of preserving the shelter that Megan finally understood the gravity of the situation. Perhaps it was the tears in Sarah's eyes or the way the crowd hung onto every word she said; something finally clicked for Megan. In that moment, she regretted not putting in the effort that her friend so desperately needed from her.

As the fundraiser came to an end, the two friends stood together, exhausted but happy. They had raised a significant amount of funds required to not only keep the doors open but also to expand. At that moment, Megan pulled Sarah aside and apologized sincerely for her previous lack of support. She promised to do better and be there for her friend in the future, understanding how much the shelter meant to Sarah and the countless animals it saved. 

In the end, the story of Sarah and Megan's efforts serves as a lesson about the importance of dedication and empathy, along with the power of friendship. With perseverance and support, even the most daunting challenges can be overcome.
