Question: Jackson wants to go on a shopping spree, so his mom says she will give him some spending money if he does extra chores. She promises $5 per hour spent on chores. Jackson spends 2 hours vacuuming, and decides to do this twice. He also spends 0.5 hours washing dishes, and three times as long cleaning the bathroom. How much spending money has Jackson earned?
Answer: Jackson spent a total of 2 * 2 = 4 hours vacuuming. This means he earned 4 * $5 = 20 dollars from vacuuming. He earned 0.5 * $5 = 2.5 dollars from washing dishes. Cleaning the bathroom took three times as long as the dishes, so he spent 0.5 * 3 = 1.5 hours in the bathroom. This means he earned 1.5 * $5 = $7.5 from cleaning the bathroom. In total, he has earned $20 + $2.5 + $7.5 = $30. The answer is 30.

Question: While at the lake, Cohen saw 300 fish-eater birds that had migrated into the area recently walking by the lake, eating the fish they had caught. The number of birds at the lake doubled on the second day and reduced by 200 on the third day. How many fish-eater birds did Cohen see in the three days?
Answer: Since there were 300 fish - eater birds in the lake on the first day, the number doubled to 2 * 300 = 600 birds on the second day. The total number of fish that Cohen saw in the lake in the two days is 600 + 300 = 900. On the third day, the number of fish in the lake reduced to 600 - 200 = 400 birds. In the three days, Cohen saw 400 + 900 = 1300 fish - eater birds at the lake. The answer is 1300.
