World War 2 is commonly considered to have started in Europe with the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939; however, the conflict between China and Japan that eventually consolidated into the broader war began earlier. This Sino-Japanese conflict, which was later assimilated into World War 2, began on July 7, 1937.

To understand the origins of this conflict, it is helpful to delve into the historical background of the events leading up to it. In September 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria, a region in northeastern China, following the Mukden Incident. The invasion led to the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo, controlled by Japan the following year. The League of Nations condemned this aggressive move, prompting Japan to withdraw from the international organization in 1933.

Meanwhile, the tensions between Japan and China continued to escalate, with incidents of armed skirmishes occurring frequently along their borders. On July 7, 1937, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident took place near Beijing when a minor clash between Chinese and Japanese troops quickly spiraled out of control. This event marked the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War.

As the conflict escalated, the Japanese forces launched a full-scale invasion of China, rapidly occupying key cities, including Shanghai and the capital, Nanjing (then spelled Nanking). The Nanjing Massacre, also known as the Rape of Nanking, occurred in December 1937, when the invading Japanese army murdered, raped, and brutalized tens of thousands of Chinese civilians.

During the course of the war, both sides experienced significant casualties. The Chinese endured prolonged Japanese aggression as well as internal strife, as the Communist and Nationalist factions within the country temporarily joined forces to resist the invasion. The war in China was not limited to conventional military confrontations; guerilla warfare, terrorism, and acts of sabotage were commonplace throughout the conflict.

The Second Sino-Japanese War merged with World War 2 as Japan increased its level of aggression in the region. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 forced the United States to enter the war, marking the beginning of the Pacific War that eventually led to the downfall of the Japanese Empire.

The conflict in China continued until the end of World War 2. The official defeat of Japan came on September 2, 1945, with their formal surrender. The Chinese Civil War between the Communist and Nationalist factions resumed shortly thereafter, ultimately leading to the establishment of the People's Republic of China by the Communist Party in 1949, and the retreat of the Nationalist government to Taiwan.

In conclusion, the start of World War 2 in China can be traced back to the Marco Polo Bridge Incident on July 7, 1937, which marked the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War. This conflict eventually merged with the broader global war, becoming an integral part of the fight against Axis powers. The war in China had immense implications for the country's political and social landscape, setting the stage for its contemporary historical trajectory.
