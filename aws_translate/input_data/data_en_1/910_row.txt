Q: Julia just adopted a puppy for $20.00 from the local pet shelter. Before she brings the puppy home, she needs to buy a bag of dog food for $20.00, 2 bags of treats for $2.50 a bag, an assortment box of toys for $15.00, a crate and a bed for $20.00 each, and the collar/leash combo for $15.00. The store offered Julia a 20% new-customer discount. How much will Julia spend on the new puppy?
A: The treats are $2.50 a bag and she buys 2 bags for a total of 2.50 * 2 = $5.00. The crate and bed are $20.00 each so they will cost 2 * 20 = $40.00. She spends $20.00 on dog food, $5.00 on treats, $15.00 on toys $40.00 for a crate and bed and $15.00 for a leash for a total of 20 + 5 + 15 + 40 + 15 = $95.00. With the 20% off, she can expect a .20 * 95 = $19 discount on her order. Her supplies were $95.00 and she has a $19.00 discount for a total of 95 - 19 = $76.00. Her supplies cost $76.00 and the puppy adoption was $20.00 for a grand total of 76 + 20 = $96.00. The answer is 96.

[Question]A seminar is offered to a school for their teachers. The regular seminar fee is $150 but they offer a 5% discount if they register 2 days before the scheduled seminar. The school registered 10 teachers for the seminar a week before the schedule and it also released a $10 food allowance for each of the teachers. How much did the school spend in all?
[Answer]The school got a $150 x 5 / 100 = $7.50 seminar fee discount for each teacher. Each teacher's seminar fee costs $150 - $7.50 = $142.50. So, ten teachers' seminar fees cost $142.50 x 10 = $1425. The food allowance for 10 teachers amounts to $10 x 10 = $100. Therefore, the school spent a total of $1425 + $100 = $1525. The answer is 1525.
Q: In his phone gallery, Malachi has the number of selfies he took last year and this year in the ratio of 10:17. If he has 2430 photos in his gallery, how many more photos did he take this year than last year?
A: The total ratio representing the number of photos in the Malachi gallery is 10 + 17 = 27. The difference in the ratios representing the number of photos Malachi took this year and last year is 17 - 10 = 7. This year, Malachi took 7 / 27 * 2430 = 630 more photos than he took last year. The answer is 630.
Question: Miss Aisha's legs are 1/3 of her total height. If her head is also 1/4 of her total height, and she is 60 inches tall, calculate the length of the rest of her body.
Answer: Miss Aisha's legs are 1 / 3 * 60 = 20 inches. The length of her head is 1 / 4 * 60 = 15 inches. Together, her head and legs are 15 + 20 = 35 inches. If her total height is 60, the rest of her body has a length of 60 - 35 = 25 inches. The answer is 25.
