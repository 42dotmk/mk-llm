Title: Manchester United Secures Strong Lead in English Premier League Heading into 2013

As we approach the turn of the year, Manchester United stands solidly ahead with a seven-point lead in the English Premier League (EPL) and it seems as though the prestigious football club is set on its path to claim its rightful place. With only a few games left to play, the world-famous football club edges closer to securing an impressive victory for their 2013 season.

Under the expert tutelage of Sir Alex Ferguson, Manchester United has consistently displayed its characteristic dominance, culminating in a tactful 2-0 win against West Bromwich Albion this past Saturday. The victory not only highlighted the team's on-field prowess but also marked a rare clean sheet for them during the season. This perfect combination of offensive and defensive play aided their climb in the rankings and the widening of the gap between them and the second spot.

Speaking of the second spot, Manchester City has had quite the season itself. Despite being in the shadow of their 2011-2012 EPL title, the team struggled to maintain a consistent winning streak. However, in a thrilling display of determination, Manchester City emerged as victors in a 4-3 showdown against Norwich City. This outcome came as a surprise considering the dismissal of Samir Nasri due to a controversial red card in the first half, forcing the team to play a man down. It is commendable that the team managed to overcome this obstacle and secure a victory that put them directly behind Manchester United in the ranking.

Additionally, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal have managed to make quite a mark this season. Spurs persevered to secure their hold on the third spot with an impressive 2-1 win against Sunderland. The outcome of this match showed the team's undeniable skill and their resilience in the face of challenges. While Spurs may not be in direct contention for first place, their performance this season has garnered the attention and admiration of fans globally.

Arsenal, holding the esteemed honor of sitting on the fifth position in EPL, demonstrated their prowess in an epic 7-3 victory over Newcastle United. The team's offensive power cannot be disputed, as they flaunted their abilities and left fans stunned by the sheer number of goals scored in this particular match. Arsenal's impressive performance this season showcases the team's incredible talent and determination as they continue their fight for a higher ranking in the coming months.

In conclusion, Manchester United's seven-point lead in the English Premier League has been a result of hard work, exceptional coaching, and the dedication of the team's players. As 2013 begins, fans can't help but hold their breath in anticipation of what the rest of the season will bring, while rivals scramble to close the gap between them and the indomitable Manchester United. Despite these pursuits and efforts, Manchester United remains on course to potentially claim another title under the legendary reign of Sir Alex Ferguson. As the competition continues to unfold, the world watches as history is made in the world of football.
