A dollar is 100 cents, so standard postage is 108 cents. Deborahâ€™s four letters cost 108 * 4 = 432 cents for standard postage. She paid 460 - 432 = 28 cents for international shipping on two letters. Thus, the additional international shipping charge is 28 / 2 = 14 cents per letter.
The answer: 14
Reverse engineering the question: Deborah has four letters to mail. Standard postage is $1.08 per letter, with an additional charge for international mail. Deborah is mailing two letters internationally, and she is paying $4.60 to mail four letters. How many cents is the additional charge per letter for international shipping?

Reasoning and answer: Lexie's brother is 8 - 6 = 2 years old. Her sister is 8 x 2 = 16 years old. The age difference between her brother and sister is 16 - 2 = 14 years.
The answer: 14

Question: Lexie is 6 years older than her brother and her sister is twice her age. If Lexie is 8, what is the age difference between her brother and her sister?

In each round, the 5 players removed a total of 5 * 1 = 5 blocks. In the 5 rounds played, the players removed a total of 5 * 5 = 25 blocks. Adding the block removed by Jess's father in the sixth round, a total of 25 + 1 = 26 blocks were removed. Before the tower fell, there were 54 - 26 = 28 blocks.
The answer: 28
Reverse engineering the question: Jess and her family play Jenga, a game made up of 54 stacked blocks in which each player removes one block in turns until the stack falls. The 5 players, including Jess, play 5 rounds in which each player removes one block. In the sixth round, Jess's father goes first. He removes a block, causing the tower to almost fall. Next, Jess tries to remove another block knocking down the tower. How many blocks did the tower have before Jess's turn?

Reasoning and answer: An hour has 60 minutes. If each call lasts an hour, the total amount of money charged is 60 * .05 = $3 for 1 customer. When she talks to 50 clients in a week, the total amount of money charged is 50 * 3 = $150. In a month of 4 weeks, the phone bill is 150 * 4 = $600.
The answer: 600

Macey needs to save $3 - $1.50 = $1.50 more for the shirt. So she needs $1.50 / $0.50 = 3 more weeks to save for the remaining amount.
The answer: 3
Reverse engineering the question: Macey saves to buy herself a shirt that costs $3. She was able to save $1.50 already. How many weeks does she need to save for the remaining amount if she saves $0.50 per week?

Per week, one cow produces 108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters / cow. The cows produced 2160 liters of milk over 5 weeks. So we have 2160 liters / 18 liters / cow = 120 cows. Further, we have to divide 120 cows / 5 weeks = 24 cows.
The answer: 24
