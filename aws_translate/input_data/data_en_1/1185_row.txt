Q: Frank is walking through a corn maze. He has already spent 45 minutes inside. He has done 4 other corn mazes and finished those in 50 minutes on average. How much longer can he spend inside if he wants to ensure that his average doesn't go above 60 minutes per maze?
A: He needs to keep his total time at 300 or below because 5 x 60 = 300. His total time spent in the other mazes is 200 because 4 x 50 = 200. His total time spent in the five mazes thus far is 245 because 200 + 45 = 245. He can spend 55 more minutes on this maze before his average go above 60 because 300 - 245 = 55. The answer is 55.
Question: Archie needs to lay sod in his backyard that measures 20 yards by 13 yards. He has a shed on it that measures 3 yards by 5 yards. How many square yards of sod will Archie need for his backyard?
Answer: 20 * 13 = 260 square yards. 3 * 5 = 15 square yards. 260 - 15 = 245 square yards. Archie needs 245 square yards of sod. The answer is 245.
[Question]Frank needs to meet a quota at work for his sales. Itâ€™s the beginning of the month and in 30 days he needs to have 50 cars sold. The first three days he sold 5 cars each day. Then the next 4 days he sold 3 cars each day. If the month is 30 days long how many cars does he need to sell for the remaining days to meet his quota?
[Answer]On days one, two, and three he sold 5 cars each day so, 5 cars + 5 cars + 5 cars = 15 cars that he sold on those days. On days 4,5,6 and 7 he sold 3 cars each day so, 3 cars + 3 cars + 3 cars + 3 cars = 12 cars that he sold on those days. Now we combine the cars he has already sold, which is 15 cars, and 12 cars, so 15 cars + 12 cars = 27 cars are sold in total. If he needs to sell 50 cars and has already sold 27 cars then 50 cars - 27 cars = 23 cars left to sell to meet his quota. The answer is 23.
Q: Leo had 400 marbles in a jar. He packed the marbles with ten marbles in each pack, and he gave some of them to his two friends, Manny and Neil.  He gave Manny 1/4 of the number of packs of marbles, Neil received 1/8 of the number of packs of marbles, and he kept the rest. How many packs of marbles did Leo keep?
A: Leo had 400 / 10 = 40 packs of marbles. He gave Manny 1 / 4 x 40 = 10 packs of marbles. And, Neil received 1 / 8 x 40 = 5 packs of marbles. Thus, Leo. gave a total of 10 + 5 = 15 packs of marbles. Therefore, Leo kept 40 - 15 = 25 packs of marbles. The answer is 25.
