The sentence, "The putrid odor filled the room," suggests several effects that could transpire during this particular situation. In a more detailed and comprehensive manner, the implications of this scenario are as follows:

1. Discomfort and Distress: A putrid odor usually results from decomposition, deterioration, or decay, which often causes uneasiness and distress in individuals who come across it. The strong smell's pervasiveness can lead to discomfort and perhaps even difficulty breathing, depending on the intensity of the odor.

2. Physical Reactions: The strong and repulsive nature of this odor might trigger several physical reactions in individuals who are present in the room. For instance, reflexes like coughing, gagging, or sneezing can be expected as the body attempts to clear the offensive aroma. In more severe cases, people exposed to putrid odors may develop headaches and nausea, leading to vomiting.

3. Evacuation of the Room: When faced with an overpowering putrid smell, the immediate reaction for most people would be to leave the room to escape the unpleasant experience. In this scenario, it's likely that any occupants in the room would promptly vacate the area in search of fresher, more breathable air. 

4. Attempts to Eliminate or Mask the Odor: As the putrid odor can be unbearable, efforts to identify and eliminate the source of the smell may ensue. This could involve disposing of anything that could be contributing to the offensive smell, such as garbage, spoiled food, or even a dead animal. In cases where the smell cannot be removed easily, resorting to methods that mask the odor like air fresheners, candles, or ventilation may be applied.

5. Investigating the Cause: A putrid odor often indicates an underlying problem that requires attention. As such, the presence of this smell in the room could spur the occupants to investigate the potential cause, whether it's plumbing issues, mold growth, or inadequate sanitary conditions. 

6. Emotional Responses: Exposure to the putrid smell can evoke strong emotional reactions like disgust, irritation, or even fear, particularly if the source of the odor is unknown. Such feelings can be intense and could create a lasting memory of the experience for an individual, which could contribute to heightened sensitivity or aversion to similar odors in the future.

7. Effects on Human Activities: In specific settings like homes, offices, or public spaces, the putrid odor can compromise the quality and functioning of the environment. For example, it might be impossible to concentrate on work or leisure activities in a room filled with such a smell. This could necessitate the cancellation or rescheduling of events and engagements, resulting in disruptions of daily routines and plans.

In summary, the putrid odor filling the room generates several effects in terms of physical discomfort, emotional reactions, disruptions in human activities, and a potential investigation into the underlying cause. With these outcomes in mind, individuals exposed to the unpleasant aroma would seek ways to mitigate, eliminate, or, at the very least, escape the pervasive smell.
