When determining the allowances to be made over and above the basic time for operations, it is important to consider various factors that may affect the efficiency and productivity of the work being carried out. These allowances account for the changes or additional requirements that may be necessary to complete the tasks at hand. Here are seven key factors that should be taken into consideration:

1. Personal needs allowance: This allowance is made to account for the time that workers require to tend to their personal needs, such as restroom breaks and drinking water. Generally, a personal needs allowance of approximately 5% of the total working time is considered appropriate.

2. Fatigue allowance: Fatigue allowance accounts for workers' need to rest and recover from physically or mentally demanding tasks. This allowance varies depending on the nature of the work, with tasks that are more physically demanding requiring a higher fatigue allowance. The fatigue allowance can range from 5% to 15% of the worker's total working time.

3. Machine downtime allowance: This allowance is made to account for when the machines or equipment used in the operations may require maintenance, repairs, or adjustments. The downtime allowance will depend on the reliability and maintenance records of the machinery being used.

4. Learning curve allowance: It is important to consider that workers may not be fully proficient in new tasks or operations right away. A learning curve allowance accounts for the additional time that workers may need to familiarize themselves with these tasks and reach optimal productivity levels.

5. Contingency allowance: Unforeseen events and disruptions can occur during any operation or task. A contingency allowance should be made to account for these unpredictable factors, such as emergencies, accidents, or equipment breakdowns. The specific contingency allowance will vary based on the riskiness and complexity of the task.

6. Quality allowance: Ensuring that high-quality work is completed can require an additional investment of time beyond the basic duration of tasks. A quality allowance should be made to accommodate any extra time that may need to be spent on inspections, rework, or adjustments to meet quality standards.

7. Special circumstances allowance: There may be specific situations or challenges that arise throughout the task that require additional time to be allocated. These special circumstances can include working in extreme temperatures, dealing with physical constraints or limitations, or managing particularly complex or valuable materials.

In conclusion, when determining the allowances to be made over and above the basic time for operations, it is crucial to consider factors such as personal needs, fatigue, machine downtime, learning curves, contingency requirements, quality assurance, and any special circumstances that may arise. By accurately accounting for these various allowances, a more realistic and practical assessment of the time required for completing operations can be achieved, ultimately leading to improved productivity and operational efficiency.
