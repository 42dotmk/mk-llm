Q: Elsa's hockey team just made the playoffs along with two other teams. They make the playoffs by having the top three highest points for their records. Teams get 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie, and zero points for a loss. The first-place team has 12 wins and 4 ties. The second-place team has 13 wins and 1 tie. Elsa's team has 8 wins and 10 ties. What is the average number of points for the playoff teams?
A: The teams have 33 total wins because 12 + 13 + 8 = 33. The teams have 66 points from wins because 33 x 2 = 66. The teams have 15 total ties because 4 + 1 + 10 = 15. The teams have 15 points from ties because 15 x 1 = 15. The teams have 81 total points because 66 + 15 = 81. The average number of points per team is 27 because 81 / 3 = 27. The answer is 27.
Question: A banana tree has 100 bananas left after Raj cut some bananas from it. If Raj has eaten 70 bananas and has twice as many remaining in his basket, how many bananas were on the tree initially?
Answer: If Raj has eaten 70 bananas in the basket, he has 2 * 70 = 140 bananas. The total number of bananas that Raj cut from the tree is 140 + 70 = 210. On the tree initially were 100 + 210 = 310 bananas. The answer is 310.
[Question]Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?
[Answer]We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = 200 books. So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 â€“ 200 = 600 books. The answer is 600.
Q: Donna is trying to figure out if her truck is over a particular bridge's weight limit. The bridge can hold 20,000 pounds. Donna's empty truck weighs 12,000 pounds. She's carrying 20 crates of soda that each weigh 50 pounds, 3 dryers that each weigh 3000 pounds, and twice as much weight in fresh produce as in soda. How much does Donna's fully loaded truck weigh?
A: First find the total weight of the soda by multiplying the number of crates by the weight per crate: 20 crates * 50 pounds / crate = 1000 pounds. Then find the weight of the fresh produce by doubling the weight of the soda: 1000 pounds * 2 = 2000 pounds. Now find the weight of the dryers by multiplying the quantity by the weight per item: 3 dryers * 3000 pounds / dryer = 9000 pounds. Now add the empty truck's weight to the weight of all three groups of products to find the fully loaded weight: 12000 pounds + 1000 pounds + 2000 pounds + 9000 pounds = 24000 pounds. The answer is 24000.
