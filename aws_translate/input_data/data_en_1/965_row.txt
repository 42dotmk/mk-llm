Plot:

Act 1: Justine's Ordinary Life

Justine, a 35 year-old woman, is working a mundane corporate job in a bustling city. Life has become routine, and she finds herself daydreaming about more fulfilling adventures. Battered by the daily toll of her high-stress career, Justine decides to indulge herself in a luxurious, relaxing bath to wash away her troubles.

Act 2: The Transformation

As Justine submerges herself in the bathtub filled with exotic oils and salts, she whispers to herself, "I am clean." As the water cascades over her body, she experiences a sudden surge of energy and begins to notice that her surroundings are morphing, transporting her into another realm. When she finally emerges from the bathtub, she discovers that she has acquired supernatural powers and transformed into an entirely new person.

Act 3: Discovering her Powers

Justine learns to navigate her new powers, which allow her to experience other's emotions, project her thoughts into their minds, and see glimpses into their past and future. At first, she feels like she finally has control over her life, but her powers also make her more vulnerable to other people's distress. Justine becomes increasingly overwhelmed by the emotions she unknowingly absorbs from those around her.

Act 4: The Connection

As she further explores her abilities, Justine stumbles upon an underground community of people who share similar powers. Together, they observe a pattern in their collective experiences – all of them acquired powers after experiencing profound emotional distress. Ironically, this "cleansing" experience has burdened them with the woes of the world.

Act 5: Unraveling the Mystery

As the community grows closer, members begin to share their personal stories and realize that their abilities are interconnected – their powers amplify when they're together. They uncover a legend about an ancient artifact that can enhance or suppress their powers, depending on how it's used.

Act 6: The Hunt

The group goes on a wild hunt to find the ancient artifact, facing numerous challenges and emotional rollercoasters along the journey. Their adventure loops back to the city where their journey began, leading them to the headquarters of a shadowy organization that seeks to control the world.

Act 7: The Battle

Justine and her friends must now use their powers collectively to protect the artifact from the shadow organization. In a high-stakes final battle, they manage to defeat the enemy, but with great costs – members of the group lose their powers, their lives, or are irreversibly changed.

Act 8: Closure

Justine, emotionally scarred by the loss of her friends, chooses to destroy the artifact, releasing a ripple of energy that cleanses her powers and reveals her true self. She comes to accept her past wounds, embracing life without superhuman abilities and learning to find happiness in everyday experiences. The movie concludes with Justine walking away from the ruins of the final battle, a free and resilient woman, taking solace in the adage that cleanliness is truly next to godliness.
