Question 1 and Question 2 are not asking the exact same thing; however, they are related, as both questions are seeking to understand the advantages of using Quora over Google for answers. The difference in the two questions is that Question 1 asks for a comparison between the two platforms, while Question 2 assumes Quora is better and wants an explanation of its advantages. To provide a detailed and long answer addressing both questions, we will first compare Quora and Google for answers and then, if Quora has advantages, point out how it is better than Google.

Quora is a platform where individuals can ask questions and receive answers from other users who have knowledge or experience in the subject matter. It serves as a community-driven platform that enables users to actively engage with each other to obtain specific answers or insights into various topics. On the other hand, Google is a search engine that allows users to search for information from a vast array of online sources including websites, blogs, forums, and more.

Now, let's discuss some of the ways Quora may be considered better than Google for certain kinds of answers:

1. Personalized answers - With Quora, users can ask specific questions and receive customized answers from people with expertise in that area. Google, being a search engine, directs users to existing content from various sources that may not always cater to the user's exact question or specific needs.

2. Expertise-driven insights - Quora has subject matter experts in multiple domains, professionals, and enthusiasts who volunteer answers to those seeking help. This contributes to high-quality, reliable, and well-informed responses, which may not always be the case when browsing through multiple search results on Google.

3. Social interactions - Unlike Google, Quora establishes a sense of community through interactions within its platform. People can have conversations, follow domains of their interest and experts they trust, contribute, and validate answers by upvoting or downvoting them.

4. Focused content curation - Quora enables users to follow topics of interest, rendering a more specific, subject-focused browsing experience. Google, by design, covers the entire internet, which may lead to information overload and lower relevance of search results at times.

However, it is essential to remember that Quora and Google serve different purposes. While Quora is a platform to obtain specific answers and engage with a community, Google is designed to provide access to a vast array of information available on the internet. Quora can be useful for personalized insights and interactive experiences, but Google offers a much broader perspective.

In conclusion, it may not be fair to categorically state that one platform is better than the other since they cater to different needs. Quora can be better for personal insights and community-based information, while Google offers users an unparalleled library of diverse and extensive information from the web. The choice between the two will depend on the context, type of question the user has, and their personal preferences.
