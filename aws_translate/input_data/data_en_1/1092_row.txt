Preparing cupcake pans involves a series of straightforward steps. It's crucial to prep your cupcake pans properly to ensure easy removal of the cupcakes after baking and to prevent cupcakes from sticking to the pan, potentially ruining their shape and texture. 

Here's a detailed, step-by-step process to help achieve this:

1. **Materials Gathered**: Firstly, make sure you've gathered all the things you'll need. This includes the cupcake pan, cupcake liners, non-stick cooking spray (if you choose to use it), a spoon or ice cream scoop, and of course, your cupcake batter.

2. **Choose the Right Pan Size**: Cupcake pans come in standard and mini sizes. Ensure you select the right size for your recipe. If the recipe doesn't specify, a standard size is a safe bet.

3. **Use Cupcake Liners**: Cupcake liners, also known as baking cups or muffin papers, are really easy to use. You simply push them into the holes in the cake pan. Ensure they are fit snugly into the spaces. Liners not only give your cupcakes a neat and uniform shape, but they also make it extremely easy to remove the cupcakes from the pan after baking. Plus, they reduce the amount of cleanup you'll have to do afterwards.

4. **Apply Non-stick Spray (Optional)**: If you don't have cupcake liners at hand, you can use a non-stick cooking spray to grease the cupcake pans. Alternatively, you can use a little bit of butter or oil. Make sure to cover the bottom and the sides of each cup. This will prevent the cupcake batter from sticking to the pan. Over-greasing should be avoided as it can cause the cupcakes to have greasy bottoms.

5. **Preheat Oven**: While you're prepping your cupcake pans, remember to preheat your oven. The specific temperature will depend on your recipe, but 350°F (175°C) is a common baking temperature for cupcakes. Preheating helps ensure that your cupcakes will bake evenly.

6. **Fill the Liners with Batter**: Using a spoon or an ice-cream scoop, fill each cupcake liner or greased cup with batter. You'll typically want to fill each about 2/3 of the way full. This gives the batter enough room to rise without overflowing during baking.

7. **Tap The Pan**: Once you have filled your cupcake liners or cups, you can tap the pan lightly on the counter. This helps to get rid of any air bubbles in the batter and to make sure the batter fills the bottom of each liner completely.

8. **Bake and Cool**: Now you're ready to bake according to your recipe's instructions. Once the cupcakes are done, let them cool in the pan for at least five minutes before removing. This process makes removing the cupcakes from the pan easier and prevents them from falling apart.

9. **Removing the Cupcakes**: After the cupcakes have cooled for a bit, take them out of the cupcake pan. If you used cupcake liners, this step is as simple as lifting them out. If you didn't use cupcake liners, you might need to gently run a butter knife around the edge of each cup before lifting them out.

That's it! With those careful preparations, you're fully equipped to bake your cupcakes with a breeze and enjoy them while preserving their delicious flavours and wonderful shapes!
