Reasoning and answer: 1 truck uses 3 tanks of 150 liters, so a truck can carry 3 tanks per truck * 150 liters = 450 liters per truck. The total amount of water the 3 trucks carry is 3 trucks * 450 liters per truck = 1350 liters.
The answer: 1350

Shelly made 6 / 2 = 3 friends from after - school clubs. She made 6 + 3 = 9 new friends at school this year. Shelly will need 9 * 12 = 108 inches of thread to make each friend a keychain.
The answer: 108
Reverse engineering the question: Shelly makes braided keychains for her friends at school. Each keychain takes 12 inches of thread to braid. This year, she made six friends in classes and half that number from after-school clubs. She wants to make each of them a keychain. How many inches of thread does Shelly need?

Reasoning and answer: Half of the students are playing basketball, which means 20 / 2 = 10 students play basketball. Two - fifths plays volleyball, which leaves us with 20 * 2 / 5 = 8 students. One - tenth play both games, which means 20 * 1 / 10 = 2 students. There are 10 + 8 = 18 students who play basketball or volleyball. Among these 18 students, 2 of them are playing both games, so that means 18 - 2 = 16 students play only one of the two games. So finally, 20 - 16 = 4 students do not play either game.
The answer: 4

Reasoning and answer: Donny was charged $1.5 x 6 = $9 for the small apples. He was charged $2 x 6 = $12 for the medium apples. And he was also charged $8 x 3 = $24 for the big apples. Therefore, Donny has to pay $9 + $12 + $24 = $45 for all the apples.
The answer: 45

Reasoning and answer: From 8:00 to 11:00, Mckenna spends 11:00 - 8:00 = 3 hours at work. When she joins the developers in the conference room for the meeting, she spends an additional 13:00 - 11:00 = 2 hours at work. So far, she has spent 3 + 2 = 5 hours at work. When she works for an additional 2 hours before heading home, her total work hours become 5 + 2 = 7 hours.
The answer: 7
