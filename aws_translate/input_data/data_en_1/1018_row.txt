[Question]Mike wants to buy a new car. He has chosen a red car for $35000. To be able to pay this price, he needs to loan part of the money from the bank, at a rate of 15%. How much money in total will Mike need to pay for the car, if he has to take $20000 from the bank?
[Answer]The rate of the loan is 15%, which means Mike needs to give the bank an additional 20000 * 15 / 100 = $3000. So the car will cost him 35000 + 3000 = $38000. The answer is 38000.
Q: Maci is planning for the new school year and goes to the store to buy pens. She needs ten blue pens and 15 red pens. If a blue pen costs ten cents each and a red pen costs twice as much as the blue pen, how much money does Maci pay for the pens?
A: Maci pays 10 * $0.10 = $1 for the blue pens. Each red pen costs 2 * $0.10 = $0.20. She pays 15 * $0.20 = $3.00 for the red pens. To buy all the pens she needs, Maci pays $3 + $1 = $4. The answer is 4.
Question: In the baking contest, three times as many people voted for the unicorn cake compared to the witch cake, and the number of votes for the dragon cake was 25 more than the number of votes for the witch cake. If 7 people voted for the witch cake, how many votes were cast total?
Answer: First find the number of votes for the unicorn cake: 7 votes * 3 = 21 votes. Then find the number of votes for the dragon cake: 25 votes + 7 votes = 32 votes. Then add the number of votes for each cake to find the total number of votes: 21 votes + 32 votes + 7 votes = 60 votes. The answer is 60.
[Question]A laboratory has 22 beakers of liquid in a fume hood, and 8 of the beakers have copper ions in them. Adding three drops of a solution will turn the liquid in a beaker blue if there are copper ions present. If the beakers are tested one by one for copper ions and 45 drops are used before all 8 beakers with copper ions are found, how many beakers without copper ions were tested?
[Answer]There were 45 / 3 = 15 beakers tested to find all the beakers with copper ions. Thus, 15 - 8 = 7 beakers without copper ions were tested. The answer is 7.
Q: In the city park, there are various attractions for kids and their parents. The entrance ticket to the park is $5, but for each attraction, you have to pay separately - such ticket costs $2 for kids and $4 for parents. How much would a family with 4 children, their parents, and her grandmother pay for visiting the park, and one attraction inside?
A: The whole family consists of 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 persons. The entrance ticket to the park costs the same for every person, so the family would need to pay 7 * 5 = $35 to enter. For visiting the attraction the tickets would cost 4 * 2 = $8 for the kids. Their parents and grandmother would need to pay 3 * 4 = $12. That means a total cost for the family standing at 35 + 8 + 12 = $55. The answer is 55.
