No, these questions do not have the same meaning. They are related in that they both deal with concerns about romantic relationships but are asking different things and seeking different types of advice.

The first question, "What is the point in being a relationship it won't last?" is a more general question regarding the purpose and value of engaging in a romantic relationship that the person believes will not last. This question raises concerns about short-term relationships and their potential benefits and drawbacks.

On the other hand, the second question is more specific and personal: "I think I love my classmate but having a romantic relationship with a schoolmate tops both of our lists of don'ts. (We won't change our school as it is the best one in town.) What should I do?" This question pertains to the individual's situation where they have feelings for a classmate but fear that having a romantic relationship with them might be against both of their principles, and they do not want to change schools.

In response to the first question, it is essential to note that while some may argue that a relationship with an inevitable end may not be worth pursuing, others might contend that there is still value in the experience and growth that can occur during the relationship. Each individual must weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks and determine whether they believe the experience is worthwhile.

As for the second question, you may want to consider the following advice:

1. Evaluate the strength of your feelings: It is essential to determine if your attraction to your classmate is genuine love or just a fleeting infatuation. This can help you decide whether pursuing a relationship is worth it in the long run.

2. Engage in open and honest communication: If you believe your feelings for your classmate are genuine, have an open dialogue with them about your attraction. Discuss the reasons you both have listed romantic relationships with schoolmates as a "do not" and be honest with each other about your concerns, expectations, and priorities.

3. Explore alternative options: You could consider maintaining a friendship or finding support in a platonic relationship while still respecting both of your lists of "don'ts." 

4. Evaluate the consequences: Think about the potential repercussions of pursuing a relationship, such as potential impact on your school performance, friendships, and potential fallout in case of a breakup. Make sure both you and your classmate are willing to accept the potential outcomes.

5. Make a mutual decision: Ultimately, the decision to pursue a romantic relationship should be a mutual one based on open communication, trust, and understanding. If you both agree that the potential drawbacks outweigh the benefits, it may be best to maintain a friendship and focus on your education.

In summary, both questions are about relationships, but they do not have the same meaning. The first question considers the value of a relationship that will not last, while the second is a specific question about navigating a potential romantic relationship with a classmate while adhering to personal principles.
