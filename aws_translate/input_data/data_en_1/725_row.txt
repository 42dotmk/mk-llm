To make homemade instant oatmeal, the method that makes the most sense would involve creating a dry mixture of oats and flavorings that can be easily cooked with boiling water or hot milk. This method is convenient and adaptable, allowing for a variety of flavors to be added according to personal preference. Below is a detailed step-by-step guide to making homemade instant oatmeal.

Materials/Ingredients:

- 3 cups of Quick oats
- 2 tablespoons of powdered milk, powdered almond milk, or powdered coconut milk
- Individual containers (zip-top bags, mason jars, etc.)
- Desired additions like nuts, dried fruit, sweetener, and spices

Procedure:

1. Gather Your Materials: Collect all the needed materials and ingredients before starting. This includes your oats, powdered milk, and your preferred flavor additions. Quick oats are especially recommended because they will soften quicker when hot water is added.

2. Prepare the Oats: In a large bowl, blend 1 cup of your quick oats until it forms a fine flour. This step aids in the quick absorption of water when rehydrating your instant oatmeal, creating a creamier end result. 

3. Combine the Ingredients: After the oats are blended, mix the oat flour with the remaining 2 cups of unblended quick oats in your large bowl. Add 2 tablespoons of powdered milk (regular, almond, or coconut) to the oats. This will help make your oatmeal creamier once cooked. 

4. Customize Your Oatmeal: This is where you get to add some flavor to your oatmeal. You can add a variety of sweeteners such as sugar, honey, stevia or maple syrup as well as spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg or pumpkin pie spice. Consider adding chopped dried fruits like raisins, cranberries, apricots, or nuts like almonds, walnuts or pecans for extra texture and nutrients. Choose your own combinations to suit your taste.

5. Portion the Oatmeal: Divide the oatmeal mixture into individual bags or mason jars. These work great for one or two servings of oatmeal. Each serving should be about half a cup. 

6. Prepare the Oatmeal: To prepare your homemade instantaneous oatmeal, simply add your portioned oatmeal mixture to a bowl, heat up 3/4 to 1 cup of water or milk until it's hot but not boiling, and then pouring it over your instantaneous oatmeal. Let it sit until the oats have absorbed all the liquid (about 2-3 minutes), stir, and enjoy.

7. Alternate Cooking Method: If you prefer, you can also cook the oatmeal in the microwave. Place your oatmeal and liquid in a microwave-safe dish, then microwave on high for 1-2 minutes. Make sure to watch carefully to prevent it from boiling over. 

This method for homemade instant oatmeal is practical because it's just as fast as using store-bought packets but allows for customization to everyone's taste and dietary needs. It also offers a more economical and less wasteful alternative, reducing the need for single-use packaging. This, combined with the ability to make bulk quantities in advance, makes homemade instantaneous oatmeal an excellent option for busy mornings. With this method, you'll have a quick, delicious, and nutritious breakfast ready in no time.
