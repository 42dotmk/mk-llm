She buys a $4.00 latte in the morning for 5 days so that’s 4 * 5 = $20.00. She buys a $2.00 iced coffee 3 days a week so that’s 2 * 3 = $6.00. In one week she spends $20.00 on lattes and $6.00 on iced coffee for a total of 20 + 6 = $26.00. After 1 year, 52 weeks, she spends 52 * 26 = $1,352.00. She wants to cut her coffee spending by 25% so that will save her .25 * 1352 = $338.00.
The answer: 338
Reverse engineering the question: Martha buys 1 latte for $4.00 every morning, 5 days a week. 3 days a week, she buys an iced coffee for $2.00. Her goal for the entire year is to cut her coffee spending by 25%. How much will she save?

Reasoning and answer: Every other tree is half the trees, so there will be 18 / 2 = 9 fruit trees planted. The association is planting three kinds of fruit trees, so they will plant 9 / 3 = 3 of each kind of tree.
The answer: 3
What was the question?
Question: A neighborhood association decided to plant a tree on every street. There are eighteen streets in the neighborhood. The association wanted every other tree to be a fruit tree, and they agreed to plant equal numbers of plum, pear, and apricot trees. How many of each kind of tree will they plant?

Hannah found twice as many as Helen, so there are 2 + 1 = 3 units of eggs. There were 63 Easter eggs total and there are 3 units of eggs so 63 / 3 = 21 easter eggs per unit. So if Helen found 21 eggs and Hannah found twice as many, then Hannah found 2 * 21 = 42 Easter eggs.
The answer: 42
Reverse engineering the question: There were 63 Easter eggs in the yard. Hannah found twice as many as Helen. How many Easter eggs did Hannah find?

Reasoning and answer: First, subtract the two tourists the anacondas got from the initial 30 tourists: 30 - 2 = 28. Next, divide 28 by two to find out how many tourists got poisoned: 28 / 2 = 14. Now figure out how many of the 14 poisoned tourists recovered: 14 / 7 = 2. The total number of surviving tourists is 14 + 2 = 16.
The answer: 16
What was the question?
Question: A group of 30 tourists sets out on a walking tour of the rainforest. Two tourists are eaten by anacondas, then half the remaining tourists try to pet poisonous dart frogs and get poisoned. If only 1/7 of the poisoned tourists recovered, how many tourists are left at the end of the tour?

First find the cost per member of the hardcover books: $30 / book * 6 books = $180. Then find the cost per member of the paperback books: $12 / book * 6 books = $72. Then find the total cost per member: $180 + $72 + $150 = $402 / member. Now find the total amount of money by multiplying the cost per member by the number of members: $402 / member * 6 members = $2412.
The answer: 2412
Reverse engineering the question: Niles is collecting his book club's annual fees. Each of the six members pays $150/year towards snacks, plus $30 each for six hardcover books and $12 each for six paperback books. How much money does Niles collect in total?

The cost of the ice cream is 10 × $4 = $40. The cost of the frozen yoghurt is 4 × $1 = $4. Caleb spent $40 − $4 = $36 more on ice cream than on frozen yogurt.
