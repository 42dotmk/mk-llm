Q: Calvin signed up for a gym training service to lose some pounds. If he weighed 250 pounds to start with and lost 8 pounds every month during the training sessions, what's his weight after one year?
A: Since Calvin loses 10 pounds every month, his total weight loss after one year is 12 * 8 = 96 pounds. Calvin weighs 250 - 96 = 154 pounds after a year of hitting the gym. The answer is 154.
Question: Ryan is looking for people to crowdfund his new business idea. If the average person funds $10 to a project they're interested in, how many people will Ryan have to recruit to fund a $1,000 business if he has $200 already?
Answer: First, we need to determine how much money Ryan needs to hit his goal which we find by subtracting his available cash from his target, performing 1000 - 200 = 800 dollars needed. Since the average person contributes $10 when crowdfunding, this means he needs to find 800 / 10 = 80 people to fund his business well enough for him to hit his goal. The answer is 80.
[Question]Laura wants to bake a cake for her mother. She checks the recipe and the pantry and sees that she needs to buy 2 cups of flour, 2 cups of sugar, a cup of butter, and two eggs. The flour costs $4. The sugar costs $2. The eggs cost $.5, and the butter costs $2.5. When she is done baking it, she cuts the cake into 6 slices. Her mother enjoys a piece the first two days. But on the third day, they discover that Kevin, her dog, ate the rest of the cake. How much did the amount the dog ate cost?
[Answer]The cake cost $9 in total because 4 + 2 + .5 + 2.5 = 9. Each slice costs $1.5 because 9 / 6 = 1.5. The dog ate 4 slices because 6 - 2 = 4. The amount the dog ate cost $6 because 4 x 1.5 = 6. The answer is 6.
Q: Danielle wants to make her own popsicles. She finds out she needs popsicle sticks, molds, and juice. She has $10 for supplies. She buys one set of molds for $3 and a pack of 100 popsicle sticks for $1. Each bottle of juice makes 20 popsicles and costs $2. How many popsicle sticks will she be left with if she makes as many as she can?
A: She has $6 left after buying initial supplies because 10 - 3 - 1 = 6. She can buy 3 bottles of juice because 6 / 2 = 3. She can make 60 popsicles because 20 x 3 = 60. She has 40 sticks left because 100 - 6 60 = 40. The answer is 40.
Question: Four cats live in the old grey house at the end of the road. Their names are Puffy, Scruffy, Buffy, and Juniper. Puffy has three times more whiskers than Juniper, but half as many as Scruffy. Buffy has the same number of whiskers as the average number of whiskers on the three other cats. If Juniper has 12 whiskers. how many whiskers does Buffy have?
Answer: If Juniper has 12 whiskers, then Puffy has 3 * 12 = 36 whiskers. Since Puffy has half as many whiskers and Scruffy, then Scruffy has 36 * 2 = 72 whiskers. Since the number of whiskers on Buffy is the average between 12, 36, and 72 whiskers, then he has (12 + 36 + 72) / 3 = 40 whiskers. The answer is 40.
