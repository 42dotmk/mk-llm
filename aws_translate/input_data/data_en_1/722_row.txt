Based on the context provided, you would well up during the fireworks and train ride at Disneyland for a combination of emotional reasons, primarily rooted in nostalgia and the creation of new memories with loved ones. These emotional responses are influenced by the following factors:

1. Connection to past memories with your father: Given that your father has recently passed away, the experiences at Disneyland might evoke strong memories of the time you spent with him in the same environment. Theme parks, like Disneyland, are filled with shared experiences, laughter, and fun for families and friends. It is natural for you to associate these events with the unforgettable moments you had with your father. As a result, the fireworks and train ride could trigger emotional reactions—such as welling up—due to the bittersweet remembrance of the joyful times you had with your dad.

2. Creation of new memories with your daughters: Experiencing Disneyland with your daughters signifies the passing on of cherished traditions and the creation of new memories as a family. Seeing your children delight in the magic of Disneyland can evoke strong emotions, especially when it reminds you of your own childhood experiences with your father. The fireworks and train ride, being symbolic representations of these special memories, might cause you to well up as you recognize the significance of sharing similar experiences with your own children.

3. Disneyland as a symbol of happiness and family bonding: Disneyland is well-known for being a place that brings people together and encourages family bonding and togetherness. The atmosphere of the park, the enchanting attractions, and the shared experiences serve as poignant reminders of the importance of maintaining strong connections with our loved ones. As you take part in the spectacle of the fireworks and the train ride, you might be overcome with emotion as Disneyland has a unique ability to amplify feelings of happiness, love, and appreciation for the special moments we spend with our family and friends.

4. Emotional impact of the fireworks and train ride: Both the fireworks display and train ride may hold emotional significance in and of themselves. Fireworks are a symbol of celebration, wonder, and awe, while the train ride may represent a journey and the passing of time. Witnessing these events might evoke deep emotional reactions due to their inherent beauty and the feelings they evoke. This, combined with the emotional connections to your father and the new memories being created with your daughters, would likely make these experiences particularly poignant and lead you to well up during these special moments.

In conclusion, the feeling of being overwhelmed by emotions during the fireworks and the train ride at Disneyland is likely a result of the connection between your past memories with your father, the ongoing formation of new memories with your daughters, and the powerful impact of the theme park's atmosphere and attractions. The amalgamation of these factors creates an emotional experience that can indeed make Disneyland a very special place.
