[Question]Chance boarded a plane departing from London to New York at 6:00 a.m. ET on Monday. He arrived in New York 18 hours later. If he took another plane flying to Cape town the day he arrived in New York and arrived in Cape town at 10:00 a.m ET on Tuesday, calculate the number of hours his flight took from New York to cape town.
[Answer]Eighteen hours later, after departing from London, Chance arrived in New York at 6:00 + 18 hours = 00:00 on Tuesday. If he arrived in cape town at 10:00 p.m. on Tuesday, his flight took 10:00 - 00:00 = 10 hours. The answer is 10.
Q: Grace started her own landscaping business. She charges $6 an hour for mowing lawns, $11 for pulling weeds and $9 for putting down mulch. In September she mowed lawns for 63 hours, pulled weeds for 9 hours and put down mulch for 10 hours. How much money did she earn in September?
A: Grace mowed lawns for 63 hours at $6 / hour, so earned 63 * 6 = $378. Grace pulled weeds for 9 hours at $11 / hour, so earned 9 * 11 = $99. Grace put down mulch for 10 hours at $9 / hour, so earned 10 * 9 = $90. During September Grace earned $378 + $99 + $90 = $567. The answer is 567.
Question: Josh and Anna were both born on August 17th, but in different years. To consolidate celebrations they also got married on August 17 when Josh turned 22. If today they're celebrating 30 years of marriage and their combined age is exactly 5 times what Josh's age was when they married, how old was Anna when they got married?
Answer: We know that Josh must be 30 years older than his age when they got married, therefore he is 30 + 22 = 52 years old today. If their current combined age is 5 times the age Josh was when they married (22), then their total combined age is 5 * 22 = 110 years. That means that Anna must be 110 - 52 = 58 years old today. If they married 30 years ago, Anna must have been 58 - 30 = 28 years old when they married. The answer is 28.
[Question]Heloise has dogs and cats in the ratio of 10:17, with the total number of pets being 189. If she gives 10 dogs to her friend Janet, how many dogs does she remain with altogether?
[Answer]The total ratio for the number of cats and dogs that Heloise has is 10 + 17 = 27. From the ratios, the fraction representing the number of dogs is 10 / 27, and this represents 10 / 27 * 189 = 70 dogs. If Heloise gives 10 of her dogs to Janet, she remains with 70 - 10 = 60 dogs. The answer is 60.
Q: Mark has two pets, a hare that runs 10 feet/second and a turtle that crawls 1 foot/second. If they're going to run a 20 foot-race, how much of a head start (in seconds) does the turtle need to finish in a tie?
A: We can find how long the hare spends running by dividing the distance of the race by the hare's speed: 20 feet / 10 feet / second = 2 seconds. We can do the same for the turtle: 20 feet / 1 foot / second = 20 seconds. Finally, subtract the hare's run time from the turtle's run time to find the length of the head start the turtle needs: 20 seconds - 2 seconds = 18 seconds. The answer is 18.
