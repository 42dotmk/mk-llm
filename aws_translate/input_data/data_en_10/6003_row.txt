Q: Thomas has been saving $40 in the bank every month for six years. His friend Joseph has been saving 2/5 times less money per month. How much money are they having in their savings account altogether?
A: Thomas has been saving for six years, and since each year has 12 months, he has been making savings for 6 * 12 = 72 months. Since Thomas has been saving $40 in the bank every month for six years, he has saved 72 * $40 = $2880. Joseph has been saving 2 / 5 times less money per month than Thomas, meaning he has been saving 2 / 5 * $40 = $16 less per month. The total amount of money that Joseph has been saving per month is $40 - $16 = $24. In six years, Joseph has saved $24 * 72 = $1728. Together, they have saved a total of $2880 + $1728 = $4608. The answer is 4608.
Question: On a four-day trip, Carrie drove 135 miles the first day, 124 miles more the second day, 159 miles the third day, and 189 miles the fourth day. If she had to charge her phone every 106 miles, how many times did she charge her phone for the whole trip?
Answer: Carrie drove 135 + 124 = 259 miles on the second day. Carrie drove 135 + 259 + 159 + 189 = 742 miles for the whole trip. Carries charged her phone 742 / 106 = 7 times. The answer is 7.
[Question]Brian likes to read books. He read one book that had 20 chapters, two books that had 15 chapters each, and one book that had half the chapters of the three previous books put together. How many chapters of books did Brian read?
[Answer]Brian read two books with 15 chapters, so he read 2 * 15 = 30 chapters. He also read a book with 20 chapters, bringing the total for the first three to 30 + 20 = 50 chapters. He then read a book with half the chapters of his cumulative total so far, so it had 50 / 2 = 25 chapters. In total, he read 30 + 20 + 25 = 75 chapters. The answer is 75.
Q: Charles is wondering how much chocolate milk he can make with all the supplies he finds in the fridge. He is going to keep drinking 8-ounce glasses until he uses up all the ingredients. Each glass must contain 6.5 ounces of milk and 1.5 ounces of chocolate syrup. If he has 130 ounces of milk and 60 ounces of chocolate syrup, how many total ounces ounce of chocolate milk will he drink?
A: He has enough milk for 20 glasses of chocolate milk because 130 / 6.5 = 20. He has enough syrup for 40 glasses of chocolate milk because 60 / 1.5 = 40. He can make 20 glasses of chocolate milk because 20 < 40. He will drink 160 ounces of chocolate milk because 20 x 8 = 160. The answer is 160.
Question: Lucius owns a small business and spends $10 every day on ingredients. He then makes a portion of French Fries and a portion of Poutine and sells them to the market, paying ten percent of his weekly income as tax. If the price of French fries is $12 and the price of Poutine is $8, how much does he earn every week after paying the taxes, selling all his products, and buying all the ingredients?
Answer: He earns $12 + $8 = $20 after selling the French fries and Poutine every day. So, he earns $20 x 7 = $140 every week. And the total amount he pays for the taxes is $140 x 0.10 = $14. So, his income after paying the weekly taxes is $140 - $14 = $126. Lucius spends $10 x 7 = $70 for the ingredients every week. Therefore, his total income every week after buying all the ingredients and paying the taxes is $126 - $70 = $56. The answer is 56.
