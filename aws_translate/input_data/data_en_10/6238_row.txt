Both questions ask for recommendations on the best horror movies, but they differ slightly in their focus. The first question specifically asks for the best horror movies that will keep you up at night, implying that the film should be particularly frightening or unsettling. The second question simply requests some top horror movies, without necessarily focusing on their ability to leave you scared through the night.

Given the slight difference, I will provide recommendations to cater to both of the questions:

For horror movies that will keep you up at night, I recommend the following:

1. The Exorcist (1973) - Directed by William Friedkin, this classic horror film tells the story of a demon-possessed girl and the attempts to exorcise her.

2. Rosemary's Baby (1968) - Directed by Roman Polanski, this psychological horror movie revolves around a pregnant woman who becomes increasingly paranoid about the safety of her unborn child.

3. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) - Directed by Wes Craven, this film introduces the iconic character Freddy Krueger, a supernatural killer who preys on teenagers in their dreams.

4. The Ring (2002) - Directed by Gore Verbinski, this American remake of the Japanese film "Ringu" tells the story of a cursed videotape that causes anyone who watches it to die in seven days.

5. Hereditary (2018) - Directed by Ari Aster, this unnerving film focuses on the disturbing and tragic events that unfold after the death of a family's secretive grandmother.

6. The Babadook (2014) - Directed by Jennifer Kent, this psychological horror film tells the story of a mother and son who are haunted by a mysterious and sinister presence in their home.

7. The Conjuring (2013) - Directed by James Wan, this movie is based on the real-life investigations of paranormal experts Ed and Lorraine Warren. It focuses on their experiences with a family dealing with an evil entity in their home.

For some more general best horror movies, consider the following:

1. Psycho (1960) - Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, this iconic thriller/horror movie is known for its shocking plot twists and infamous shower scene.

2. The Shining (1980) - Directed by Stanley Kubrick and based on the novel by Stephen King, this film follows a family's terrifying stay at an isolated hotel during the off-season.

3. Get Out (2017) - Directed by Jordan Peele, this social-thriller tells the story of a young black man who discovers a horrifying secret when he meets his white girlfriend's family.

4. Scream (1996) - Directed by Wes Craven, this meta-horror film offers a fresh take on the slasher genre while also paying homage to its roots.

5. The Silence of the Lambs (1991) - Directed by Jonathan Demme, this psychological horror film features the iconic characters Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling in a chilling battle of wits.

6. It Follows (2014) - Directed by David Robert Mitchell, this film deals with a supernatural entity that relentlessly pursues its victims after a curse is passed on through sexual contact.

7. The Witch (2016) - Directed by Robert Eggers, this chilling film is set in the 17th century and follows a Puritan family facing mysterious occurrences and witchcraft.

In conclusion, both questions seek recommendations for the best horror movies, but they have slightly different emphases. The distinction between them lies in the degree of fear they're looking for in the film recommendations. Regardless, both queries can be addressed with a variety of classic and modern horror movies that cater to different interests and levels of fear.
