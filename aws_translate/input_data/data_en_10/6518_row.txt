The Governor, a significant antagonist in the Walking Dead, is a character from the popular comic book series and television show. He is portrayed as the ruthless and cunning leader of the Woodbury community and clashes with Rick Grimes and his group of survivors. The Governor's death is shown differently in the comics and television series, so I will discuss both instances to provide a comprehensive understanding of the events surrounding his demise.

In the comic series:

The Governor, whose real name is Brian Blake, meets his end in issue #48. During an assault on the prison where Rick and the other survivors have established their base, The Governor is ultimately responsible for the death of several characters, including Lori and Judith Grimes. In his attempt to kill Rick and take over the prison, he orders the prison fences to be destroyed, thus allowing hordes of zombies to invade the compound.

While The Governor remains focused on successfully capturing the prison, his own people turn against him. During this intense battle, Lilly Caul, one of his Woodbury soldiers, realizes the terrible acts they have been carrying out under The Governor's orders. She becomes outraged after witnessing the deaths of innocent lives, including Lori and Judith.

It's during this moment, driven by her anger and desire for justice, that Lilly takes matters into her own hands. She shoots and kills The Governor, thus ending his reign of terror. Following this event, Lilly and other remaining residents of Woodbury join forces with Rick's group to create a stronger community.

In the television series:

The Governor, played by actor David Morrissey, has a slightly different storyline in the television series, but his ultimate demise is not unlike that depicted in the comic books. After the initial confrontation with Rick's group and the fall of Woodbury, The Governor becomes a fugitive and eventually assumes a new identity as "Brian Heriot." He forms a new group and attempts to take over the prison once again.

In season 4, episode 8, titled "Too Far Gone," The Governor initiates a fierce battle against the prison group. He captures Michonne and Hershel as hostages and demands that Rick's group vacate the compound. Despite Rick's pleas for peace, The Governor is adamant and proceeds to execute Hershel.

Seeing this horrific act, Lilly, who was previously involved with The Governor romantically, finally understands the true nature of his malicious intent. While The Governor and Rick engage in a brutal fight, Michonne manages to wound The Governor by stabbing him through his chest with her sword. Michonne lets him suffer instead of finishing him off, as she knows that he is already a dying man.

It is then that Lilly steps forward, full of disappointment and anger towards the man she once knew. She delivers the final blow, shooting The Governor in the head and ending his life. This scene highlights the recurring theme of revenge and retribution that permeates the storyline of the Walking Dead and underscores the eventual consequences of The Governor's selfish actions and manipulative tactics.

In conclusion, The Governor, a notorious and ruthless antagonist in the Walking Dead, is killed by Lilly Caul. Although the circumstances leading to his death vary slightly in the comic books and television series, Lilly's act of vengeance is consistent in both narratives. This event is a turning point that leads to the eventual merging of the remaining Woodbury residents with Rick's group, signaling a new era of cooperation and relative stability in the post-apocalyptic world.
