Title: Spirited Republican Responses to Obama's Stance on Labeling ISIS an 'Islamic' Terror Group

The United States and the world watched with increasing concern as the former President Barack Obama consistently refrained from labeling ISIS as an 'Islamic' terror group. This policy was met with vehement opposition from leading Republican figures, who accused him of 'Orwellian doublespeak'. President Obama's reluctance to label the global terror threat for what it is, according to his critics, reflects a total misunderstanding of the exact nature of the enemy that the free world confronts. This article will examine the criticism painted against the former President by leading Republican figures.

Senator Ted Cruz, a persistent critic of Obama, blasted his 'bizarre Orwellian doublespeak' and criticized his administration's refusal to acknowledge that ISIS was an 'Islamic' terror group. According to Cruz, a refusal to acknowledge an enemy for what it is represents a dangerous misunderstanding. In the political games of semantics and connotations, the world could lose its ability to effectively combat the burgeoning problem that is terrorism, he argued.

Former Texas Governor, Rick Perry, joined the fray, fiercely criticizing Obama’s rhetoric. 'Egypt and Jordan recognize that they are at war with radical Islam; isn't it about time that our president proclaimed the same?' These words point to Perry's frustration over the perceived hesitation by the Obama administration to robustly tackle the threat of ISIS terrorism. He argues that pertinent allies in the Middle East like Egypt and Jordan have already recognized the seriousness of the threat, raising ethical questions about America's leadership under the Obama administration.

Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush presented another critical perspective in this debate, slamming the Obama administration's stance. According to Bush, the administration was in possession of a 'total misunderstanding of what this Islamic terrorist threat is.' These remarks underscore the perception of a fundamental disconnect between Obama's understanding of the terrorist threat and its ground realities – a chasm that could have severe implications in terms of policy and action.

Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, meanwhile, put a more direct blame on another prominent Democratic figure – Hillary Clinton. He claimed that 'Hillary’s war in Libya allowed thousands of surface-to-air missiles to fall into the hands of radical Islamists.' Paul’s denunciation comes with an insurgent critic of the Obama-Clinton's foreign policy and its unanticipated and disastrous consequences, which, as many argue, have largely contributed to the creation of a fertile ground for terrorism.

Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal provided a different perspective on the crisis. He argued against the Obama administration's foreign aid policies – saying 'We don’t need a war on international poverty; we need a war on the evil that is radical Islamic terrorism.' What the U.S. needs, Jindal suggested, is not a global effort to fight poverty, but a focused and unerring war against the actual threat – that is, radical Islamic terrorism.

In conclusion, the Republican leaders' criticism of the Obama administration's terminology policy in regards to ISIS clearly reflects a fundamental difference in perception and approach towards handling the rising tide of global terrorism. The refusal of Obama, in their eyes, to label ISIS as an 'Islamic' terror group becomes symbolic of a much larger failure – that of grappling with the real nature of the threat.
