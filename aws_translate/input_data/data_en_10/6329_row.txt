This remarkable video shows the dramatic transformation in a mother with cerebral palsy after she smokes cannabis to relieve her symptoms. Jacqueline Patterson, from Kansas City, Missouri, has a severe stutter and suffers incredible pain because of her condition. She has found that marijuana is the only thing that really helps - but each time she buys or smokes it, she runs the risk of losing custody of her four children. Despite marijuana being legal for medical reasons in 20 states, it is not legal in Kansas City where Ms Patterson lives. But because of her debilitating symptoms, she says using the drug actually makes her better mother. Before she smokes cannabis, she seriously struggles to speak. Afterwards, she speaks calmly and with no problems at all. In the video, she explains: 'I was born with cerebral palsy and a severe stutter - which has got to be one of the most stigmatising disabilities invented by God. It's very humiliating. 'My right side of my body is much noticeably weaker than my left and my right arm is always painfully tense. 'I went through my entire childhood in pain because I couldn't move my muscles.' She realised from the first time she smoked cannabis that it eased her symptoms. In a letter to the Kansas City Star, she said: 'I. was born with cerebral palsy and discovered early on that cannabis. mitigated the most painful physical and emotional manifestations of my. disorder. Ms Patterson has found that marijuana is the only thing that really helps her symptoms. Despite it being legal for medical reasons in 20 states, it is not legal in Kansas City, Missouri, where she lives (file picture) 'I later learned that cannabis can help stutterers speak more clearly and that decades ago, doctors discovered the herbâ€™s ability to alleviate muscle spasms, from which I also suffer.' In the film, viewers meet Ms Patterson when she hasn't smoked marijuana for three days. Her stutter means it can take several seconds for her to pronounce a word. Driving into downtown Kansas City to look for the drug, she explains: 'I smoke to be the mother my children deserve - they are really cool kids. 'Being a good mother to my children is the most important thing in the world to me. Cerebral. palsy is an umbrella term used to describe damage to the brain that. occurs before, during or after birth. birth. It is a condition that. affects muscle control and movement. People with cerebral palsy often. have other related conditions or problems, including: difficulties. speaking or understanding other people speak, incontinence, learning. difficulties, visual impairment and hearing impairment. 'I hate the way I stutter and it's the most effective treatment I have found. 'But if I were to get busted buying or smoking marijuana there is a possibility I could lose my children.' Back home, after three hits of the drug, she is able to speak completely normally. Speaking about the remarkable difference, she says: 'The third hit is when I begin to feel the tension dissipate. 'It really helps my speech - I feel much calmer, much less rushed and I feel like I can control the muscles that I couldn't before I smoked. 'It's kinda nice and I don't make as many funny faces.' While there is little scientific evidence for the benefits of marjuana in cerebral palsy, it is used by some. people living with multiple sclerosis to relieve pain, tremor, and. muscle spasticity to provide a feeling of 'looseness'.
