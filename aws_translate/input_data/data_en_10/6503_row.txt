Question: If eight movie tickets cost 2 times as much as one football game ticket, and each movie ticket is sold at $30, calculate the total amount of money Chandler will pay if he buys eight movie tickets and five football game tickets.
Answer: If each movie ticket is sold at $30, the cost of buying eight movie tickets is 8 * $30 = $240. Since eight movie tickets cost 2 times as much as one football game ticket, the cost of buying one football game ticket is $240 / 2 = $120. Buying five football game tickets will cost 5 * $120 = $600. The total cost of buying eight movie tickets and five football game tickets is $600 + $240 = $840. The answer is 840.
[Question]Malcolm is trying to find the fastest walk to school and is currently comparing two routes. In the first route, he walks for 6 minutes uphill, walks for twice this amount of time along a path, then finishes the journey in a third of the time it took to walk the first two stages. In the second route, he walks along a flat path for 14 minutes, then finishes the walk in twice this amount of time. In minutes, how much longer was the second route compared with the first?
[Answer]In the first route, Malcolm spends 6 minutes * 2 = 12 minutes walking along the path. So in total, the first two stages of this route take him 6 + 12 = 18 minutes. This means the final part of the journey took him 18 / 3 = 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time it takes to walk the first route is 18 + 6 = 24 minutes. In the second route, the second stage takes him 14 * 2 = 28 minutes. So the second route takes a total of 28 + 14 = 42 minutes to walk. The second route therefore takes an extra 42 minutes for the second route â€“ 24 minutes for the first route = 18 minutes. The answer is 18.
Q: Dan can get to the center of a lollipop in 58 licks. Micheal does it in 63 licks. Sam & David each take 70 licks to get to the center of a lollipop while Lance only needs 39 licks. What is the average amount of licks it takes to get to the center of a lollipop?
A: Dan takes 58 licks, Michael takes 63, Sam takes 70, David takes 70 and Lance takes 39 for a total of 58 + 63 + 70 + 70 + 39 = 300 licks. There are 5 people and the total amount of licks is 300 so the average is 300 / 5 = 60 licks to get to the center of a lollipop. The answer is 60.
Question: Magdalena has an apple tree on their farm, producing very few apples each year for a while now. However, this year, the apple tree yield was excellent, and it grew 200 apples. Magdalena picked 1/5 of the fruits on the first day, twice that number on the second day, and 20 more apples than he picked on the first day on the third day. Calculate the total number of apples remaining in the tree.
Answer: Magdalena picked 1 / 5 * 200 apples = 40 apples on the first day. On the second day, she picked 2 * 40 apples = 80 apples from the tree. The total number of apples that he picked on the third day is 40 apples + 20 apples = 60 apples. In total, she picked 40 apples + 80 apples + 60 apples = 180 apples in the three days. The total number of apples remaining in the tree is 200 apples - 180 apples = 20 apples. The answer is 20.
