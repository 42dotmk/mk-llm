Reasoning and answer: Cole has to pay 3 * 9 = $27 for one side of the side fence. For the shared left fence, he has to pay two - thirds of 27, so he has to pay 27 * 2 / 3 = $18. The shared back fence will cost 3 * 18 = $54. He has to pay for half the back fence, so it will cost 54 / 2 = $27. Thus, Cole has to pay 18 + 27 + 27 = $72 for the fence.
The answer: 72

Question: Cole wants to fence his backyard on three sides. His backyard is 9 feet along the sides and 18 feet along the back. The neighbor behind him agreed to pay for half of their shared side of his fence, and the neighbor on his left agreed to pay for a third of their shared side. Fencing costs $3 per foot. How much does Cole have to pay for the fence?

We can find how long the hare spends running by dividing the distance of the race by the hare's speed: 20 feet / 10 feet / second = 2 seconds. We can do the same for the turtle: 20 feet / 1 foot / second = 20 seconds. Finally, subtract the hare's run time from the turtle's run time to find the length of the head start the turtle needs: 20 seconds - 2 seconds = 18 seconds.
The answer: 18
Reverse engineering the question: Mark has two pets, a hare that runs 10 feet/second and a turtle that crawls 1 foot/second. If they're going to run a 20 foot-race, how much of a head start (in seconds) does the turtle need to finish in a tie?

Reasoning and answer: If the first page had 5 drawings, and the number of drawings on each page increased by five, the second page had 5 + 5 = 10. The total number of drawings in the first 2 pages is 5 + 10 = 15. On the third page, the number of drawings increased to 10 + 5 = 15. The first three pages have a total of 15 + 15 = 30 drawings. The fourth page had 15 + 5 = 20 drawings. There are 30 + 20 = 50 drawings on the first four pages. The fifth page also had an extra 5 more drawings than the fourth page, totaling 20 + 5 = 25. For the first five pages, Janice saw 25 + 50 = 75 pages.
The answer: 75

Question: Janice opened an art book that she had found in the library and found 5 drawings on the first page. After opening the first ten pages, she realized that the number of drawings on each page increased by five after every page. How many drawings were in the first five pages?

Mikaela would use 16 / 4 = 4 containers of paint per wall. To paint 3 walls, she will use 3 * 4 = 12 containers. After using 1 container for the ceiling, she will have 16 - 12 - 1 = 3 containers of paint left over.
The answer: 3
Reverse engineering the question: Mikaela was repainting her bathroom. She bought 16 containers of paint to cover the four equally-sized walls. At the last minute, she decided to put tile on one wall in the bathroom and paint flowers on the ceiling with one container of paint instead. How many containers of paint will she have left over?

Reasoning and answer: The rectangular tables seat 7 * 10 = 70 pupils. The square tables will seat 90 - 70 = 20 pupils. The library needs 20 / 4 = 5 square tables.
The answer: 5

Question: A library has 7 rectangular tables and the remaining tables will be square tables. A rectangular table seats 10 pupils while a square table seats 4 pupils. How many square tables are needed so that 90 pupils can read at the same time?

Reasoning and answer: First find the number of tadpoles Trent released: 180 tadpoles * .75 = 135 tadpoles. Then subtract the number he let go from the total number to find the number of tadpoles he keeps: 180 tadpoles - 135 tadpoles = 45 tadpoles.
The answer: 45
