Question: Joseph and his friends watched two movies in his house. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long while the second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first. Before the movies, they spent 10 minutes making popcorn and twice as long making fries. How long, in hours, did it take Joseph and his friends to cook and watch the movies?
Answer: The first movie was 60 + 30 = 90 minutes long since an hour has 60 minutes. The second movie was 90 + 30 = 120 minutes long. It took them a total of 90 + 120 = 210 minutes to watch the two movies. It took them 10 x 2 = 20 minutes to cook the fries. Thus, it took them a total of 10 + 20 = 30 minutes to cook. So, they spent 210 + 30 = 240 minutes watching the movies and cooking. In hours, this is equal to 240 / 60 = 4 hours. The answer is 4.

Q: Randy just turned 12 and started playing the piano. His friend Sheila told him about the 10,000-hour rule which says, after 10,000 hours of practice, you become an expert or master in your field. If Randy wants to become a piano expert before he is 20, how many hours a day will he need to practice if he practices every day, Monday – Friday, and takes two weeks off for vacation each year?
A: Randy has 20 – 12 = 8 years until he is 20. He must practice 10,000 hours / 8 years = 1,250 hours a year to become an expert. There are 52 weeks in a year – 2 weeks of vacation Randy plans to take = 50 weeks of practice for Randy. Randy will practice Monday – Friday, which is 5 days a week, so 50 weeks x 5 days = 250 days of practice each year. Randy will need to practice 1250 hours / 250 days = 5 hours each day. The answer is 5.
Question: Conner has a dune buggy that he rides in the desert. On flat sand, it can ride at a speed of 60 miles per hour. When traveling on downhill slopes, it can race at 12 miles per hour faster than it can when it is on flat sand. And when riding on an uphill inclined slow, it travels at a speed 18 miles per hour slower than when it is riding on flat sand. If Conner rides his dune buggy one-third of the time on flat sand, one-third of the time on uphill slopes, and one-third of the time on downhill slopes, what is his average speed in miles per hour?
Answer: 12 mph faster than 60mph is 60 + 12 = 72 mph. 18 mph slower than 60 mph is 60 - 18 = 42 mph. If he spends 1 / 3 of the time at each of these three speeds, then he averages (60 + 72 + 42) / 3 = 58 mph. The answer is 58.
[Question]Jed is 10 years older than Matt. In 10 years, Jed will be 25 years old. What is the sum of their present ages?
[Answer]Jed is 25 - 10 = 15 years old now. So, Matt is 15 - 10 = 5 years old now. Thus, the sum of their present ages is 15 + 5 = 20. The answer is 20.
