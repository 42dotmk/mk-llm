Title: Toxically Hired

Genre: Action-Comedy

Logline: In a struggling city dwelled in danger and most importantly, toxic waste; two best friends – Dooley and Kene – accidentally apply for work at a mysterious toxic waste dump, only to find themselves in a wild, life-altering adventure filled with dangerous mobsters, a secret formula, and a city to save.

Act 1: 

- Dooley and Kene are childhood best friends who fell short of luck in a city where jobs are scarce, and life is tough. The city has recently suffered from a massive toxic waste spill that led to environmental chaos, and its residents covered in junk with no hope for revival.
- Desperate for work, they stumble across an ambiguous advertisement for "hazardous materials handlers" and decide to take the plunge and apply for the job.
- Oblivious to the dark intentions and the danger behind the job posting, they soon find themselves employed at a secret, hazardous, and illegal waste dump.

Act 2: 

- As Dooley and Kene start their new job, they discover that they are involved in a criminal organization led by a menacing mob boss – Vittorio Vargas. Vittorio and his partner in crime, a quirky yet highly intelligent scientist – Professor Tadashi – run the illegal operation aiming to contribute to the city's destruction.
- Dooley and Kene's true intentions at the job are to make ends meet, but they cannot ignore the danger the toxic waste dump poses to the environment and people. Encountering other employees at the waste dump, they befriend Gloria, a go-getter and undercover reporter trying to expose Vittorio's criminal activities.
- Together with Gloria, the three amateur sleuths scheme to bring down the illegal toxic waste dump, expose the dark truth behind the operation, and save their city from further devastation.
- As they begin their clumsy undercover investigation, they stumble upon Professor Tadashi's secret project, which is a dangerous, experimental, and powerful formula called "Waste-X." This formula has the capability to amplify the hazardous effects of toxic waste, potentially destroying the environment for generations to come.

Act 3: 

- With the knowledge of "Waste-X," Dooley, Kene, and Gloria know it's now or never. They devise a daring plan to infiltrate Vittorio's office, steal the formula, and bring the mobster's operations to a halt.
- In an action-packed yet comedic climax, our heroes are confronted by Vittorio, Professor Tadashi, and their henchmen during the heist. A battle ensues, and just when things look bleak, other disgruntled employees and local residents come to their aid.
- The united front eventually triumphs, and the toxic waste dump is shut down. As a result, the city begins the long process of recovery and rehabilitation.
- In the end, Dooley and Kene, now aware of how their actions impacted the environment, open a waste recycling company with the help of Gloria who uses her journalism skills to promote awareness about the need for responsible waste disposal and eco-friendly living.
- The once broken city is now recovering with new life and hope, thanks to the brave efforts of Dooley, Kene, and their newfound friends. And although they never thought they'd end up making a difference, they've shown that with a little courage, humor, and determination, anything is possible.

"Toxically Hired" is a heartwarming action-comedy that reminds us that life might sometimes lead us to unexpected and dangerous paths, but it's through those challenges, the most essential lessons are learned, and the tightest bonds are formed.
