No, these two questions are not asking the same thing, but they are related as they both pertain to interacting with or dating other individuals. I will address each question in detail below.

First question: "At what age should a man be concerned about being a 'creepy old man', rather than just a guy whoâ€™s dating?"

There isn't a specific age at which a man should be concerned about being perceived as a "creepy old man." Age is just a number, and it is the way people behave and treat others that determines how they are perceived by others. In general, "creepy" behavior is characterized by being overly intrusive, making others feel uncomfortable, or pursuing individuals in an inappropriate manner.

To avoid being perceived as a "creepy old man" regardless of age, it is important to follow some general guidelines:

1. Be respectful of boundaries: This includes understanding and respecting both physical and emotional boundaries of the person you are trying to establish a relationship with.

2. Act your age: It is essential to embrace life experiences and maturity while interacting with people. Trying to act much younger than your actual age can come across as disingenuous and may make others feel uncomfortable.

3. Be genuine: Do not use manipulative tactics or play games while trying to establish a connection with someone. People appreciate authenticity and honesty.

4. Be aware of the age difference: When dating someone considerably younger, take into consideration the potential difference in life stages and what that might mean for the relationship to be mutually beneficial and respectful.

Second question: "What do you talk to women about in bars?"

When it comes to talking to women in bars, the most effective approach is to initiate a conversation that feels natural and relaxed. Here are some suggestions for topics to engage in:

1. Small talk: Start with small talk, such as discussing the location, music, or drinks. This helps break the ice and sets a friendly tone for the conversation.

2. Hobbies and interests: Ask about her interests and hobbies, and share some of yours. This helps to assess common grounds and could potentially serve as a foundation to connect on a deeper level.

3. Compliments: Genuine compliments are often appreciated, but be sure to avoid making any comments that could be perceived as offensive or superficial.

4. Current events or pop culture: Discussing recent events or popular culture topics can help demonstrate that you're a well-informed individual and can provide material for a lighthearted conversation.

5. Personal experiences: Share stories or interesting personal experiences, as they can provide a glimpse into your character and help spark a more intimate connection.

It is important to remember that every person is different, and some individuals may not be open to engaging in conversation at a bar. Always pay close attention to body language and verbal cues, and respect personal boundaries. If someone seems uninterested in talking, it is essential to recognize that signal and not push the issue further.

In conclusion, both questions touch upon the interaction and dating aspect, but they are fundamentally different questions. The first focuses on how to avoid being labeled as a "creepy old man," while the second question deals with initiating and maintaining conversation with women in social settings such as bars. By reviewing and implementing these guidelines, one can improve their social skills and understanding of how to interact respectfully with others.
