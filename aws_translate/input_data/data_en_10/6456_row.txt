Thousands of demonstrators blocked roads and pavements outside the Chinese embassy in London last night as support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests spread around the world. Organisers said 3,000 people in London wanted to show citizens of the former colony ‘they are not alone’, as they fixed more demonstrations yesterday in 25 more cities including New York, Manchester, Newcastle, Glasgow, Paris, Toronto, Seoul, Taipei, Sydney and Melbourne. In the streets of central London and New York's bustling Times Square alike the protesters held yellow umbrellas, which have become the symbol of pro-decmocracy campaigners who used them to take cover first from sun and rain, then from tear gas.
