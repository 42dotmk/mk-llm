TWIN FALLS • It often takes a lot of work to catch a burglar, but sometimes criminals make it easy for investigators. 
  
 A Twin Falls burglary suspect returned to the scene of the crime Saturday looking for keys and a cellphone he dropped during the heist, police say. 
  
 Caleb Shay Funke, 22, was arraigned Monday in Twin Falls County Magistrate Court on two charges of burglaries and one charge of grand-theft. 
  
 A woman called police about 2:30 p.m. saying she’d arrived home on the 200 block of Sixth Avenue North to find her back door open and her house ransacked, police said. Cupboards were open, books and paper were scattered, a file-cabinet was pried open and an unfamiliar cellphone was left on the bed. 
  
 A silver 2007 Chevrolet Cobalt was parked behind the house, where police said they could see cash and jewelry on the passenger seat. 
  
 While officers were still at the house investigating, a woman drove up behind the car and dropped Funke off, police said. 
  
 Funke told officers he let a friend borrow the car and the keys ended up locked inside, court documents said. He said he had arranged for a locksmith to come unlock the car. As Funke spoke with police, a resident of the burglarized house came out with some keys, saying they didn’t belong to anyone in the house, court documents said. 
  
 An officer unlocked and started the car with the keys. Funke said he wasn’t the burglar but knew who was. 
  
 His story didn’t add up, so police arrested him. When officers patted him down they found a piece of jewelry in his pocket belonging to the homeowner. Her cellphone was in his car, police said. 
  
 Police say Funke is also a suspect in two other Saturday burglaries. 
  
 A house on the 500 block of Washington Street North had a window broken out and was left in disarray, court documents said. Footprints found near both the garage and the backdoor matched the slippers Funke was wearing when he was arrested, police said. 
  
 Another house was burglarized in the 1000 block of Wirsching Avenue West, police said. 
  
 The homeowner’s daughter said she noticed bags of change missing and police found checks and a credit card from the home inside the Cobalt, court documents said. 
  
 In an interview with police, Funke admitted to being involved with all three burglaries, court documents said. He said he burglarized the house on Wirsching Avenue and was a lookout for a friend for the Sixth Avenue burglary. 
  
 Funke said he accidentally broke the window on Washington Street and was only there because he thought his friends lived there, police said. After climbing into the house he figured his friends must have moved and left without taking anything, court documents said. 
  
 Funke’s bond was set at $5,000 and a preliminary hearing is scheduled for Sept. 25. ||||| Hello, Im Craig Nabat, President of Ambitious Ideas, Inc., and inventor of FINDIT® -- the most innovative and easy-to-use locating device that attaches via adhesive strip or key ring to any of your commonly lost household items such as car keys, cellular phones, remote controls, electronic organizers, eyeglass cases, purses, and anything you tend to misplace.
