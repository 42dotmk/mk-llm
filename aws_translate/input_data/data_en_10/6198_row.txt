[Question]A craft store makes a third of its sales in the fabric section, a quarter of its sales in the jewelry section, and the rest in the stationery section. They made 36 sales today. How many sales were in the stationery section?
[Answer]The craft store made 36 / 3 = 12 sales in the fabric section. It made 36 / 4 = 9 sales in the jewelry section. Thus, there were 36 - 12 - 9 = 15 sales in the stationery section. The answer is 15.
Q: At football tryouts, the coach wanted to see who could throw the ball the farthest. Parker threw the ball 16 yards. Grant threw the ball 25 percent farther than Parker and Kyle threw the ball 2 times farther than Grant. Compared to Parker, how much farther did Kyle throw the ball?
A: Grant threw the ball 25% farther than Parker. If Parker threw the ball 16 yards, then Grant threw it 16 * .25 = 4 farther. In total, Grant threw the ball 16 + 4 = 20 yards. Kyle threw 2 times farther than Grant so Kyle threw the ball 2 * 20 = 40 yards. If Kyle threw the ball for 40 yards and Parker threw for 16 then Kyle threw the ball 40 - 16 = 24 yards farther. The answer is 24.
Question: A club opens up and charges $20 to enter. James buys 2 rounds for his 5 friends. He also buys 6 drinks for himself. Drinks cost $6 each. He decides to eat some food so he orders some fried chicken which costs $14. He leaves a 30% tip on everything he orders. How much did he spend for the night?
Answer: He buys 2 * 5 = 10 drinks for his friends. So he orders 10 + 6 = 16 total drinks. The cost of the drinks was 16 * 6 = $96. So his order came out to 96 + 14 = $110. The tip came out to 110 * .3 = $33. So his order cost 110 + 33 = $143. Adding in the cover charge means it cost 143 + 20 = $163. The answer is 163.
[Question]A lot of people have been sick at Gary's workplace, so he's been working a lot of extra shifts to fill in for people. As a result, he's earned some overtime (where every hour after 40 he earns 1.5 times his normal wage.) His paycheck (before taxes are taken out) came out to $696. If Gary normally earns $12 per hour, how many hours did he work that week?
[Answer]Gary earned overtime, so he worked at least 40 hours. for which he was paid 40 hours * $12 / hour = $480 at his normal wage. This means that $696 - $480 = $216 was earned at his overtime wage. His overtime wage is 1.5 his normal wage, or $12 * 1.5 = $18 per hour. So Gary worked $216 / $18 per hour = 12 hours' worth of overtime. So in total, Gary worked 40 hours + 12 hours = 52 hours that week. The answer is 52.
Q: A school has 15 classrooms. One-third of these classrooms have 30 desks in each classroom and the rest have 25 desks in each classroom. Only one student can sit at one desk. How many students can this school accommodate so that everyone has their own desk?
A: One - third of the classrooms have 30 desks, so there are 1 / 3 * 15 = 5 classrooms like that. The rest, which means 15 - 5 = 10 classrooms, have 25 desks. One - third of the classrooms can fit 5 * 30 = 150 students. The rest can fit 10 * 25 = 250 students. So in total, the school can be filled with 150 + 250 = 400 students. The answer is 400.
