Question: Rodney and Todd are rowing down a river that is 50 yards wide at one end. If the river's width increases from this end uniformly by 2 yards every 10 meters along, and they row along the river at a rate of 5 m/s, how long (in seconds) will it take them to get to the point where the river is 80 yards wide?
Answer: The difference in width between where they're starting from and their destination is 80 - 50 = 30 yards. The width increases 2 yards every 10 m along the river so they would have to cover (30 / 2) * 10 = 150 meters. Traveling at the rate of 5m / s, he will spend 150 / 5 = 30 seconds. The answer is 30.
[Question]Andy had a platter of chocolate cookies. He ate 3 of them then gave his little brother 5 because he was behaving. He then handed the platter to his basketball team of eight members. The first player to arrive took 1, the second player to arrive took 3, the third player took 5, and so on. When the last player took his share, the platter was empty. How many chocolate cookies did Andy have from start with?
[Answer]Andy and his brother ate 5 + 3 = 8 cookies in total. The nth term of the sequence for the basketball players taking cookies in 2n - 1. The number of players is 8 so they would have eaten 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 64 cookies. In total Andy had 64 + 8 = 72 cookies to start with before they were all eaten. The answer is 72.
Q: An online website offers a flat rate shipping price of $5.00 if the purchase is below $50.00. If it's above $50.00 then they will charge 20% of the purchase price for shipping. Thomas orders 3 shirts for $12.00 each, a pack of socks for $5.00, 2 pairs of shorts for $15.00 each and a pair of swim trunks for $14.00 How much will his total bill be, including shipping?
A: He orders 3 shirts at $12.00 each for a total of 3 * 12 = $36.00. He orders 2 pair of shorts for $15.00 each for a total of 2 * 15 = $30.00. He spends $36.00 on shirts, $5.00 on socks, $30.00 on shorts and $14.00 on a pair of swim trunks for a total of 36 + 5 + 30 + 14 = $85.00. His order is over $50.00 so he will be charged 20% shipping on his $85.00 order so he'll pay .20 * 85 = $17.00 in shipping. His order is $85.00 and he's paying $17.00 in shipping for a total bill of 85 + 17 = $102.00. The answer is 102.
Question: At Theoâ€™s cafe, he makes 3 egg and 4 egg omelettes. His cafe is open from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. In the first hour, 5 customers order the 3 egg omelettes. In the second hour, 7 customers order the 4 egg omelettes. In the third hour, 3 customers order the 3 egg omelettes. In the last hour, 8 customers order the 4 egg omelettes. How many eggs does Theo need to make all the omelettes?
Answer: In the first and third hour, 5 + 3 = 8 customers order the 3 egg omelettes. In the second and last hour, 7 + 8 = 15 customers order the 4 egg omelettes. To make the 3 egg omelettes, Theo needs 3 x 8 = 24 eggs. To make the 4 egg omelettes, Theo needs 15 x 4 = 60 eggs. To make all the omelettes, he needs 24 + 60 = 84 eggs. The answer is 84.
