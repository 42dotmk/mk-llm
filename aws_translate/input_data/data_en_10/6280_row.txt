Islamic State militants are luring innocent American teenage girls into their violent and war-hungry terror network with 'Disney-like versions' of life under extremism, a terror expert has warned. The claims were made as three American schoolgirls were arrested in Germany as they apparently travelled to Syria to join Islamic militants. The girls — two sisters ages 17 and 15, and a 16-year-old friend, from Denver, Colorado — were stopped in Frankfurt by F.B.I. agents trying to board a plane last weekend after stealing $2,000 from their parents and running away. They were arrested and sent home to their families in the Aurora suburb of the city.
