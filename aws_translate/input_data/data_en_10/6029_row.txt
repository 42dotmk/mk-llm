The most logical next event after becoming familiar with the girl and getting her to notice you would be engaging her in conversation. This will help build a deeper connection and provide opportunities for you both to learn more about each other's likes, dislikes, and interests. Here is a step-by-step approach to engaging a girl in conversation after making yourself familiar to her:

1. Find the right time and place: Look for an appropriate time and setting to initiate conversation. Ideally, choose a moment when she seems receptive and relaxed, such as during a break between classes, during lunch, or after school. Avoid approaching her when she is busy, stressed, or with a large group of friends, as this may make her feel uncomfortable or pressured.

2. Approach her confidently: Confidence is attractive, so maintain good posture, make eye contact, and smile as you approach her. This will signal to her that you are friendly and genuinely interested in getting to know her.

3. Use open-ended questions: The key to engaging someone in conversation is to ask open-ended questions that cannot be answered with just a 'yes' or 'no.' This encourages the person to share more information and keeps the conversation flowing. For example, instead of asking "Do you like this class?", try asking "What do you think about this class?" or "How do you feel about the subject?"

4. Listen actively: When she speaks, pay close attention to what she is saying and respond thoughtfully to show that you are genuinely interested in her thoughts and feelings. Listening actively not only demonstrates respect but also helps you gather information that can be used to further the conversation and ask more in-depth questions.

5. Share information about yourself: Opening up about yourself is essential to building a connection. Share some personal stories or anecdotes that relate to the conversation, but be careful not to dominate the discussion.

6. Find common ground: Discovering shared interests, values, or experiences can help create a bond and provide more topics for conversation. If you come across a common interest during the conversation, delve deeper into that subject to keep the conversation engaging and interesting.

7. Be respectful and considerate: Treat her with kindness and respect throughout the conversation. Avoid interrupting and making inappropriate comments or jokes. Additionally, be attentive to her body language and verbal cues, as these can indicate whether she is enjoying the conversation or feeling uncomfortable.

8. Know when to end the conversation: A good conversation should leave both parties wanting more. Therefore, it's essential to recognize when a conversation has run its course or if she seems to be in a hurry or disinterested. When it's time to end the conversation, do so gracefully by thanking her for her time and expressing interest in continuing the conversation in the future.

9. Follow up: If the conversation went well, consider following up with her at a later time to show that you are still interested in getting to know her better. This could be via a text, a message on social media, or another in-person conversation.

By taking this approach to engage a girl in conversation after becoming familiar with her and getting her to notice you, you will be well on your way to developing a strong connection and potentially forming a meaningful relationship. Remember to be yourself, and let the conversation flow naturally, as authenticity and honesty are the cornerstones of any successful relationship.
