Article: In order for the "torrc" file—the file which determines Tor's exit node preferences—to appear, you must run Tor on your computer at least once. You can run Tor by clicking the Tor app icon and then clicking Connect. It's a menu item at the top of the screen. Clicking it prompts a drop-down menu. If you don't see this menu item, first click the desktop or open {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/1\/1d\/Macfinder2.png","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/1\/1d\/Macfinder2.png\/32px-Macfinder2.png","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":431,"bigWidth":"32","bigHeight":"30","licensing":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>I edited this screenshot of a macOS icon.\n<\/p><p>License: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fair_use\">Fair Use<\/a><br>\n<\/p><\/div>"} Finder. This option is at the bottom of the drop-down menu. Doing so will open a text box in the middle of the screen. Type in ~/Library/Application Support/TorBrowser-Data/Tor/ and press ⏎ Return. Doing so will take you to the location where the "torrc" file is stored. Double-click the "torrc" file, then select TextEdit when prompted to choose a program. This will allow you to edit the "torrc" file's text. Place your cursor below the last line of text in the document, then type in EntryNodes {} StrictNodes 1 and press ⏎ Return. Type in ExitNodes {} StrictNodes 1 and press ⏎ Return. Go to https://web.archive.org/web/20180328074444/http://www.b3rn3d.com/blog/2014/03/05/tor-country-codes/ in your computer's web browser, scroll down to the "List of country codes for Tor" heading, and look for the codes for the countries that you want to use as your entry and exit nodes. For example, if you want your Tor browsing session to start in Canada and exit in Uganda, you would look for the "Canada" country code (ca) and the "Uganda" country code (ug). Type the code for the country in which you want your session to start in between the {} brackets to the right of the "EntryNodes" line, then repeat with the exit country and the "ExitNodes" line. For example, to enter in Canada and exit in Uganda, your lines might look like this:  EntryNodes {ca} StrictNodes1 ExitNodes {ug} StrictNodes1 You can do this by replacing StrictNodes 1 with StrictNodes 0 which will ensure that Tor can still use other countries' codes if your specified ones aren't working. If you do want to keep strict nodes enabled for your entry and/or exit nodes, consider adding multiple countries rather than just using one country. You can add countries by adding more country codes inside of brackets, making sure to separate them with spaces. For example, to add the United States and France to the "ExitNodes" Uganda line, you would have the following line:  ExitNodes {ug},{us},{fr} StrictNodes 1 Make sure there are no spaces between bracketed countries. Press ⌘ Command+S, then exit TextEdit. This should replace the "torrc" file's original text with your updated text. Tor may take an extra few seconds to start this time, especially if you selected a distant country. Go to any website (e.g., https://www.google.com/) in Tor, then click the onion-shaped icon in the upper-left side of the page. A drop-down menu with a "Tor circuit for this site" heading will appear with your browser, entry node, middle connections, exit node, and the Internet listed from top to bottom. For this method's example, you would see the following: This browser > Canada [IP address] > [Country] [IP address] > Uganda [IP address] > Internet
