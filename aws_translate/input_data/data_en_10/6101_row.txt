Reasoning and answer: The garden is 220 * 120 = 26,400 square feet. The tilled land will take up half the area, and the trellises and raised beds will be the other half. Each half is 26,400 / 2 = 13,200 square feet. The trellises will take up 1 / 3 of the remaining land, so the raised beds will take 1 - 1 / 3 = 2 / 3 of the remaining land. So the total area of the raised bed area will be 13,200 square feet * (2 / 3) = 8,800 square feet.
The answer: 8800

Every week Carl needs to drive additional 6 hours, so in two weeks that would make 2 * 6 = 12 additional hours. Two weeks of driving 2 hours every day, means 14 * 2 = 28 hours of driving. So during two weeks, Carl will drive 28 + 12 = 40 hours.
The answer: 40

Reasoning and answer: Omar drinks 1 / 4 * 12 = 12 / 4 = 3 ounces on the way to work. Omar drinks 1 / 2 * 12 = 12 / 2 = 6 ounces when he gets to his office. When he drinks 1 ounce more, he will have drunk 3 + 6 + 1 = 10 ounces. Thus, there will be 12 - 10 = 2 ounces left in the cup afterward.
The answer: 2

For each type of shirt, he needed to buy, 40 employees / 4 = 10 shirts. White men's T - shirts cost $20 / shirt * 10 shirts = $200. White women's T - shirts cost $5 less, or ($20 / shirt - $5 / shirt) * 10 shirts = $15 / shirt * 10 shirts = $150. Black men's t - shirts cost, $18 / shirt * 10 shirts = $180. Black women's T - shirts cost $ 5 less, so ($18 / shirt - $5 / shirt) * 10 shirts = $13 / shirt * 10 shirts = $130. Now add up all these quantities to find the total: $200 + $150 + $180 + $130 = $660.
The answer: 660
