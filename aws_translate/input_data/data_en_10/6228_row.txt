Q: A farmer owns a hog that recently gave birth to 6 piglets. If the farmer raises the piglets until they are fully grown, he can sell the fully grown pig for $300. Each piglet must grow for at least 12 months before it is large enough to be sold. It costs the farmer $10 per month to feed each animal until it is sold. If the farmer sells 3 pigs after 12 months, and the remaining 3 pigs after 16 months, how much profit did he earn in total (after deducting the cost of food)?
A: The 3 pigs that are sold after 12 months will cost the farmer 12 * 10 * 3 = $360 in food costs. The 3 pigs that are sold after 16 months will cost the farmer 16 * 10 * 3 = $480 in food costs. Thus, the total food cost to raise the 6 piglets was 360 + 480 = $840. Next, selling the 6 fully grown pigs will earn the farmer 6 * 300 = $1800 in revenue. Therefore, the earn the farmer 1800 - 840 = $960 in profit from these sales. The answer is 960.
Question: Carter has a 14-hour road trip. He wants to stop every 2 hours to stretch his legs. He also wants to make 2 additional stops for food and 3 additional stops for gas. If each pit stop takes 20 minutes, how many hours will his road trip become?
Answer: He has a 14 - hour trip and wants to stop every 2 hours so that's 14 / 2 = 7 pit stops. He will make 7 pit stops plus 2 more for food and 3 more for gas for a total of 7 + 2 + 3 = 12 pit stops. Each pit stop will take 20 minutes and he is making 12 stops so that's 20 * 12 = 240 minutes. 60 minutes are in an hour and he's adding 240 minutes to his trip so that's 240 / 60 = 4 more hours. His trip started as 14 hours and he will add an additional 4 hours in pit stops for a total of a 14 + 4 = 18 hour long trip. The answer is 18.
[Question]Max attended 40 college courses in 2 years. Sid attended four times as many college courses as Max in the same period. What's the total of college courses they both attended?

Q: A farmer is selling ducks and chickens at the market. He sells ducks for $10 and chickens for $8. He sells 5 chickens and some ducks. He then spends half his earnings on a new wheelbarrow. After buying it, someone sees it and agrees to pay the farmer double what the farmer paid and the farmer earns another $60. How many ducks did the farmer sell?
A: The wheelbarrow cost $30 because 60 / 2 = 30. The farmer earned $60 from selling fowl because 30 / (1 / 2) = 60. The farmer earned $40 selling chickens because 5 x 8 = 40. The farmer earned $20 selling ducks because 60 - 40 = 20. The farmer sold 2 ducks because 20 / 10 = 2. The answer is 2.
Question: The Franzia wine is three times as old as the Carlo Rosi, while the Carlo Rosi is four times older than the Twin Valley. Calculate the total age of the three brands of wine if the Carlo Rosi is 40 years old.
Answer: If the Franzia wine brand is three times as old as the Carlo Rosi, then the Carlo Rosi is 3 * 40 = 120 years old. The total number of years the Carlo Rosi and the Franzia wine brands have been around is 120 + 40 = 160 years. The Carlo Rosi is four times older than the Twin Valley wine brand, meaning the Twin valley wine brand is 40 / 4 = 10 years old. Together, the three bands have a total of 10 + 160 = 170 years of existence. The answer is 170.
