a). Justin is a beginner.

Justin has always loved eating pancakes but never actually tried making them from scratch. He had heard that his friend Robert make delicious pancakes, so he decided to ask him for some advice. Since Justin is a beginner at cooking, he thought Robert could give him some helpful tips.

On a sunny Saturday morning, Justin called Robert and invited him to his place. "Hey Robert, could you come over and teach me how to flip a pancake? I really want to learn, and I heard that you are an expert at making them!" Robert laughed at the 'expert' title but agreed to help his friend out.

When Robert arrived, he found Justin in the kitchen, apron on and ingredients neatly laid out on the counter. He was eager to learn, yet a little apprehensive about making something that required a particular skill such as flipping. Robert reassured him that it's not as hard as it looks, and they began working through the process step by step.

First, they mixed the dry ingredients such as flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt in a large bowl. In another bowl, they combined the wet ingredients which included milk, eggs, and melted butter. Robert advised Justin that it's best to make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients and then gradually add the wet ingredients while whisking. This would ensure a smooth, lump-free batter.

Once they achieved the right consistency, Robert showed Justin how to heat the non-stick pan properly. "Remember, a well-heated pan is essential for making perfectly flipped pancakes. If it's too cold, the batter will stick, making it difficult to flip," he explained.

As the pan reached the desired temperature, Robert showed Justin how to ladle the batter into the pan. He advised pouring the batter from a small height and letting it spread out evenly on its own. "Don't overcrowd the pan," Robert warned. "Give the pancake space to grow."

Justin was growing more confident as he watched the pancake cooking on the first side. The edges were starting to firm up, and small bubbles were forming on the surface. "It's time for the flip!" exclaimed Robert with excitement. "Here's the part where your wrist comes into play."

Robert demonstrated the pancake flip to Justin. He loosened the edges of the pancake with a spatula and then, with a flick of his wrist, flipped the pancake in the air. The pancake made a graceful arc and landed perfectly back in the pan. Justin watched in awe, excited to try it for himself.

Taking a deep breath, Justin attempted his first flip. The pancake went airborne, but it didn't land quite as effortlessly as Robert's. However, it was still a decent attempt for a first-timer. Justin was thrilled with his progress and asked Robert to critique his technique so he could improve.

Over the next few pancakes, Justin practiced and began mastering the flip. Robert continued to provide support and pointers whenever needed. By the time they finished making the pancakes, Justin was flipping them with ease, his confidence soaring.

The friends enjoyed the fruits of their labor, devouring stacks of delicious homemade pancakes topped with melted butter and maple syrup. They laughed and talked about their fun-filled morning, and Justin expressed his gratitude to Robert for teaching him a new skill. "Thanks, Robert! I couldn't have done it without you!"

From that day on, Justin continued to hone his pancake-flipping skills and even dabble in variations like blueberry and chocolate chip pancakes. He was no longer a beginner but a pancake enthusiast, all thanks to his friend Robert's guidance and patience.
