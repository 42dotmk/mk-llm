While both questions address the connection between the number 666 and Satanism, their phrasings suggest slightly different focuses. Let's examine each question to better understand their nuances and provide a more comprehensive response to both inquiries.

1. How is 666 Satanic?
This question seems to ask for an explanation of the ways or mechanisms through which 666 is associated with Satanism. In other words, the focus is on the origin or nature of this association. 

2. Why is the number 666 considered Satanic?
This question also asks about the connection between 666 and Satanism, but with an emphasis on the reasons behind this consideration. This question seeks to understand why people view the number as Satanic.

Now let's provide a detailed and long answer to cover both questions:

The association between the number 666 and Satanism can be traced back to the New Testament of the Christian Bible, specifically to the Book of Revelation. The Book of Revelation is a prophetic and apocalyptic text, and one of its most well-known passages is Revelation 13:18, which states: "Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six." In this context, the "beast" is often interpreted as an evil figure, usually identified with Satan, the Antichrist, or a representative of a corrupt and demonic power.

Throughout the years, various interpretations have attempted to uncover the meaning of 666. One popular theory is that the number refers to the Roman Emperor Nero. Nero was notorious for his tyranny and persecution of Christians, and he has been regarded by some as a prototype of the Antichrist. When his name is transliterated into Hebrew and calculated using gematria, a form of numerology in which letters have corresponding numeric values, Nero's name equates to 666. However, this interpretation is just one of many, and definitive identification remains uncertain.

In more recent times, the number 666 has taken on a general symbolic significance in popular culture. It represents evil, malevolence, or rebellion against divine authority. This symbolic association has been reinforced in literature, cinema, and other cultural expressions where the number is used to evoke an ominous or unsettling atmosphere. As a consequence, 666 has become widely associated with Satanism, which is a religious, philosophical, or political movement that deals with the symbolism of Satan, either by venerating the figure or adopting its rebellious stance.

Despite its longstanding and complex relationship with Satanism, it is important to note that the number 666, in and of itself, is just a number. It has no intrinsic malevolent or sinister properties. The perceived connection to evil is rooted in religious and cultural interpretations that have evolved over centuries. To devout believers in Christianity, the number 666 may represent warnings and prophetic revelations, whereas, for staunch skeptics or adherents to other religious beliefs, the number may hold little to no significance in their spiritual lives.

In summary, both questions address the connection between 666 and Satanism, with slight differences in focus. The number 666 is considered Satanic largely due to its biblical reference in the Book of Revelation and its symbolic history as a signpost of evil. Its interpretation has varied over time, ranging from a specific association with figures like Emperor Nero to a more general cultural symbol of malevolence or rebellion.
