To accomplish the goal of forming an "away team" (a team that works remotely or goes offsite to perform specific tasks), one should follow these step-by-step guidelines:

1. Define the purpose and objectives of the away team: Before assembling the away team, it's important to have a clear understanding of the team's purpose, goals, and objectives. This will help in selecting the appropriate team members and planning their tasks accordingly.

Justification: Knowing the purpose and objectives will help ensure the away team is focused and effective in achieving the desired goals.

2. Determine the required roles and responsibilities: Based on the purpose and objectives, identify the roles and responsibilities that will be needed within the away team. This can include project managers, subject matter experts, technicians, and others.

Justification: Identifying the roles and responsibilities will help in selecting the right team members and making sure each task within the team is covered.

3. Select the team members: Choose team members based on their skill sets, expertise, and experience relevant to the roles and responsibilities identified. Consider including individuals with different backgrounds and perspectives for enhanced collaboration and problem-solving.

Justification: Having a diverse mix of team members with relevant skills and expertise will enable the away team to effectively tackle the tasks at hand.

4. Establish communication protocols and channels: Ensure that the away team has a clear and effective method for communicating with each other and with stakeholders back at the main location. This can include setting up regular team meetings and using collaboration tools like video calls, chat apps, and project management platforms.

Justification: Effective communication is crucial for the success of any team, especially for an away team, which may have limited face-to-face interaction.

5. Provide necessary resources and training: Equip the away team with the necessary tools, resources, and training needed to perform their tasks effectively and efficiently. This may include access to technical equipment, software, or other specialized resources.

Justification: Providing the required resources and training will help ensure that the away team can complete their tasks successfully.

6. Set clear expectations and milestones: Establish clear expectations for the away team and set achievable milestones for them to reach throughout the project or assignment. This will help keep the team on track and measure their progress.

Justification: Setting expectations and milestones will help maintain focus, motivation, and accountability within the away team.

7. Monitor progress and provide support: Regularly check in on the away team's progress and offer guidance, support, and assistance when needed. Be prepared to troubleshoot any issues that may arise and make adjustments to the team's strategy as necessary.

Justification: Monitoring progress and providing support ensures that the away team stays on track and has access to the resources and assistance needed to achieve their goals.

8. Evaluate results and implement improvements: Once the away team's goals have been met, review their performance, and identify areas for improvement. Utilize feedback from the team members and stakeholders to make necessary adjustments and refine the away team process for future projects.

Justification: Continuous evaluation and improvement will help the away team become increasingly efficient and effective, contributing to overall organizational success.
