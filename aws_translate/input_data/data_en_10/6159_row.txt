Information:  - GNU Emacs is the most popular and most ported Emacs text editor. It was created by GNU Project founder Richard Stallman. In common with other varieties of Emacs, GNU Emacs is extensible using a Turing complete programming language. GNU Emacs has been called "the most powerful text editor available today." With proper support from the underlying system, GNU Emacs is able to display files in multiple character sets, and has been able to simultaneously display most human languages since at least 1999. Throughout its history, GNU Emacs has been a central component of the GNU project, and a flagship of the free software movement. GNU Emacs is sometimes abbreviated as GNUMACS, especially to differentiate it from other EMACS variants. The tag line for GNU Emacs is "the extensible self-documenting text editor".  - Richard Matthew Stallman (born March 16, 1953), often known by his initials, rms, is an American software freedom activist and programmer. He campaigns for software to be distributed in a manner such that its users receive the freedoms to use, study, distribute and modify that software. Software that ensures these freedoms is termed free software. Stallman launched the GNU Project, founded the Free Software Foundation, developed the GNU Compiler Collection and GNU Emacs, and wrote the GNU General Public License.  - Free software, freedom-respecting software, or software libre is computer software distributed under terms that allow the software users to run the software for any purpose as well as to study, change, and distribute the software and any adapted versions. Free software is a matter of liberty, not price: users, individually or collectively, are free to do what they want with it, including the freedom to redistribute the software free of charge, or to sell it, or charge for related services such as support or warranty for profit.  - Gnus / nuz / , or Gnus Network User Services , is a message reader which is part of GNU Emacs . ( It also works in XEmacs . ) It supports reading and composing both e-mail and news and can also act as an RSS reader , web processor , and directory browser for both local and remote filesystems . Gnus blurs the distinction between news and e-mail , treating them both as `` articles '' that come from different sources . News articles are kept separate by group , and e-mail can be split into arbitrary groups , similar to folders in other mail readers . In addition , Gnus is able to use a number of web - based sources as inputs for its groups . Note that , as with GNU , the g in Gnus is always pronounced .  - The GNU Project is a free software, mass collaboration project, announced on September 27, 1983, by Richard Stallman at MIT. Its aim is to give computer users freedom and control in their use of their computers and computing devices, by collaboratively developing and providing software that is based on the following freedom rights: users are free to run the software, share it (copy, distribute), study it and modify it. GNU software guarantees these freedom-rights legally (via its license), and is therefore free software; the use of the word "free" always being taken to refer to freedom.  - GNU is an operating system and an extensive collection of computer software. GNU is composed wholly of free software, most of which is licensed under the GNU Project's own GPL.
