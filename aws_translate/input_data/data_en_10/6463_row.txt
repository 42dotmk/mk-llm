If he uses 6 cups of flour, the baker will be making 6 / 2 = 3 times the normal amount that the recipe describes. Thus, he must use 3 * 3 = 9 eggs.
The answer: 9
Reverse engineering the question: A baker is making bread according to a recipe that requires him to use 3 eggs for every 2 cups of flour. If the baker wants to use up the 6 cups of flour he has remaining in his pantry, how many eggs will he need to use?

Reasoning and answer: On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles. On Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas. On Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas. On Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors. Over the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 24 hours spent dog - walking. This means she still has 32 maximum hours – 24 used hours = 8 hours available for dog - walking. Therefore, she can walk 8 hours / 2 hours per poodle = 4 poodles on Tuesday.
The answer: 4

Question: Charlotte is a dog walker and is creating a schedule for all of her clients this week. Each dog is walked separately. On Monday, she needs to walk 4 poodles and 2 Chihuahuas. On Tuesday, she walks the same amount of Chihuahuas but isn't sure how many poodles she should walk. On Wednesday, she walks 4 Labradors. It takes 2 hours to walk a poodle, 1 hour to walk a Chihuahua, and 3 hours to walk a Labrador. If she has time for a total of 32 hours spent in dog-walking this week, how many poodles can Charlotte walk on Tuesday?

He sold 10 + 12 + 9 = 31 bicycles. He bought 15 + 8 + 11 = 34 bicycles. He now has 34 - 31 = 3 more than at Friday's opening.
The answer: 3
Reverse engineering the question: On Friday, Hank opened his used-bicycle store with a stock of bicycles, all fixed-up and ready to ride. Over the course of the day, he sold 10 bicycles and bought an additional 15 to fix up. On Saturday, he sold 12 bicycles and bought 8 more. And on Sunday, he sold 9 bicycles and bought 11 more. What was the net increase in the number of bicycles in stock in Hank's store over the three days?

Reasoning and answer: In 2 minutes, 12 liters of water flow into the bathtub and 2 liters (2 minutes x 1 liter / minute ) escape. This will leave 12 – 2 = 10 liters of water every two minutes. We can divide the number of liters by the number of minutes to find the average flow per minute, which is 10 / 2 = 5 liters per minute. To fill the tub, it will take 120 liters / 5 liters / min = 24 min.
The answer: 24

Question: Robi Ney wants to fill a 120-liter tub. He is amused by letting the water run for 1 minute, then closing the water supply for 1 minute, and so on alternating opening and closing the water supply. But the cap at the bottom of the tub is not very airtight and lets 1 liter of water escape per minute. The flow rate of the tap is 12 liters per minute. How long does it take to fill the tub in minutes?

His sister is 10 * 2 = 20 years old. Their age difference is 20 - 10 = 10 years. Therefore when he is 50 she will be 50 + 10 = 60 years old.
The answer: 60
Reverse engineering the question: John is 10 years old. His sister is twice his age. When he is 50 years old, how old will his sister be?

Rory has 30 more jellybeans than Gigi who has 15 so Rory has 30 + 15 = 45 jellybeans. Rory has 45 jellybeans and Gigi has 15 so that's 45 + 15 = 60 jellybeans total. Lorelai has eaten three times the amount of jellybeans that both girls have so she has eaten 3 * 60 = 180 jellybeans.
The answer: 180
