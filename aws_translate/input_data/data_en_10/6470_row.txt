Ingredients

To make a tomato garlic sauce, you'll need the following ingredients:

- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- 4 cloves of garlic, minced or crushed
- 1 (28-ounce) can of crushed tomatoes 
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Optional: fresh basil, oregano, crushed red pepper flakes, Parmesan cheese

Instructions

1. Have all ingredients prepared and measured before starting. Mince or crush the garlic to increase its surface area and release the maximum amount of flavor. Set aside a 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes that have been strained, if preferred, to remove excess liquid and ensure a thicker sauce.

2. In a medium-sized saucepan, heat the two tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Use a high-quality olive oil since it adds richness and depth to the sauce. As the oil warms, swirl it around the saucepan to coat the surface evenly.

3. Add the minced or crushed garlic to the saucepan, saut√©ing it gently in the olive oil. It's crucial not to overcook the garlic as it becomes bitter when burnt. Stir the garlic continuously for approximately one to two minutes, or until it turns a fragrant golden brown.

4. Carefully pour the can of crushed tomatoes into the saucepan with the olive oil and garlic. The sudden addition of the liquid ingredients may cause the oil to sputter, so be cautious when combining.

5. Stir the tomatoes, olive oil, and garlic together, incorporating all the flavors into a uniform mixture. At this point, you may add optional ingredients such as fresh basil, oregano, or crushed red pepper flakes to tailor the sauce to your preferences. Continue to stir the sauce over medium heat for about 20 to 30 minutes, allowing the sauce to simmer and gradually thicken.

6. While the sauce simmers, periodically taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. The key to a well-balanced sauce is adjusting the seasoning to your liking, so don't be afraid to customize the flavor profile to suit your tastes. 

7. Remove the sauce from the heat once it reaches your desired consistency and thickness. If you desire an even smoother sauce, you can use an immersion blender or carefully transfer the sauce to a conventional blender (in batches, if necessary). Remember to let the sauce cool a bit before blending to avoid injury by hot splatters.

8. Your tomato garlic sauce is now ready to be used in a variety of dishes or stored for future use. Allow the sauce to cool to room temperature before transferring it to an airtight container. The sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one week or frozen for several months.
