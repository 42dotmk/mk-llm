If Robi contributed $4000, then Rudy contributed 1 / 4 * 4000 = $1000 more. The total amount of money Rudy contributed is $4000 + $1000 = $5000. Together, the contributed a total of $5000 + $4000 = $9000. They made a 20% profit, a total of 20 / 100 * $9000 = $1800. When they decided to share the profit equally, each received $1800 / 2 = $900.
The answer: 900
Reverse engineering the question: Robi and Rudy contributed money to start a business that could earn them profit. Robi contributed $4000, and Rudy contributed 1/4 more money than Robi. If they made a profit of 20 percent of the total amount and decided to share the profits equally, calculate the amount of money each got.

Reasoning and answer: Let s be the number of gallons of seed Carson uses and f be the number of gallons of fertilizer. We know that s = 3f and s + f = 60. Substituting the first equation into the second equation produces 3f + f = 60. Combining like terms, we get 4f = 60. Dividing both sides by 4, we get f = 15. Substituting that value into the equation s = 3f, we get s = 3 * 15 = 45.
The answer: 45

Question: Carson is covering the high school football field with grass seed. Each square meter needs three times as much seed as fertilizer. If Carson uses 60 gallons of seed and fertilizer combined, how many gallons of seed does he use?

The students need eat 100 vegetables in total because 200 / 2 = 100. Each student needs to eat on average 4 vegetables because 100 / 25 = 4. Each student needs to eat 2 vegetables per school week because 4 / 2 = 2.
The answer: 2
Reverse engineering the question: To try to get the class to eat more vegetables, the teacher says that she will start giving them good character points that the class can redeem for a movie day if they earn enough. The students need to earn 200 points to win the movie day. Each time a student eats their vegetables at lunch she gives the student 2 points. There are 25 students in the class. If they have two school weeks, otherwise known as 10 days to win the movie, what is the average number of vegetables each student must eat per school week to get a movie day?

Reasoning and answer: The plane trip is four times longer than the 2 - hour long boat trip, which means it takes 4 * 2 = 8 hours. So in total, the whole journey to "Virgo" islands lasts 8 + 2 = 10 hours.
The answer: 10
What was the question?
Question: To get to an island called "Virgo", Tom needs to travel by plane and then by boat. The plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, and the boat trip takes up to 2 hours. In how many hours is Tom able to get to the "Virgo" island?

He spent $50.00 and 80% of the meal went to entrees so he spent 50 * .80 = $40.00 on entrees. He spent $50.00 and $40.00 went to entrees so that leaves $50 - $40 = $10.00 for appetizers. Each appetizer costs the same amount and he spent $10.00 all together so each appetizer is $10 / 2 = $5.00.
The answer: 5
Reverse engineering the question: Tim spent $50.00 on Chinese take-out. 80% of the cost went to 4 entrees. The rest of the money went to 2 appetizers that each cost the same amount. How much was the price of a single appetizer?

Adam can make 15 x 3 = 45 figurines out of the blocks of basswood. He can also make 3 x 2 = 6 figurines out of a block of Aspen wood. So, he can make 20 x 6 = 120 figurines out of all the blocks of Aspen wood. He can also make 20 x 4 = 80 figurines out of all the blocks of butternut wood. Therefore, Adam can make a total of 120 + 80 + 45 = 245 figurines using all the blocks of wood.
The answer: 245
