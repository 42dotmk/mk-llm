The most logical next event after surrounding yourself with images of flight is to practice dream control and lucid dreaming. Lucid dreaming is the ability to become aware that you're dreaming while remaining asleep. When you are aware that you are dreaming, you can then control and manipulate aspects of your dream, such as flying. By taking the steps to learn and practice lucid dreaming, you can unlock the ability to fly in your dreams.

Here is a detailed guide on how to achieve lucid dreaming and flying in your dreams:

1. Dream Journaling: Keep a dream journal by your bedside and write down your dreams immediately upon waking up. This will help you remember your dreams and improve dream recall. Recording your dreams also strengthens the connection between your waking and dreaming states, making it easier to become lucid during a dream.

2. Reality Checks: Perform regular reality checks throughout the day to establish a consistent habit. Reality checks help you question your surroundings, making it more likely that you'll recognize the anomalies of a dream state while asleep. Common reality checks include pushing your fingers through your palm or reading text and looking away to see if it changes when you look back. 

3. Meditation and Mindfulness: Engaging in regular meditation can help improve your ability to become lucid in your dreams. Meditation practices such as focusing on your breath and observing your thoughts without judgment will enhance your self-awareness and strengthen your connection to your inner self. Practicing mindfulness throughout the day can also help to sharpen your awareness, making it more likely that you will notice when you are dreaming.

4. Sleep Hygiene: Having a proper sleep schedule can make it easier to become lucid in your dreams. Ensure that you are getting enough sleep each night and try to maintain a regular sleep schedule. A well-rested mind is more likely to become lucid during dreams and be able to control the events within them.

5. Wake Back to Bed (WBTB) Technique: The WBTB technique involves waking up after about five or six hours of sleep, staying awake for a short period (15-60 minutes), and then going back to sleep. By interrupting your sleep, you increase the chances of entering a REM sleep period, during which lucid dreams are most likely to occur.

6. Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams (MILD) Technique: Before going to sleep, repeat a mantra such as, "I will become aware that I'm dreaming" or "I will fly in my dreams tonight." This intention-setting practice helps to create a mental habit that increases the likelihood of becoming lucid during a dream.

7. Visualization: Once you achieve lucidity in a dream, visualize yourself flying. Start by imagining yourself hovering just a few inches above the ground. Gradually increase your height and speed as you gain confidence and control over your dream. You can visualize environments that inspire flight, such as vast open spaces, the sky, or clouds.

8. Experiment with Different Techniques: Understand that each individual is different, and various techniques may be more effective for some than others. Be open to experimentation, and adjust your approach based on your experiences and successes.

Remember that practice and patience are key when learning how to fly in your dreams. It may take some time to develop the necessary skills to achieve lucidity and cultivate dream control. Maintaining a persistent and consistent effort in practicing these techniques will eventually enable you to experience the exhilarating sensation of flight within your dreams.
