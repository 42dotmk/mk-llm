In order to provide proper analysis and evaluate the implications of this decision, the following steps would be taken:

Step 1: Research the new Greek government and their policies
To understand the background of the situation, it is essential to gather information on the new Greek government led by Alexis Tsipras. What are their beliefs, policies, and motivations behind decisions such as delaying the agreement on EU sanctions against Russia?

Step 2: Review the EU sanctions against Russia
Before analyzing the effects of the delayed agreement, it is necessary to have an understanding of the EU sanctions against Russia. This includes knowing what areas those sanctions target, such as finance, energy, or military; the reasons behind the imposition of sanctions; and the impact the sanctions have had on Russia and the EU so far.

Step 3: Analyze the potential impacts of delaying the agreement
This step involves evaluating the implications of delaying the agreement on further EU sanctions against Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine. Assessing how this decision could affect the dynamics among member countries within the EU and potential changes in their relationships with Russia, as well as the potential effect on the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine.

Step 4: Consider possible Russian actions and motives
It is important to analyze Russia's possible actions and motives behind the new Greek government's decision to delay the EU sanctions. Investigate whether Moscow sees the new Greek government as an opportunity to create division and confusion within the EU and NATO, as well as the implications should the claims of a 'Trojan horse' strategy hold weight.

Step 5: Explore reactions and responses from the EU, NATO, and other international stakeholders
In order to gauge the significance of the Greek government's decision, it's crucial to research the reactions and responses from the EU, NATO, and other international stakeholders. This will provide insight into the potential diplomatic and geopolitical outcomes, as well as any possible shifts in policy or strategy among the involved parties.

Step 6: Compare the situation with historical instances or similar scenarios
By comparing historical instances or similar scenarios, valuable insights and possible outcomes can be gained. This could include situations where other countries have been accused of acting as 'Trojan horses' within key western alliances or examining other instances of delayed sanctions and the following consequences.

Step 7: Propose potential responses
After completing a comprehensive analysis of the decision to delay the EU sanctions and the potential implications, propose potential responses that can be made by the EU, NATO, or other stakeholders. These responses can include diplomatic actions, funding, support, or policy changes that could mitigate negative impacts or strengthen cohesion within the EU and NATO.

Step 8: Conclusion and recommendations
Based on the analysis and steps taken, draw a conclusion summarizing the impact of the new Greek government's decision to delay the agreement on EU sanctions against Russia. Offer recommendations for how the EU, NATO, and other international stakeholders should proceed in light of the potential risks and opportunities presented by this decision.
