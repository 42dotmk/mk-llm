Q: For homework, Brooke has 15 math problems, 6 social studies problems, and 10 science problems. He can answer each math problem for 2 minutes while answering each social studies problem takes him 30 seconds. If he can answer each science problem in 1.5 minutes, how long will it take Brooke to answer all his homework?
A: Brooke will take 15 x 2 = 30 minutes to answer all math problems. It will take him 6 x 30 seconds = 180 seconds to answer all social studies problems. In minutes, this is equal to 180 / 60 = 3 minutes. It will take him 10 x 1.5 minutes = 15 minutes to answer all science problems. Therefore, Brooke will take 30 + 3 + 15 = 48 minutes to finish his homework. The answer is 48.
Question: Julie wants to give her favorite cousin a $2345 mountain bike for his birthday. So far, she has saved $1500. Since the birthday is still a few weeks away, Julie has time to save even more. She plans on mowing 20 lawns, delivering 600 newspapers, and walking 24 of her neighbors’ dogs. She is paid $20 for each lawn, 40 cents per newspaper, and $15 per dog. After purchasing the bike, how much money will Julie have left?
Answer: Mowing lawns will earn Julie 20 * 20 = 400 dollars. Her earnings, in dollars, from delivering newspapers will be 600 * 40 / 100 = 240 dollars. After walking 24 of her neighbor’s dogs, she will earn 24 * 15 = 360 dollars. She will therefore earn a total of 400 + 240 + 360 = 1000 dollars. Combining earnings from her job with her savings will give Julie 1000 + 1500 = 2500 dollars. Subtracting the cost of the mountain bike from the total will leave Julie with a balance of 2500 - 2345 = 155 dollars. The answer is 155.

Q: Maya's organization hosted a weekly farmers' market to raise money for the church choir. They sold broccolis, carrots, spinach, and cauliflowers. After adding together all of their earnings, Maya found out that they had made $380. The organization made $57 from broccoli and the sales of the carrots are twice as much as the sales of broccoli. Then, their sales for the spinach is $16 more than half of the sales of carrots. How much did they make from cauliflower sales?
A: The sales of the carrot is 57 x 2 = $114. Half the sales of carrot is $114 / 2 = $57. So, the sales of the spinach is $57 + $16 = 73. The total sales of the broccolis, carrots, spinach is $57 + $114 + $73 = $244. They made $380 - $244 = $136 from cauliflower sales. The answer is 136.
