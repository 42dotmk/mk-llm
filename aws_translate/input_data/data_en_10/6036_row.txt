Ohio was won by Donald Trump by a margin of 8.1 points. Prior to the election, most news organizations considered the Buckeye State as leaning Republican, due to his appeal to blue collar voters in the rust belt. Ohio kept its streak of voting for the winner (a bellwether state) since 1964, as it voted for Trump, who won nationally. Having voted Democratic in 2012 and 2008, the win margin was the second largest of the states Trump flipped Red (after Iowa). It is also the largest victory margin since George H.W. Bush defeated Michael Dukakis in 1988. Ohio was an unprecedented 10 points more Republican-leaning than the nation in 2016.
