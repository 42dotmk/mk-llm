(a). No

These two questions are inquiring about different aspects of technology. The first question is related to Continuously Variable Transmissions (CVTs) and their role in the future of transportation, especially with the advent of Electric Vehicles (EVs). The second question, on the other hand, is related to the functioning of n-channel Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (NMOS) when high voltage is applied to the gate.

To address each question individually:

1. CVTs and their role in the future of transportation:

Continuously Variable Transmissions (CVTs) are automatic transmissions that allow for an infinite number of gear ratios between a vehicle's lowest and highest gears. They offer a smooth driving experience and improved fuel efficiency compared to traditional automatic or manual transmissions. CVTs have been widely used in internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles for quite some time.

With the rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs), it may appear that CVTs may no longer hold a significant role in the future of transportation. The reason is that EVs have simpler drivetrain systems. They do not typically require multi-speed transmissions, as the electric motors in most EVs have the ability to deliver maximum torque across a wide range of speeds. This eliminates the need for gear shifting and allows for a more efficient, responsive, and smooth driving experience.

Furthermore, electric vehicles utilize a single-speed transmission, which drastically simplifies the entire drivetrain and allows for better packaging, reduced weight, lower cost, and improved reliability compared to some ICE vehicles.

However, this does not entirely rule out the possibility of CVTs playing a role in future transportation systems. Hybrid vehicles, which rely on a combination of combustion engines and electric motors, may continue to benefit from CVTs, especially for optimizing the ICE's efficiency in various driving situations.

In addition, advancements in CVT technology or specific EV applications may open up new opportunities for utilizing CVTs in electric powertrains. Some manufacturers are experimenting with multi-speed transmissions for electric cars to further improve driving dynamics or efficiency at high speeds.

2. High voltage applied to the gate of an NMOS:

When high voltage is applied to the gate of an n-channel MOSFET (NMOS), it conducts because of the formation of an electric field in the device's channel region. The gate voltage controls how much current flows between the drain and the source terminals. As an NMOS transistor operates, it switches between two states: the "on" state (conducting) and the "off" state (non-conducting).

When a high voltage (ideally above the threshold voltage) is applied to the gate terminal, an electric field is formed in the channel region, creating a conducting path between the source and drain terminals. The higher the voltage applied to the gate, the stronger the electric field and the lower the resistance of the channel, leading to an increase in current flow between the drain and source. This causes the NMOS device to be in the "on" state.

In summary, the two questions inquire about separate technological fields. The first question asks about the potential role of CVTs in the future transportation context, particularly with the rise of electric vehicles. The second question deals with the conductivity of NMOS transistors when high voltage is applied to the gate. Both topics are relevant and important in their respective domains but are not directly related to each other.
