Q: Brian has the same percentage of white stones and black stones in his collection of 100 stones as he does of grey stones and green stones in a separate collection. He has 40 grey stones and 60 green stones. How many white stones does Brian have if he has more white stones than black ones?
A: First we must determine the percentage of the grey and green stones. We add the two amounts together, finding 40 + 60 = 100. We then figure out that 40 / 100 = .4, meaning 40 percent of the stones are grey in the second selection. This means that 1.0 - .4 = .6, or 60 percent of the stones are green. Since there are more green stones than grey stones, and the white and black pile have the same percentage, and there are more white stones than black stones, that means there are 60 percent white stones in the first pile. Therefore, to find the number of white stones we multiply 100 * .6 = 60 white stones. The answer is 60.
Question: John has started at a job he works every day 10 days ago. So far, he's made $250. How many more days must John work before he makes twice this amount, assuming he makes the same amount every day?
Answer: John has made $250 in 10 days, so this means he makes $250 / 10 = 25 dollars a day. Since John wants to make double his current amount, this means he wants to make 250 * 2 = 500 dollars. This means John needs to work 500 / 25 = 20 days in total to make 500. As John has already worked 10 days, this means he needs to work 20 - 10 = 10 more days to make his goal. The answer is 10.
[Question]Lauren wanted to make burgers and fries for dinner. She needed a few things from the grocery store and bought the following: 2 pounds of hamburger meat that was on sale for $3.50 a pound. 1 pack of hamburger buns for $1.50. A head of lettuce for $1.00 and a large 1.5-pound tomato that was priced at $2.00 per pound. She also needed a jar of pickles that cost $2.50 and she had a $1.00 off coupon for that item. How much change would Lauren get back if she paid with a $20 bill?
[Answer]She bought 2 pounds of hamburger meat at $3.50 per pound so 2 * 3.50 = $7.00. The tomato weighed 1.5 pounds and cost $2.00 per pound so 1.5 * 2 = $3.00. When you add up all her items she spent 7 + 1.50 + 1 + 3 + 2.50 = $15.00. Her items added up to $15.00 and she had a $1.00 coupon off pickles so 15 - 1 = $14.00. She paid with a $20.00 bill so 20 - 14 = $6.00 in change. The answer is 6.
Q: It takes Omar 12 minutes to raise his kite 240 feet into the air. Jasper can raise his kite at three times the rate of speed as Omar can raise his kite. If Jasper raises his kite to a height of 600 feet, how many minutes will it take?
A: Jasper raises his kite at a rate of 240 feet in 12 minutes, or 240 / 12 = 20 feet per minute. Jasper raises his kite at three times the speed Omar does, or 3 * 20 = 60 feet per minute. To raise his kite 600 feet, it will take Jasper 600 / 60 = 10 minutes. The answer is 10.
Question: Beth has 72 marbles of three colors. Each color has the same amount of marbles. If Beth loses 5 red, twice as many blue, and three times as many yellow ones than red ones, how many marbles does she have left?
Answer: Beth has 72 / 3 = 24 marbles of each color. Beth has 24 - 5 = 19 red ones left. Beth lost 5 * 2 = 10 blue ones. Beth has 24 - 10 = 14 blue ones left. Beth lost 5 * 3 = 15 yellow ones. Beth has 24 - 15 = 9 yellow ones left. She has a total of 19 + 14 + 9 = 42 marbles left. The answer is 42.
