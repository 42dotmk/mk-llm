Question: Bob ordered 80 packs of Greek yogurt from Costco to use for the month. However, when the delivery arrived, he realized 40% of the packs were expired. He decided to return those packs. If each pack was $12, how much was Bob refunded for the expired product?
Answer: The number of Greek yogurt packs that had expired is 40 / 100 * 80 = 32. If each pack of Greek yogurt was sold at $12, for the 32 packs of greek yogurt that he returned, Bob was refunded $12 * 32 = $384. The answer is 384.
[Question]There are 80 men in a race. 1/4 of the men tripped and were unable to finish. 2/3 of the remaining men were dehydrated and 1/5 of those dehydrated men couldn't finish the race. How many men finished the race?
[Answer]1 / 4 of 80 men is 80 / 4 = 20 men. 20 men couldn't finish, so 80 - 20 = 60 men remain. 60 * 2 / 3 = 40 men were dehydrated. 1 / 5 of the dehydrated couldn't finish 40 * 1 / 5 = 8 men. 60 - 8 = 52 men finished the race. The answer is 52.
Q: Maddie wants to see how much her mom spends on coffee each week. She makes herself 2 cups of coffee per day. Each cup has 1.5 ounces of coffee beans. A bag of coffee costs $8 and contains 10.5 ounces of beans. She uses 1/2 a gallon of milk per week. A gallon of milk costs $4. She doesn't add any sugar to the coffee. How much does she spend on her coffee per week?
A: She uses 3 ounces of beans per day because 2 x 1.5 = 3. She uses 21 ounces of beans per week because 7 x 3 = 21. She buys 2 bags of beans per week because 21 / 10.5 = 2. She spends $16 on the beans per week because 2 x 8 = 16. She spends $2 on the milk per week because 4 x (1 / 2) = 2. She spends $18 per week on her coffee because 16 + 2 = 18. The answer is 18.
Question: Lilith originally had five dozen water bottles that she needed to sell at $2 each to get exactly enough money to buy her friend a birthday gift. However, at the store, Lilith realized she could not sell at $2 because the regular price was $1.85 per water bottle in her town, and she had to reduce her price to $1.85 as well to sell her water bottles. Calculate the total amount of money Lilith will have to find to buy her friend the birthday gift after selling her water bottles at the reduced cost.
Answer: Lilith had 5 dozen water bottles, and since a dozen has 12 water bottles, the total number of water bottles she had was 12 bottles / dozen * 5 dozen = 60 bottles. To buy her friend the birthday gift, Lilith originally had to sell her water bottles for a total of 60 bottles * $2 / bottle = $120. When she reduced the price to $1.85 to meet the regular price, the total amount of money she had from the sales was $1.85 / bottle * 60 bottles = $111. To buy her friend the birthday gift, Lilith has to find $120 - $111 = $9 more. The answer is 9.
[Question]There are 480 grains of rice in one cup. If half a cup is 8 tablespoons and one tablespoon is 3 teaspoons, how many grains of rice are in a teaspoon?
[Answer]First find the number of tablespoons in a full cup: 8 tablespoons / half - cup * 2 half - cups / cup = 16 tablespoons. Then find the total number of teaspoons in a cup: 16 tablespoons / cup * 3 teaspoons / tablespoon = 48 teaspoons. Then find the number of grains of rice per teaspoon: 480 grains / 48 teaspoons = 10 grains / teaspoon. The answer is 10.
