[Question]The ratio of the amount of money Cara, Janet, and Jerry have is 4:5:6. If the total amount of money they have is $75, calculate the loss Cara and Janet will make if they combine their money to buy oranges and sell them at 80% of the buying price.
[Answer]The sum of the ratios representing the amount of money the three has is 4 + 5 + 6 = 15. If the total amount of money they have is $75, the amount of money Cara has represented by the fraction 4 / 15 is 4 / 15 * $75 = $20. Similarly, the amount of money Janet has represented by the fraction 5 / 15 of the total ratio is 5 / 15 * $75 = $25. Combined, Cara and Janet have $20 + 25 = $45. If Cara and Janet buy goods worth $45 and sells them at 80% of the buying price, the selling price of the goods will be 80 / 100 * $45 = $36. Since they bought the goods at $45 and sold them at $36, Janet and Cara would run at a loss of $45 - $36 = $9. The answer is 9.
Q: Yanna baked twenty butter cookies and forty biscuits in the morning. In the afternoon, she baked ten butter cookies and twenty biscuits. How many more biscuits did she bake than butter cookies?

Question: Mr. Rocky went to the market to sell his handmade crafts on a particular week. He was selling jewelry at $30 each and paintings at $100 each. However, he realized the income from the sales wasn't worth the labor and materials he had used, so he decided to increase the price of jewelry by $10 each and the cost of each painting by 20%. Calculate the total price a buyer who takes two pieces of jewelry and five paintings would pay
Answer: After increasing the price of a piece of jewelry, the price increased from $30 to $30 + $10 = $40 each. He also increased the price of each painting by 20 / 100 * 100 = $20. The total price for buying one painting at the new price is $100 + $20 = $120. If a buyer purchases two pieces of jewelry, the total cost becomes 2 * $40 = $80. When the buyer also buys 5 paintings, he pays a total of $120 * 5 = $600. 2 pieces of jewelry and 5 paintings cost $600 + $80 = $680 at the new prices. The answer is 680.
[Question]Lillian went out to forage for mushrooms with her handy guidebook. She found 32 mushrooms and used her guidebook to identify which ones were poisonous and which were safe to eat. In the end, she had 9 mushrooms she could safely eat for dinner. Of the rest, she identified twice the amount she ate as poisonous, and a remaining bunch she was uncertain about. How many mushrooms was she uncertain were safe or poisonous?
[Answer]Lillian found 9 of the mushrooms were safe, so there were 32 - 9 = 23 that she found poisonous or uncertain. She knew twice the amount she ate were poisonous, so she found 9 * 2 = 18 poisonous mushrooms. Thus, she was uncertain about 23 - 18 = 5 mushrooms. The answer is 5.
Q: Six kids and two adults are going to the circus. Kid's tickets are on sale for only half of the adult tickets. The total cost is $50. How much is one kid's ticket?
A: Let X be the price of one kid's ticket. So the price of one adult ticket is X * 2. Five kids and two adults are going to the circus, so 6 * X + 2 * (X * 2) = $50. So 10X = $50. So the price of one kid's ticket is X = $5. The answer is 5.
