Jacob earns $20 per hour * 10 hours = $200 for working. So he earns $4 each * 24 = $96 for the cookies. So far he has earned $200 + $96 = $296. He buys a lottery ticket so $296 - $10 = $286 was left in his money. After winning in a lottery, he had a total of $500 + $286 = $786. He gets $500 * 2 per sister = $1000 from her sisters. So he has so far $1000 + $786 = $1786. He needs $5000 - $1786 = $3214.
The answer: 3214
Reverse engineering the question: Jacoby wants to save money for a trip to Brickville. He needs to have $5000 total to go on his trip. He works a job earning $20 per hour and works 10 hours. He then finds he can sell cookies for $4 each, and he sells 24 pieces of cookies. With the money he has so far, he buys a lottery ticket for $10 and wins $500. Finally, he gets $500 from both of his sisters as a gift. How much more, in dollars, does Jacob need to go to Brickville?

Reasoning and answer: Phoebe is having 20 guests and Monica charges $25.00 per person so that’s 20 * 25 = $500.00. Phoebe is a repeat customer so she gets 10% off of $500.00 so that’s .10 * 500 = $50.00 discount. Monica is charging $500.00 minus the repeat customer discount of $50.00 so she will make 500 - 50 = $450.00.
The answer: 450

Question: Monica charges $25.00 per person when catering a dinner party. For repeat customers, she offers a 10% discount. Phoebe is a repeat customer who is having a dinner party for 20 guests. How much will Monica make from the party?

If a paint mixer takes three days to make 18 drums of paint in a day, he makes 18 / 3 = 6 drums of paint. The number of days it will take for him to make 360 drums of paint, making 6 drums a day, is 360 / 6 = 60 days.
The answer: 60
Reverse engineering the question: Making an equal number of drums of paint each day, a paint mixer takes three days to make 18 drums of paint. How many days will it take for him to make 360 drums of paint?

Reasoning and answer: First find the percentage of ads that aren't interesting: 100% - 20% = 80%. Then multiply that percentage by the percentage of ads that don't get blocked to find the percentage of ads that meet both criteria: 80% * 20% = 16%.
The answer: 16

Question: Hannah's AdBlock blocks all but 20% of ads, and 20% of the ads it doesn't block are actually interesting. What percentage of ads aren't interested and don't get blocked?

If "x" is the number of European swallows, then, for every one European swallow, there would be 2x American swallows. Thus, the total number of swallows would be 2x + x = 90 swallows. Thus, the number of European swallows x = 30. And the number of American swallows is 90 - 30 = 60. A European swallow can carry twice what an American swallow can carry, or 2 * 5 = 10 pounds. 30 European swallows can carry a maximum of 30 * 10 = 300 pounds. 60 American swallows can carry a maximum of 60 * 5 = 300 pounds. Thus, a flock of 90 birds, with 30 European and 60 American swallows, can carry 300 + 300 = 600 pounds.
The answer: 600
Reverse engineering the question: The American swallow can lift into the air and carry a maximum of 5 pounds of weight, while the European swallow can lift and carry twice the weight as the American swallow. If there was a flock of 90 swallows, containing twice as many American as European swallows, what is the maximum combined weight the flock can carry?

1 hour is 60 minutes, so 120 minutes is 120 / 60 = 2 hours. During one hour a fox can make 50 kilometers, so during two hours, he would be able to run 50 * 2 = 100 kilometers.
The answer: 100
