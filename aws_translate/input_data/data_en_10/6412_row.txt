Q: Carl is figuring out how much he'll need to spend on gas for his upcoming road trip to the Grand Canyon. His car gets 30 miles per gallon in cities and 40 miles per gallon on the highway. The distance from his house to the Grand Canyon, one way, is 60 city miles and 200 highway miles. If gas costs $3.00 per gallon, how much will Carl need to spend?
A: First figure out how many city miles Carl will drive round trip by multiplying the one - way number of city miles by 2: 60 miles * 2 = 120 miles. Then figure out how many highway miles Carl will drive round trip by multiplying the one - way number of highway miles by 2: 200 miles * 2 = 400 miles. Now divide the round - trip number of city miles by the number of city miles per gallon Carl's car gets: 120 miles / 30 mpg = 4 gallons. Now divide the round - trip number of highway miles by the number of highway miles per gallon Carl's car gets: 400 miles / 40 mpg = 10 gallons. Now add the gallons for the highway miles and the city miles to find the total number of gallons Carl needs to buy: 10 gallons + 4 gallons = 14 gallons. Finally, multiply the number of gallons Carl needs to buy by the cost per gallon to find out how much he spends: 14 gallons * $3.00 = $42.00. The answer is 42.
Question: Ben has two brothers. They can each eat 12 slices of pizza. They are ordering pizza for the night and want to make sure they get enough. The large pizzas have 14 slices and the small pizzas have 8. If they order 1 small pizza, how many large pizzas do they need to order?
Answer: They need 36 slices because 3 x 12 = 36. After ordering the small, they need 28 slices because 36 - 8 = 28. They need 2 large pizzas because 28 / 14 = 2. The answer is 2.
[Question]Reese has been practicing piano for four hours every week. How many hours will he practice after five months?
[Answer]If Reese practices 4 four hours every week, in a month, with four weeks, he would have practiced for 4 * 4 = 16 hours. In five months, Reese would have practiced for 5 * 16 = 80 hours. The answer is 80.
Q: Happy Cattle Ranch is home to 200 cows. Every year, the mother cows have enough calves that the number of cows the rancher owns rises by half the number of cows living on the ranch. If the rancher does not buy or sell any cows, how many cows will the rancher own on Happy Cattle Ranch in two years?
A: In one year, the rancher will have 200 + 200 / 2 = 200 + 100 = 300 cows. In two years, the rancher will have 300 + 300 / 2 = 300 + 150 = 450 cows. The answer is 450.
Question: Ellen is painting flowers on a vase. It takes her 5 minutes to paint a lily, 7 minutes to paint a rose, 3 minutes to paint an orchid, and 2 minutes to paint a vine. How long will it take her to paint 17 lilies, 10 roses, 6 orchids and 20 vines?
Answer: First find the total time Ellen spends painting lilies: 5 minutes / lily * 17 lilies = 85 minutes. Then find the total time Ellen spends painting roses: 7 minutes / lily * 10 roses = 70 minutes. Then find the total time Ellen spends painting orchids: 3 minutes / orchid * 6 orchids = 18 minutes. Then find the total time Ellen spends painting vines: 2 minutes / lily * 20 vines = 40 minutes. Then add the amount of time Ellen spends on each type of flower to find the total time: 85 minutes + 70 minutes + 18 minutes + 40 minutes = 213 minutes. The answer is 213.
