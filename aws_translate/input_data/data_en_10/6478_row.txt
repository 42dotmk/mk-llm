Q: Jo-Bob hopped into the hot air balloon, released the anchor rope, and pulled on the lift chain, which ignited the flame and provided the warm air that caused the balloon to rise. When the lift chain was pulled, the balloon would rise at a rate of 50 feet per minute. But when the chain was not being pulled, the balloon would slowly descend at a rate of 10 feet per minute. During his balloon ride, he pulled the chain for 15 minutes, then released the rope for 10 minutes, then pulled the chain for another 15 minutes, and finally released the chain and allowed the balloon to slowly descend back to the earth. During his balloon ride, what was the highest elevation reached by the balloon?
A: The first 15 - minute chain pull caused the balloon to rise 50 * 15 = 750 feet. Releasing the chain for 10 minutes caused the balloon to descend 10 * 10 = 100 feet. The second 15 - minute chain pull caused the balloon to rise another 50 * 15 = 750 feet. Thus, at the end of the second chain pull, when the balloon was at its highest elevation, the balloon had risen to an elevation of 750 - 100 + 750 = 1400 feet above the earth's surface. The answer is 1400.
Question: Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?
Answer: They are 9 slices of cheese because 16 - 7 = 9. They ate three slices of cheese each because 9 / 3 = 3. They are 6 slices each in total because 3 x 2 = 6. The answer is 6.
[Question]Timmy, Tommy and Tina are filling up a kiddie pool in their backyard. Each has a pail they fill with water from a house before dumping it into the pool. If Timmy's pail holds twice as much water as Tommy's, and Tommy's holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, and Tina's is 4 gallons, how much water do the three of them fill the pool with after 3 trips each?
[Answer]If Tina's pail holds 4 gallons and Tommy's holds 2 more gallons than hers, that means Tommy's holds 4 + 2 = 6 gallons. If Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's 6 - gallon pail, that means it holds 6 * 2 = 12 gallons. Therefore, in 1 trip that means all three move a total of 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 gallons. In three trips, that means they would move a total of 22 * 3 = 66 gallons. The answer is 66.
Q: John assembles computers and sells prebuilt computers as a business. The parts for the computer cost $800. He sells the computers for 1.4 times the value of the components. He manages to build 60 computers a month. He has to pay $5000 a month in rent and another $3000 in non-rent extra expenses a month. How much profit does he make a month?
A: He sells each computer for 1.4 * 800 = $1120. That means he makes a profit of 1120 - 800 = $320 per computer. So he makes 320 * 60 = $19200 from selling computers. He has extra expenses of 5000 + 3000 = $8000 a month. So his profit is 19200 - 8000 = $11,200. The answer is 11200.
Question: James buys 5 packs of sodas that are 12 sodas each. He had 10 sodas already. He finishes all the sodas in 1 week. How many sodas does he drink a day?
Answer: He bought 5 * 12 = 60 sodas. So he had 60 + 10 = 70 sodas. So he drank 70 / 7 = 10 sodas per day. The answer is 10.
