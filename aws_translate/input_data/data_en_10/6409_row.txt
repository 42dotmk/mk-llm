Q: Jean has three times as much money as Jane. They have a combined total of $76. How much money does Jean have?
A: Let's assume the total amount of money that Jane has is m. Since Jean has 3 times as much money as Jane, he has 3 * m = 3m. Combined, Jean and Jane have a total of m + 3m = $76. This evaluates to 4m = $76. The total amount of money that Jane has, represented by m, is m = $76 / 4. Jane has m = $19. Since Jean has three times as much money as Jane, Jean has 3 * $19 = $57. The answer is 57.
Question: Giorgio plans to make cookies for his class. There are 40 students and he plans to make 2 cookies per student. If 10% of his classmates want oatmeal raisin, then how many oatmeal raisin cookies will Giorgio make?

[Question]Between them, Mark and Sarah have 24 traffic tickets. Mark has twice as many parking tickets as Sarah, and they each have an equal number of speeding tickets. If Sarah has 6 speeding tickets, how many parking tickets does Mark have?
[Answer]First figure out how many total speeding tickets the two people got by adding the 6 speeding tickets Sarah got to the equal number (6) that Mark got: 6 + 6 = 12. Now subtract the combined number of speeding tickets from the total number of tickets to find the combined number of parking tickets: 24 - 12 = 12. Now express Mark's number of parking tickets in terms of the number of parking tickets Sarah got: m = 2s. We know that m + s = 12, so substitute in the value of m from the previous step to get 2s + s = 12. Combine like terms to get 3s = 12. Divide both sides of the equation to get s = 4. Now multiply the number of parking tickets Sarah got by 2 to find the number Mark got: 4 * 2 = 8. The answer is 8.
Q: Pauline has a garden with vegetables. In it, Pauline has planted 3 kinds of tomatoes - 5 of each kind, 5 kinds of cucumbers - 4 of each kind, and 30 potatoes. In the whole garden, there are 10 rows with 15 spaces in each to plant any vegetable. How many more vegetables could Pauline plant in her garden?
A: Pauline planted in total 3 * 5 = 15 tomatoes. Pauline also planted 5 * 4 = 20 cucumbers. In total Pauline planted 15 + 20 + 30 = 65 different vegetables. The whole garden can be filled up with 10 * 15 = 150 different vegetables. So Pauline could plant 150 - 65 = 85 more vegetables in her garden. The answer is 85.
Question: A small pizza can gives 4 slices, and a large pizza gives 8 slices. George purchased 3 small and 2 large pizzas. George would like to eat 3 pieces. His friend Bob would like to eat one more piece than George. Susie will eat half as many as Bob. Bill, Fred and Mark would each like 3 pieces. How many slices of pizza will be left over?
Answer: George has 3 small pizzas * 4 slices = 12 pieces. George also has 2 large pizzas * 8 slices = 16 slices. Total, George has 12 + 16 slices = 28 slices of pizza. Bob will eat 3 slices + 1 = 4 slices. Susie will eat 1 / 2 * 4 slices = 2 slices. Bob, Fred and Mark will eat in total 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 pieces. Total slices of pizza eaten will be 3 + 4 + 2 + 9 = 18 pieces. Total pizza slices remaining will be 28 pieces - 18 = 10 slices left. The answer is 10.
