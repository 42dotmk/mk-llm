While the questions "How can I speak English fluently?" and "How can I be a native English speaker?" are related with their emphasis on English language proficiency, they don't hold exactly the same meaning.

The question "How can I speak English fluently?" is about gaining a high level of proficiency in the English language. It is about the ability to communicate smoothly and effortlessly without any struggles or breaks in conversation. Many non-native English speakers aim for this kind of fluency to be able to interact, study, or work in English-speaking environments comfortably.

On the other hand, the question "How can I be a native English speaker?" refers quite literally to someone who has grown up speaking English, typically learning it from their parents and community from a young age. It's important to note that native level proficiency in a language is not just about grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation but also understanding the nuances, idioms, metaphors, cultural practices, and contextual cues of the language. 

Here are some steps to help you speak English fluently:

1. **Regular Practice**: Practicing regularly is the key to mastering any language. The more you practice, the more fluent you'll become. This practice could involve speaking English with friends or colleagues, attending language classes, and incorporating it into your daily life.

2. **Expand Vocabulary**: Vocabulary is the building block of a language. The more words you know, the more articulate and fluent you can be. Consider having a dedicated vocabulary learning routine, which might involve flashcards, vocabulary apps, and reading in English.

3. **Improve Pronunciation**: Understand the correct pronunciation of words. This will not only increase your confidence but also improve your comprehension skills. Listening to English songs, podcasts, and watching movies or series can be helpful.

4. **Reading and Listening Skills**: Reading English newspapers, magazines, books, or online articles can help you gain a better understanding of sentence structures and grammar usage. Similarly, listening to English podcasts, news, and songs can improve your listening abilities and pronunciation.

5. **Grammar**: While speaking fluently involves more than just proper grammar, good grammar is still a cornerstone of effective communication. Study grammar and use resources to understand how sentences are correctly constructed in English.

6. **Conversation Practice**: Try to find a conversation partner with whom to practice. This can be a local meet-up group, a language exchange partner online, or even a paid tutor. The key is to practice speaking in real conversation scenarios.

7. **Think in English**: This might sound hard, but it's doable with practice. When you start thinking in English, you'll stop translating between your native language and English which will make your spoken English more fluent.

However, becoming a native English speaker as a foreigner is technically impossible because native speakers are persons who learned the language as their first language in childhood. Yet, you could aim for the proficiency level of a native English speaker by embracing the culture, idioms, phrases, slang, pronunciation peculiar to native English speakers.

It's important to remember that everyone learns at a different pace and in different ways, so it might take some experimenting to find the best route for you. And while perfect fluency might seem like the ultimate goal, it's also important to enjoy the learning process itself.
