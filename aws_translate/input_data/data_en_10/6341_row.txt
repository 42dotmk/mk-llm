The answers to both questions cannot be answered by choosing either [a]. no or [b]. yes, as these questions require detailed information. Below, I will provide long and detailed answers to both questions asked:

Question 1: How Common is HIV in the US?

HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks the immune system. In the United States, HIV remains a significant public health issue. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 1.2 million people aged 13 and older in the US were living with HIV at the end of 2018. Each year, there are about 36,400 new HIV infections in the United States.

Certain populations are disproportionately affected by HIV. For example, gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men made up about 69% of new HIV diagnoses in 2018. Moreover, African Americans and Hispanic/Latino individuals are also disproportionately affected, with African Americans accounting for 42% of new HIV diagnoses, and Hispanic/Latinos accounting for 27% in the same year.

Efforts to reduce the number of new HIV infections and improve the health outcomes for people living with HIV have been increasingly emphasized in recent years, including the implementation of routine HIV testing, the promotion of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and better access to healthcare and support services.

Question 2: How does HIV occur?

HIV is a retrovirus that primarily affects the human immune system, specifically targeting CD4+ T-cells, which play a critical role in the body's immune responses. It is transmitted through the exchange of certain bodily fluids, including blood, semen, vaginal and rectal fluids, and breast milk.

Here are the main ways through which HIV transmission can occur:

1. Sexual transmission: HIV can be transmitted through contact with infected semen or vaginal and rectal fluids during unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Using condoms, dental dams, and other barrier methods can significantly reduce the risk of transmission.

2. Mother-to-child transmission: HIV can be transmitted from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. Appropriate antiretroviral treatment and other preventive measures can significantly reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission.

3. Injection drug use: Sharing needles, syringes, or other injection equipment with someone infected with HIV can result in the transmission of the virus. Harm reduction strategies like needle exchange programs and the use of sterile injection supplies can help lower the risk of transmission.

4. Occupational exposure: Healthcare workers are at risk of exposure to HIV through needlestick injuries or contact with infected bodily fluids. Adherence to universal safety precautions, like wearing gloves and other personal protective equipment, can minimize this risk.

5. Blood transfusions and organ transplants: HIV can be transmitted through blood transfusions, organ/tissue transplants, or artificial insemination from an infected donor. However, since the early 1990s, improved screening procedures for blood and organ donations have made the risk of acquiring HIV through these routes extremely low in the United States.

HIV does NOT spread through casual contact, air or water, saliva, sweat, tears, or closed-mouth kissing, sharing toilet seats, or through insects like mosquitoes.

In conclusion, the answers to both questions cannot be reduced to a simple yes or no, as they require detailed information on the prevalence of HIV in the US and the methods of transmission for the virus.
