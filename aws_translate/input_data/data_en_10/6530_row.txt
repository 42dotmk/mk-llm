Step 1: Choose a movie to review
I'll choose a popular movie that has received a range of reviews and opinions so that I can focus on the negative aspects. For this task, I'll select the movie "Cats" (2019).

Step 2: Start with an attention-grabbing introductory statement
To create a negative sentiment, I'll start with a statement that criticizes the movie, emphasizing its flaws and generating interest in the review.

"The much-anticipated movie adaptation of the iconic Broadway musical "Cats" (2019) turned out to be a catastrophic misfire that left audiences bewildered and disappointed."

Step 3: Mention negative aspects of the movie
Next, I'll highlight specific areas where the movie failed to deliver, including visuals, direction, performances, and plot. By focusing on these negative aspects, I can maintain the negative sentiment throughout the review.

"With its discomforting blend of CGI and live-action visuals, "Cats" delivered a disorienting and unsettling experience for viewers. Directed by Tom Hooper, the movie struggled to synchronize the digital fur technology and human performances, resulting in an eerie hybrid that struggled to connect with the audience emotionally. The star-studded cast, featuring Jennifer Hudson, Judi Dench, and Ian McKellen, was unfortunately wasted on awkward musical numbers and melodramatic moments that did little to salvage the screenplay's lack of coherence and tangible plot."

Step 4: Draw comparisons to the source material (optional)
By comparing the movie to its source material, I can emphasize the disappointment many viewers might have felt after watching this adaptation.

"While the stage production of "Cats" remains a timeless classic, this 2019 movie adaptation failed to capture the magic and allure of its source material, leaving fans of the musical wishing they had stuck to the original."

Step 5: Closing statement
I'll end the review with a final statement that summarizes my negative sentiment about the film, reinforcing the overall negative sentiment.

"In conclusion, "Cats" (2019) is a bewildering and unsatisfying cinematic experience that fell far short of expectations and ultimately failed to rekindle the charm of the original Broadway musical. Fans and newcomers alike would do well to steer clear of this feline fiasco."
