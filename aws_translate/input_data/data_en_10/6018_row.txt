(II). yes.

Both questions are essentially asking for an analysis of the reasons behind Hillary Clinton's loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 United States Presidential election. To provide a detailed and long answer for this, I will identify and examine various factors that contributed to the outcome.

1. Populist sentiment and the anti-establishment wave: The 2016 election took place during a time when voters in the U.S. and around the world were increasingly expressing dissatisfaction with the political establishment. Trump was able to capitalize on this sentiment by running as a political outsider who promised to "drain the swamp" in Washington, D.C. In contrast, Clinton, having served as a Senator and Secretary of State, was seen by many as a key member of the establishment.

2. Economic anxiety: Many voters, particularly in the Rust Belt states (such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin), were experiencing economic hardship, with job losses in manufacturing and stagnating wages. Trump's message of reviving jobs and renegotiating trade agreements resonated with these voters, while Clinton's economic platform was perceived as less transformative.

3. Controversies surrounding Hillary Clinton: Throughout the campaign, Clinton was plagued by a series of controversies, including the use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State, her handling of the Benghazi attack, and her paid speeches to Wall Street firms. These issues fueled the perception that she was untrustworthy and reinforced negative preconceptions about her character.

4. Partisanship and political polarization: The 2016 election occurred during a period of increased partisanship and political polarization within the U.S. Many voters on both sides rejected the candidates of the opposing party, and some Republicans who may have been dissatisfied with Trump still voted for him because of their opposition to Clinton.

5. Media coverage and the role of social media: Both Trump and Clinton received widespread media attention, but Trump's controversial statements and tweets often dominated the headlines and conversation, drawing focus away from policy discussions. Additionally, the spreading of fake news and misinformation on social media platforms may have influenced public opinion.

6. The role of third-party candidates: In 2016, third-party candidates like Gary Johnson (Libertarian) and Jill Stein (Green) garnered a higher percentage of votes than in previous elections. This may have siphoned off votes from Clinton, particularly in closely contested states.

7. Voter turnout and apathy: Lower voter turnout among key Democratic demographics, such as young people and minority groups, may have contributed to Clinton's loss. It's possible that the enthusiasm for her candidacy did not match that of Obama in the previous elections, leading some potential supporters to stay home.

8. The impact of the FBI investigation: In the final weeks of the campaign, then-FBI Director James Comey announced the reopening of the investigation into Clinton's email server. This announcement may have negatively impacted her standing in the polls and reinforced doubts about her trustworthiness.

In conclusion, the reasons for Hillary Clinton's loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election are multifaceted and include economic anxiety, political polarization, controversies surrounding her candidacy, the impact of third-party candidates, voter turnout and apathy, and outside influences such as the role of the FBI and media coverage.
