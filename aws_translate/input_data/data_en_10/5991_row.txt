Q: Itzayana is 4 inches taller than Zora, who is 8 inches shorter than Brixton. If Zara is 64 inches tall and has the same height as Brixton, calculate the average height of the four people.
A: Since Brixton has the same height as Zara which is 64 inches, Zora, who is 8 inches shorter than Brixton, is 64 - 8 = 56 inches tall. Zara and Brixton's height is 64 + 64 = 128 inches. If you add Zora's height, the three have a total height of 128 + 56 = 184. Itzayana is 4 inches taller than Zoran which means she is 56 + 4 = 60 inches tall. The total height of the four friends is 60 + 184 = 244. The average height of the three is 244 / 4 = 61. The answer is 61.
Question: Javier is an Olympic javelin thrower. In the last Olympics, he threw the javelin three times. The first throw, he threw the javelin twice as far as he threw the javelin on his second throw, but only half as far as he threw it the third throw. If the sum of all three throws was 1050 meters, then how far, in meters, did he throw the javelin on his first throw?
Answer: Let x be the distance he threw the javelin on the first throw. Thus, the sum of his three throws is x + 0.5x + 2x = 1050 meters. Thus, 3.5x = 1050. And we find the distance he threw the javelin on the first throw is x = 300 meters. The answer is 300.
[Question]A one-way ticket costs $2. A 30-day pass costs $50. What's the minimum number of rides you will need to take every month so that the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride?
[Answer]For the 30 - day pass to be cheaper, then the average fare should be cheaper than the $2 one - way ticket. If the 30 - day pass costs $50, then I should take at least $50 / $2 = 25 rides to pay the same as a one - way ticket. However, given that we want the 30 - day pass per ride to be strictly cheaper we should ride at least 25 + 1 = 26 times. The answer is 26.
Q: Bucky earns money each weekend catching and selling fish. He wants to save up for a new video game, which costs $60. Last weekend he earned $35. He can earn $5 from trout and $4 from blue-gill. He caught five fish this Sunday. If 60% were trout, and the rest were blue-gill, how much more does he need to save before he can buy the game?
A: He is $25 short for the game because 60 - 35 = 25. He caught 3 trout because 5 x .6 = 3. He caught 2 blue - gill because 5 - 3 = 2. He earned $15 from the trout because 3 x 5 = 15. He earned $8 from the blue - gill because 2 x 4 = 8. He earned $23 total because 15 + 8 = 23. He is $2 short because 25 - 23 = 2. The answer is 2.
Question: Students at Highridge High earn 2 points for each correct answer during a quiz bowl If a student correctly answers all the questions in a round, the student is awarded an additional 4 point bonus. They played a total of five rounds each consisting of five questions. If James only missed one question, how many points did he get?
Answer: If James only missed one question in all five rounds of five questions, he correctly answered 5 * 5 - 1 = 24 questions. Before the bonus, James earned 24 correct answers * 2 points / answer = 48 points. Since missing one question would only disqualify him from receiving a bonus in one round, he would earn a bonus for 5 - 1 = 4 rounds. He should expect a bonus of 4 rounds * 4 points / round = 16 points. Including his bonus, James scored a total of 48 + 16 = 64 points. The answer is 66.
