Q: Betty is growing parsnips in her vegetable garden. When the parsnips are grown, they are harvested and bundled into boxes that can hold up to 20 parsnips each. Each harvest, three-quarters of the boxes are full, and the remaining boxes are half-full. She gets an average of 20 boxes each harvest. How many parsnips does Betty grow in an average harvest?
A: If three - quarters of the boxes are full, then 1 – ¾ = ¼ of the boxes are half - full. On average, each harvest therefore has 20 boxes * 0.25 = 5 boxes that are half - full. This leaves 20 total boxes – 5 half - full boxes = 15 full boxes. Half - full boxes hold 20 parsnips / 2 = 10 parsnips each. In total, the half - full boxes, therefore, hold 5 boxes * 10 parsnips = 50 parsnips. The full boxes hold a total of 15 boxes * 20 parsnips = 300 parsnips. So Betty harvests a total of 50 + 300 = 350 parsnips in an average harvest. The answer is 350.
Question: Nate starts his camping trip with 70 matches. He drops 10 in a creek and his dog eats twice as many. How many matches does he have left?
Answer: First find the number of matches the dog eats: 10 matches * 2 = 20 matches. Then subtract all the lost matches from the starting number to find the final number: 70 matches - 10 matches - 20 matches = 40 matches. The answer is 40.
[Question]Jackson is making dinner. He makes a salad out of lettuce (50 calories), carrots (twice the calories of the lettuce) and dressing (210 calories). He also makes a pizza with 600 calories for the crust, 1/3 the crust's calories for the pepperoni, and 400 calories for the cheese. If Jackson eats 1/4 of the salad and 1/5 of the pizza, how many calories does he eat?
[Answer]First find the number of calories in the carrots: 50 calories * 2 = 100 calories. Then find the total calories in the salad: 100 calories + 50 calories + 210 calories = 360 calories. Then find the number of calories in the pepperoni: 1 / 3 * 600 calories = 200 calories. Now find the total number of calories in the pizza: 200 calories + 600 calories + 400 calories = 1200 calories. Now find how many calories are in Jackson's portion of the salad: 360 calories * 1 / 4 = 90 calories. Now find how many calories are in Jackson's portion of the pizza: 1200 calories * 1 / 5 = 240 calories. Now find the total calories Jackson ate: 90 calories + 240 calories = 330 calories. The answer is 330.
Q: After negotiating for the price of a phone, Karsyn bought a phone at 20% of the initial price. If the phone's initial price was $600, calculate how much she paid after negotiating.
A: If the initial price was $600, after negotiating the price, Karsyn paid 20 / 100 * $600 = $120 less. The price at which she bought the phone is $600 - $120 = $480. The answer is 480.
Question: Brianna reads two books a month. This year, she was given six new books as a gift, she bought eight new books, and she plans to borrow two fewer new books than she bought from the library. How many of her old books from her old book collection will she have to reread to have two books to read a month this year?
Answer: Brianna needs 12 * 2 = 24 books to get her through the year. She will borrow 8 - 2 = 6 new books from the library. With the books she was given, the books she bought, and the library books, she will have 6 + 8 + 6 = 20 new books to read this year. Thus, she will need to reread 24 - 20 = 4 of her old books this year. The answer is 4.
