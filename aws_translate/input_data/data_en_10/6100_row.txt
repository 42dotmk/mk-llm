Question 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They are related to two different concepts. Let me explain each question to you separately.

Question 1: How do I calculate effective nuclear charge by Slater's rule?

Slater's rules are a set of empirical rules created by John C. Slater to estimate the effective nuclear charge (Z_eff) on an electron in an atom. The effective nuclear charge is a measure of the net positive charge experienced by an electron in a multi-electron atom, considering electron shielding.

To calculate the effective nuclear charge (Z_eff) using Slater's rules, follow these steps:

1. Identify the electron for which you want to calculate Z_eff (called the test electron) and its electron configuration.

2. Group the electrons into the following sets:
   - All electrons in lower-shelled orbitals (n-1, n-2, ..., 1)
   - Electrons in the same shell, same type of orbital as the test electron (n, l)
   - Electrons in the same shell, but different type of orbital as the test electron (n, lÂ±1)

3. Assign a shielding constant "S" for each group:
   - For each electron in a lower shell, assign a shielding value of 0.85.
   - For each electron in the same shell and same type of orbital as the test electron, assign a value of 0.35.
   - For each electron in the same shell but different type of orbital, assign a value of 0.40 for s & p electrons, 0.35 for d electrons, and 0.30 for f electrons.

4. Calculate the total shielding S by summing up the shielding values assigned to each electron.

5. Finally, calculate the effective nuclear charge (Z_eff) by subtracting the shielding value from the atomic number (Z): 
   Z_eff = Z - S

Question 2: How do I wirelessly charge electrical devices by the piezoelectric effect?

The piezoelectric effect is the process by which certain materials generate an electric charge in response to applied mechanical stress. To wirelessly charge electrical devices using the piezoelectric effect, you can follow these general steps:

1. Choose a suitable piezoelectric material for your application, such as quartz, gallium phosphate, or a type of ceramic like lead zirconate titanate (PZT). The material should have good piezoelectric properties and be able to handle the amount of stress needed to generate a sufficient voltage.

2. Design and fabricate a piezoelectric transducer/energy harvester. This device converts mechanical stress applied to the piezoelectric material into electrical voltage.

3. Apply mechanical stress to the piezoelectric material, either by compression, bending or vibration. This could come from sources like footsteps, machinery vibrations, or even ambient noise. The applied stress will generate an electric charge in the material.

4. Connect the piezoelectric transducer to a rectifier circuit to convert the generated alternating current (AC) voltage to direct current (DC) voltage, which is suitable for charging electronic devices.

5. Use a power management circuit to regulate the output voltage to match the charging requirements of the target electrical device.

6. Finally, integrate a wireless charging transmitter (inductive or resonant) to transfer the stored energy to the target device's wireless charging receiver. The charging process can then take place wirelessly and without physical contact.

Keep in mind that the feasibility and efficiency of this charging method depend on factors such as the size and properties of the piezoelectric material, the amplitude of the mechanical stress, and the specific power requirements of the device being charged.
