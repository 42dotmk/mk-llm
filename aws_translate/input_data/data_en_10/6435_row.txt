While your statement might lend an air of mystery and intrigue to ancient Egyptian stonework, it's not entirely accurate based on current archeological knowledge and understanding.

The prowess of ancient Egyptians in stonework is indeed impressive, marveled at through the ages, and is a subject of many studies. Their accomplishments have stood the test of time and are visible today in the grand edifices such as the Great Pyramids, Sphinx, Obelisks, statues, and more. Although the processes and methods they used in achieving such an extraordinary level of precision and imagination in their stonework may have been initially shrouded in mystery, archaeological findings, rigorous studies, and scientific developments over years have allowed us to uncover several of their methods.

Visiting the ancient quarries can certainly provide insight into how they extracted and shaped the stones. The archaeological evidence, such as the remains of tools, quarry marks, and cut-stone waste in the quarry area, help reconstruct the process of stone extraction and initial shaping. It is believed that they used tools such as hardened bronze and copper chisels, as well as a technique known as "fire-setting" wherein they would light a fire to heat the rock, then quickly cool it with water, making it far easier to break apart.

Moreover, detailed studies on the ancient structures, aided by modern techniques like microscopy, chemical analysis, and geology, have offered further clarity. For instance, it is now understood that the Egyptians employed a unique method to transport the massive blocks of limestone and granite. They most likely used large sledges which were dragged over wet sand, significantly reducing the friction and making transportation of such large weights feasible.

While the construction techniques from the Pyramids built around 2600 BC might not be entirely understood, the later monuments like the temples constructed during the New Kingdom period (around 1550 – 1069 BC) are better understood due to the preservation of more extensive resources and tools.

Additionally, various pieces of evidence in ancient Egyptian textual material, including inscriptions, paintings, and papyri, provide further insight into their construction methods. For instance, the illustrations in the tomb of Rekhmire, a vizier during the reign of Thutmose III, distinctly represent a scene of stone-cutting.

However, it is important to note that while scholars are confident about these discovered methods, some secrets of the ancient Egyptians' stonework do remain a mystery due to the lack of comprehensive and written records detailing the exact methods. The limitations in replicating the precision and finesse of their work with same ancient techniques also add to the mystery. Therefore, these points might lend some credibility to your statement.

In conclusion, while we have managed to uncover a significant amount regarding ancient Egyptian stonework techniques, there are aspects of their practices that remain as yet undiscovered, keeping the intrigue alive. However, it wouldn't be entirely accurate to term it as "one of the best kept secrets" due to the considerable progress made in understanding their techniques. This field is an area of ongoing research and interpretations, and every new archaeological discovery adds a bit more to our understanding of their extraordinary skills. 

Overall, continuing to explore and analyze Egypt’s ancient quarries and structures is certain to further enhance our knowledge of the ancient Egyptians' advanced construction skills and practices.
