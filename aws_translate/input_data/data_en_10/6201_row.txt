[Question]Sab and Dane sold 6 pairs of shoes that cost $3 each and 18 shirts that cost $2. How much will each of them earn if they divided their total earning?
[Answer]They earned 6 x $3 = $18 for the shoes they sold. They earned 18 x $2 = 36 for the shirts they sold. So, they earned $18 + $36 = $54 in total for the clothing they sold. Therefore, Sab and Dane earned $54 / 2 = $27 each. The answer is 27.
Q: Steven is preparing a shipment of boxes to deliver to a customer for his chemical supply business. The products are very delicate and must be carefully packed, so partially filled boxes can’t be shipped. Steven has three trucks that can be sent on each delivery. Each truck can carry a load of no more than 2,000 pounds of cargo. Some of the boxes weigh 10 pounds after being packed, and some of the boxes weigh 40 pounds when packed. Steven’s customer has ordered equal quantities of both the lighter and heavier products. How many boxes of products can Steven ship to his customer in each delivery?
A: Each pair of boxes weighs 40 pounds + 10 pounds, or 50 pounds. Each pair weighs 50 pounds, so the delivery trucks can carry 2000 / 50 pairs of boxes or 40 pairs. Steven has three trucks, so each trip can move 40 * 3 pairs of boxes = 120 pairs of boxes. Each pair is a set of two boxes, so each delivery contains 120 * 2 boxes = 240 boxes. The answer is 240.
Question: Of the 90 people on William's bus, 3/5 were Dutch. Of the 1/2 of the Dutch who were also American, 1/3 got window seats. What's the number of Dutch Americans who sat at the windows?
Answer: On the bus, the number of Dutch people was 3 / 5 of the total number, a total of 3 / 5 * 90 = 54 people. Out of the 54 people who were Dutch, 1 / 2 were Dutch Americans, a total of 1 / 2 * 54 = 27 people. If 1 / 3 of the passengers on the bus identifying as Dutch Americans sat at the windows, their number is 1 / 3 * 27 = 9. The answer is 9.
[Question]Veronica's flashlight was bright enough to be seen at night from a distance of 1000 feet. Freddie's flashlight could be seen at night for a distance three times farther than Veronica's flashlight, and Velma's flashlight could be seen at night from a distance 2000 feet less than 5 times farther than Freddie's flashlight. If Veronica's and Velma's flashlight were placed next to one another and turned on at night, how much farther, in feet, could Velma's flashlight be seen compared to Veronica's?
[Answer]Freddie's flashlight could be seen at night for a distance three times farther than Veronica's flashlight, for a total distance of 3 * 1000 = 3000 feet. Five times farther than the distance from which Freddie's flashlight can be seen at night is 5 * 3000 = 15,000 feet. Velma's flashlight could be seen at night from a distance 2000 feet less than 5 times farther than Freddie's flashlight, for a total distance of 15,000 - 2,000 = 13,000 feet. Compared to Veronica's flashlight, Velma's flashlight could be seen for a distance of 13,000 - 1,000 = 12,000 feet farther. The answer is 12000.
Q: It takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit. If Lydia planted a tree when she was 4 years old and is now 9 years old, how old would she be when she gets to eat an apple from her tree for the first time?
A: The tree has been planted for 9 - 4 = 5 years. It will take another 7 - 5 = 2 years for it to bear fruit. Lydia will be 9 + 2 = 11 years old. The answer is 11.
