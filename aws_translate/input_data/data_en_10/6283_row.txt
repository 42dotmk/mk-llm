Q: Isabella is twice as old as Antonio. In 18 months, she will be 10 years old. How many months old is Antonio?
A: First, we determine that Isabella will be 10 * 12 = 120 months old at age 10, to find a number to compare her age to Antonio's with. Then we subtract the 18 months from the total of 120 months to find 120 - 18 = 102 months, which is the age Isabella is currently. Since at 102 months old Isabella is twice as old as Antonio, we take 102 / 2 = 51 months as Antonio's age. The answer is 51.
Question: During one game, a total of 50 people attended a baseball team’s games. Forty percent and thirty-four percent of the audiences are supporters of the first and second teams, respectively. How many people attended the game did not support either of the teams?
Answer: 50 x 60 / 100 = 30 people support the first team. 50 x 34 / 100 = 17 people support the second team. So, a total of 30 + 17 = 47 people supported the first and second teams. Thus, 50 - 47 = 3 people did not support either team. The answer is 3.
[Question]Billy is breeding mice for an experiment. He starts with 8 mice, who each have 6 pups. When the pups grow up, all the mice have another 6 pups. Then each adult mouse eats 2 of their pups due to the stress of overcrowding. How many mice are left?
[Answer]First find the number of pups in the first generation: 8 mice * 6 pups / mouse = 48 pups. Then add the number of adult mice to find the total number of mice: 48 pups + 8 mice = 56 mice. Then find the number of pups per mouse that survive from the second generation: 6 pups / mouse - 2 pups / mouse = 4 pups / mouse. Then multiply that number by the number of adult mice to find the number of pups in the second generation: 56 mice * 4 pups / mouse = 224 mice. Then add the number of adult mice to the number of second - generation pups to find the total number of mice: 224 mice + 56 mice = 280 mice. The answer is 280.
Q: Twenty people pre-bought plane tickets at a price of $155 per ticket. Thirty people bought their plane tickets at the gate and they each paid $200 for their ticket. How many more dollars did the people at the gate pay for their tickets than those passengers that pre-bought their tickets?
A: Pre - bought: 20 people * $155 = $3100. Gate bought: 30 people * $200 = $6000. $6000 - $3100 = $2900. The passengers that paid at the gate paid $2900 more dollars than those who pre - bought their tickets. The answer is 2900.
Question: Sonia and Joss are moving to their new house at the lake. They have too much stuff in their previous house and decide to make multiple trips to move it all to the new house. They spend 15 minutes filling the car with their stuff and spend 30 minutes driving from the previous house to the new house. Fortunately, they did not waste any time unloading their stuff into the new house. In total they make 6 trips to complete the move. How many hours did they spend moving?
Answer: They spend 15 minutes / trip + 30 minutes / trip = 45 minutes / trip filling the car and driving to the new house. They had to take 6 trips, so they spend 45 minutes / trip x 6 / trip = 270 minutes. They also had to drive back to their previous house 5 times to complete the move: 30 minutes / trip x 5 trips = 150 minutes. In total, they spent 270 minutes + 150 minutes = 420 minutes. Each hour has 60 minutes so they spent 420 minutes ÷ 60 minutes / hour = 7 hours in total. The answer is 7.
