sun was setting in the horizon, bathing the grove in reddish-orange hues as James headed towards it. He navigated his way through the rows of apple trees, their lush greens contrasted with the orange and reds of the setting sun. Finally, he arrived at the orange grove situated on the hillside. The sight that greeted him was magnificent, with countless orange fruits nestling among beautiful green leaves, sparkling in the dusky glow as if thousand lanterns were lit.

James had always been selective about the food he consumed. The apple he had plucked last week was ripe and fresh, yet it held no appeal to him. He had an idiosyncratic belief that the taste of a fruit is somehow connected to when it gets plucked. The apple, for him, carried the taste of last week. Fresh, yes - but old nonetheless. Now, he was yearning for a new taste, a new week - and a newly plucked orange was going to offer him that zest.

His eyes expertly scanned the trees, searching for the ripest and most appealing of the oranges. One tree towards the far end of the grove particularly stood out. The oranges hanging from its branches were the exact color of the sublime sunset, and they were surely the sweetest. The tree was old and wise, its gnarled branches arching down with the weight of delicious sunbeams trapped within the skin of each fruit. He ambled over, deciding to choose an orange from this old, wise creature.

Without delaying any further, James extended his arm upward, fingers extended towards the cluster of oranges hanging tantalisingly just out of his reach. He stepped onto the lowest branch of the tree, the bark rough against his bare feet, but he didn't mind. He went through this ritual every time he picked a fruit, as if paying his respect to the tree which was bestowing upon him its bounty. It was their silent agreement. 

Finally, his fingers made contact with a particularly plump orange, it appeared to be bursting with juice, just asking to be picked. He gently twisted and tugged it from its branch. It came off smoothly, the stalk releasing the orange as if knowing it was time to let go. He held the orange in his hands, its citrusy fragrance wafting up. It was slightly warm from the sun, perfectly ripe, and of this week, void of the staleness of the past. 

He sat down under the tree and started peeling the orange, the rind giving away easily, releasing fresh citrus spritzes into the air. The sections looked juicy and succulent, promising a tangy, sweet flavor. As he bit into the first segment, the juice burst in his mouth, flooding his senses with fresh, tangy sweetness - just the way he wanted. 

Savoring the taste of the orange under the slowly darkening sky, he felt a profound sense of contentment wash over him. The taste of a new week was delicious indeed. His ritual of respecting the trees and picking the freshest fruit somehow brought a certain essence into his life that he cherished.

Just as the last rays of the sun bid adieu to the day, leaving the sky adorned with stars, James stood up. He thanked the tree as he always did and walked back towards his house, feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, and ready to face a brand-new week. The apple of last week was forgotten. Today, he had tasted the orange of a new week. And tomorrow? Who knew which fruit would call to him. But whatever it was, it would be fresh, and it would be of a new day. For in his quest for harvesting the freshest of fruits, James found his way of living a life full of freshness, discarding each day's staleness with the setting sun and welcoming the novelty with the break of dawn.
