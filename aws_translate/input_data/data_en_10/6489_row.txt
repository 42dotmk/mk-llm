Question: A group of hawks is called a kettle. It is breeding season for hawks. A group of ornithologists are tracking 6 kettles of hawks. Each kettle has an average of 15 pregnancies that yield 4 babies per batch. How many babies are expected this season if approximately 25% are lost?
Answer: Each kettle has 15 hawks that get pregnant and each one yields 4 babies per pregnancy so there are 15 * 4 = 60 babies expected per kettle. If 60 baby hawks are expected per kettle and the ornithologists are tracking 6 kettles total then there are 60 * 6 = 360 baby hawks expected across all six kettles this breeding season. If there 25% of eggs do not hatch, then we are looking for 25 (percent that do not make it) / 100 (total number of babies expected) = .25 (percentage converted to decimal form for the proportion of expected baby hawks to be lost). The total number of baby hawks expected equals 360 * .25 expected los s = 90 babies not expected to hatch (lost). There are 360 total number of baby hawks expected and there are 90 babies expected to be lost so 360 - 90 = 270 remaining baby hawks expected this breeding season. The answer is 270.
[Question]Sabina is starting her first year of college that costs $30,000. She has saved $10,000 for her first year. She was awarded a grant that will cover 40% of the remainder of her tuition. How much will Sabina need to apply for to receive a loan that will cover her tuition?
[Answer]The remainder of Sabina’s tuition bill comes to $30,000 - $10,000 = $20,000. The grant will cover $20,000 * 0.40 = $8,000 of her tuition. That means that Sabina will need to apply for a loan of $20,000 - $8,000 = $12,000 to pay for the rest of her tuition. The answer is 12000.

Question: Jill has a difficult test to study for. She decides to study one day for 2 hours. The next day she doubles this amount, and the day after that she studies one hour less than the previous day. How many minutes does Jill study over the 3 days?
Answer: First, we need to determine how many hours Jill studied in total. To find this out, we begin by performing 2 * 2 = 4 hours spent on day two, double what she spent on day 1. Next, we perform 4 - 1 = 3 hours to determine the amount she studied on the third day. We then add 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 hours spent in total across 3 days. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she studied 9 * 60 = 540 minutes in total. The answer is 540.
[Question]Lucy has been trying new recipes and wants to make sure she keeps the cupboard stocked with ingredients. She had a 500g bag of flour in the cupboard at the start of the week. She used 240g when she baked cookies on Tuesday, and accidentally spilled half of what was left when she was putting the flour away. If Lucy wants a full bag of flour in the cupboard, how much flour does she need to buy, in grams?
[Answer]After baking cookies, Lucy had 500 – 240 = 260g of flour left. She accidentally spilled half of this, which means she had 260 * 0.5 = 130g of flour left. She therefore needs 500 – 130 = 370g of flour. The answer is 370.
