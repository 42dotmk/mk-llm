Q: A rancher owns a mixture of 8 sheep and 5 cattle that graze on his land. In a typical year, the rancher will allow his animals to feed off his pastures for as long as possible before they run out of grass. After the pastures run out of grass, he must buy feed corn for $10 per bag. Each cow eats 2 acres of grass per month, and each sheep eats 1 acre of grass per month. Additionally, a bag of feed corn can feed each cow for 1 month and each sheep for 2 months.  If the rancher's pasture contains 144 acres of grass, how much will the rancher need to spend on feed corn to feed his animals each year?
A: First, the 144 acres of grass will be eaten according to the equation 5 * 2 * T + 8 * 1 * T = 144. Solving this equation for T, we find 18 * T = 144, or T = 8 months of food are covered by the animals grazing on the rancher's pasture. This means the farmer must buy feed corn for the remaining 12 - 8 = 4 months. Next, the rancher's 8 sheep will require 4 / 2 = 2 bags of feed corn each, or 8 * 2 = 16 bags of feed corn in total for the 4 month period. The rancher's 5 cows will require 4 / 1 = 4 bags of feed corn each, or 5 * 4 = 20 bags of feed corn in total for the month. Therefore, the rancher needs 16 + 20 = 36 bags of feed corn for all of his animals. So, the rancher will need to spend 36 * 10 = $360 per year on feed corn. The answer is 360.
Question: Greg and Sarah have 18 apples that they are going to split evenly. Susan has twice as many apples as Greg will end up with. Mark has 5 fewer apples than Susan. Their mom needs 40 apples to make an apple pie. How many will she have left over?
Answer: Greg and Sarah will split their apples, so 18 apples / 2 = 9 apples per child. Susan has 2 * 9 apples = 18 apples. Mark has 18 apples - 5 apples = 13 apples. Combined the children have 9 apples + 9 apples + 18 apples + 13 apples = 49 apples. Mom will have 49 apples - 40 apples = 9 apples left over. The answer is 9.
[Question]Amber and Josh are flying to France for vacation. Their flight leaves at 8:00 pm and as an international flight, it's recommended that they check in 2 hours early. It will take 45 minutes to drive to the airport and another 15 minutes to park their vehicle and make their way to the terminal. What is the latest time they can leave their house to make it to the airport in time?
[Answer]It will take 45 minutes to drive to the airport and 15 minutes to park so that's 45 + 15 = 60 minutes (1 hour). They need to check in 2 hours early and it will 1 hour to drive there and park so that's 2 + 1 = 3 hours. Their flight leaves at 8:00 pm and it will take 3 hours to drive there and check in so the latest they can leave is 8 - 3 = 5:00 pm. The answer is 5.
Q: The sum of the ages of three boys is 29. If two of the boys are the same age and the third boy is 11 years old, how old are the other two boys?
A: The third boy is 11 so the sum of the ages of the first two is 29 - 11 = 18. The ages of the first two boys are equal so each of them is 18 / 2 = 9 years. The answer is 9.
Question: A cat spends its time hunting birds. The cat catches 8 birds during the day and twice this many at night. In total, how many birds did the cat catch?
