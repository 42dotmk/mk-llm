The rules of recruitment for All India Services are determined by several institutions and laws that work in collaboration to ensure a fair and efficient process of recruiting officers for various prestigious services, including the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS), and Indian Forest Service (IFoS). The main entities involved in determining these rules are the Indian Constitution, the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), and various service-specific rules and guidelines.

Article 312 of the Indian Constitution defines the All India Services and empowers the Parliament to create new services and modify existing ones. Furthermore, Article 320 provides for the establishment of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), which serves as the central recruiting agency for these services.

2. Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT): The DoPT, under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances, and Pensions, is responsible for formulating policies and managing the recruitment process for the All India Services. The DoPT issues guidelines, rules, and regulations concerning the selection process, training, and cadre allocation for successful candidates.

3. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC): As a constitutional body, UPSC is responsible for conducting examinations and selecting candidates for All India Services. The UPSC is tasked to ensure the selection process is fair, transparent, and merit-based. It formulates examination rules, including eligibility criteria, age limit, educational qualifications, exam pattern, and reservation policies.

4. Service-Specific Rules and Guidelines: Each All India Service has its own specific rules and guidelines, laid down by the concerned Ministry or Department, which govern aspects like probation, seniority, promotion, and cadre allocation. These rules are revised periodically to reflect changes in policy and requirements.

The recruitment process for All India Services consists of the following key stages:

a. Civil Services Examination (CSE): UPSC conducts the CSE annually, which is a three-tier examination consisting of the Preliminary, Main, and Personality Test/Interview. Candidates who qualify the prelims go on to take the mains exams, following which those who clear the cutoff marks are summoned for a personality test or interview.

b. Cadre Allocation: Based on the rank and preference of the candidates, as well as government guidelines on reservation policy, cadre allocation takes place. Candidates are allocated to different states and services like IAS, IPS, and IFoS.

c. Training: Successful candidates undergo an extensive training program, first at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) for a foundation course, followed by specific service-related training at respective academies (e.g., Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy for IPS officers).

d. Probation and Confirmation: After completing their training, officers are posted to various locations on probation. Upon successful completion of the probation period, they are confirmed in their respective services.
