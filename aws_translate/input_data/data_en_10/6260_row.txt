pain was unbearable. The wound, a deep gash and blood oozing all over his arm, needed immediate attention. The trickster god, known for his cunning and agility, knew the injury could end up being an obstacle to his future mischief if not treated correctly. As he searched for a bandage to wrap the nasty cut, he made another split decision based on his history of pain, endurance, and expertise in the healing arts. 

Loki knew the severity of the wound warranted both bandaging and proper disinfection. However, he could not bring himself to use alcohol, as he was afraid the excruciating pain from the stinging sensation would be too much for him to bear. This choice, born from both his trepidation and pride, could potentially lead to serious consequences.

As Loki dressed his wound with the bandage, he thought about the various alternatives he could use to disinfect the wound that might be less agonizing than alcohol. His mind raced through the countless potions, elixirs, and salves he had witnessed his fellow gods using before in similar situations.

A particular memory struck him. Once, when his brother Thor had been injured on the battlefield, a healer had applied a concoction of honey, lavender, and crushed rose petals to the wound. Loki remembered how the beautiful fragrance of the concoction filled the air, and how Thor had reported little to no pain during the healing process, with the wound ultimately healing successfully.

Another option that came across his mind was the use of medicinal mushrooms. In particular, the chaga mushroom, found on birch trees, was known for its potent anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiseptic properties. By making a poultice out of chaga and applying it to his wound, Loki knew that not only could he avoid the sting of alcohol but also harness the powerful healing properties of the mushroom.

Loki weighed both options carefully, considering each one but unsure which one to choose. While the combination of honey, lavender, and rose petals seemed to be an effective and less painful method to heal Thor's wound, it heavily relied on anecdotal evidence. On the other hand, the chaga mushroom had been historically attributed to numerous successful healings and even documented scientific benefits. However, Loki felt that the efficacy of each remedy could be different from person to person, and he found himself hesitant to make a decision.

Contemplating for a few more moments, Loki decided to combine both remedies, hoping the synergistic properties of the unique ingredients would create an effective treatment for his wound. So, he set out on a quest to gather the necessary ingredients: honey, lavender, rose petals, and chaga mushrooms. Once he had obtained them all, Loki lightly crushed the rose petals and mixed them with the honey and lavender. Then, he prepared the chaga poultice by grinding the mushrooms into a paste. He applied the poultice to the wound first, and then gently spread the honey-lavender-and-rose-petal mixture on top, sealing it with the bandage he had already acquired.

While time would tell whether his unorthodox remedy would work, in the end, the combination of ingredients seemed to have a soothing effect, bringing one of the most elusive smiles to Loki's face. It was a smile of relief, of pride, and of anticipation as he looked forward to his swift recovery and scheming of new tricks. Hoping he had made a wise decision to not use alcohol on his wound, Loki couldn't help but imagine the adventures that awaited him once his body had fully healed, ready for a new beginning.
