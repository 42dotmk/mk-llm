Question: Trey is raising money for a new bike that costs $112. He plans to spend the next two weeks selling bracelets for $1 each. On average, how many bracelets does he need to sell each day?
Answer: He needs to sell 112 bracelets because 112 divided by 1 equals 112. He has 14 days to sell bracelets because there are seven days in a week and he has two weeks seven times 2 equals 14. He has to sell 8 bracelets a day because 112 divided by 14 equals 8. The answer is 8.
[Question]A man divides 3 hectares of land evenly among his 8 sons. If every 750m^2 of this land can be used to make a profit of $500 from every 3 months of commercial farming, how much can each son make if they cultivate their share of the land for one year(1 hectare is equal to 10000 m^2)?
[Answer]There are 10000m^2 in each hectare, so 3 hectares contains 3 * 10000 = 30000m^2 of land. 30000m^2 is divided among 8 sons so each son will get 30000 / 8 = 3750m^2. In every 3750m^2, there are 3750 / 750 = 5 portions of 750m^2 areas of land. Each son can make 5 * $500 = $2500 every 3 months from cultivating their share. In one year there are 12 months so each son can make $2500 up to 12 / 3 = 4 times in a year. Each son can make a total of $2500 * 4 = $10000 in a year. The answer is 10000.
Q: An internet provider gives a 5% discount if the customer pays before the 25th day of the month. If the monthly internet rate is $50, how much did the customer pay in all for 4 months if he paid every 25th of the month?
A: The 5% discount amounts to $50 x 5 / 100 = $2.50. So the total discount given to the customer for 4 months was $2.50 x 4 = $10. The customer was supposed to pay $50 x 4 = $200 in all for 4 months without discount. Since the customer is entitled to the discount, then he only paid a total of $200 - $10 = $190 for 4 months. The answer is 190.
Question: In Rodrigo's classroom in the morning there are red chairs, yellow chairs, and blue chairs. There are 4 red chairs. There are 2 times as many yellow chairs as red chairs, and there are 2 fewer blue chairs than yellow chairs. In the afternoon, Lisa borrows 3 chairs. How many chairs are left in Rodrigo's classroom?
Answer: There are 2 * 4 red chairs = 8 yellow chairs. There are 8 yellow chairs - 2 = 6 blue chairs. Total in the morning there were 4 red + 8 yellow + 6 blue = 18 chairs. After Lisa removed chairs there were 18 - 3 chairs = 15 chairs remaining. The answer is 15.
[Question]Dino does some online gig work for a living. He works 20 hours a month making $10 an hour. He works 30 hours a month making $20 an hour. He works 5 hours a month making $40 an hour. He pays $500 a month in expenses. How much money does Dino have left at the end of the month?
[Answer]Dino works 20 hours at a rate of $10 an hour, which means that work pays him 20 * 10 = 200 dollars a month. Dino works 30 hours at a rate of $20 an hour, which means that work pays him 30 * 20 = 600 dollars a month. Dino works 5 hours at a rate of $40 an hour, which means that work pays him 5 * 40 = 200 dollars a month. Altogether, this means Dino makes 200 + 200 + 600 = 1000 dollars a month. You subtract Dino's expenses of 500 from this amount, meaning he has 1000 - 500 = 500 dollars at the end of the month. The answer is 500.
