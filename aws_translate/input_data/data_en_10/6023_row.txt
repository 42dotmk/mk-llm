it had always been her dream. Since they were little girls, Mary and Katrina had shared a deep bond that transcended their cousin relationship. The memories they had built over the years as they played together and grew up side by side were truly precious, and as they grew older, their bond only became stronger.

Mary had been there during Katrina's darkest moments and celebrated her joyous ones as well. Similarly, Katrina had always stood by Mary's side, providing unwavering love and support. When Mary started dating her soon-to-be husband, Jack, Katrina was the first person she shared the news with. Their conversations often ran long into the night, dreamily discussing what the wedding might look like and the roles they would play in the big event.

As the years went by and their dreams neared reality, Mary and Jack's love blossomed, and he eventually proposed to her on a quiet sandy beach under a star-lit sky. With tears in her eyes, she called Katrina right away, eager to share the exciting news. Jumping at the opportunity, Katrina wasted no time in agreeing to be her dear cousin's flower girl.

As the wedding preparations were underway, Mary and Katrina spent countless hours discussing the tiniest details of the big day, from the choice of flowers to the overall theme. Eventually, they settled on a soft, pastel aesthetic with dashes of romantic florals to complement their vision of a garden-inspired wedding. The excitement only grew when it was time to go shopping for the flower girl dress. Katrina's eyes twinkled with joy as she tried on various lovely dresses, her excitement for her important role evident in her every twirl and grin.

Finally, after months of preparation, the big day arrived. The venue was transformed into a beautiful oasis, adorned with vibrant, cascading flowers and delicate pastel accents. In the late afternoon, as soft sunlight filtered through the swaying trees and illuminated the scene, the first guests began to take their seats. The air was filled with warmth, love, and anticipation.

Katrina, now dressed in a charming pastel dress with tiny flowers sewn carefully onto its lace, stood nervously at the end of the aisle. She clutched a small basket filled with rose petals, her hands trembling just slightly. Mary, radiant in her white gown, looked to her with a reassuring smile, conveying all the love and gratitude she felt for her dear cousin on this momentous day.

As the music started, Katrina took a deep breath and began to walk down the aisle, carefully scattering rose petals at her feet. Her cheeks flushed as she stole a glance at the enchanted faces beaming at her from both sides of the aisle. As she reached the altar, she took her place next to Mary and stood proudly, feeling honored to partake in this special moment.

Jack looked at his bride-to-be with immense love, and as the ceremony progressed, the bond between Mary, Jack, and Katrina seemed to be infused with even more warmth and depth. That day, not only did Mary and Jack promise to love and cherish each other for the rest of their lives, but they also acknowledged and celebrated the incredible bond that existed between Mary and Katrina, two souls forever intertwined by love and family.

And from that day on, as they each embarked on new chapters in their lives, Mary, Jack, and Katrina continued to be a source of unending love, support, and inspiration for each other. The joy and fulfillment they brought to one another only grew stronger, proving that their bonds would endure all of life's trials and joys.
