Yes, both questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing - how to pursue an MS program from a top university in the US like MIT or Stanford after completing an undergraduate program in their current institution, though there are some differences in the specific details provided by the askers.

To provide a long, detailed answer that addresses both scenarios, here are the steps to follow:

1. Academic Preparation: First and foremost, maintain a strong academic performance in your undergraduate program (B.E. or B.Tech.). Achieving a high grade point average (GPA) will strengthen your application. As for your major discipline, ensure that it aligns with the field you wish to pursue for your MS degree.

2. Develop a Strong Skill Set: Top American colleges look for candidates with diverse skill sets relevant to their chosen field of study. Do internships, work on projects, learn programming languages if necessary, and engage in research activities to showcase your skills and passion for the subject.

3. Networking: Connect with professors, researchers, and professionals in your field. These connections can lead to research opportunities, internship placements, and strong letters of recommendation for your application. Join clubs and societies related to your field of interest.

4. Research Your Options: Learn about the specific MIT/Stanford/other top American college programs and their admission requirements. Narrow down which specific program you want to apply for and identify the admission timeline.

5. Standardized Tests: Take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) as most US graduate schools require it. A high GRE score can improve your chances of admission. Some programs may also require subject-specific GRE tests or even the TOEFL/IELTS if you are a non-native English speaker, to demonstrate your English language proficiency.

6. Build Your CV/Resume: Highlight your academic achievements, internships, projects, work experience, leadership positions, and any other relevant accomplishments on your CV. Tailor your CV to focus on specific skills or experiences relevant to the MS program you plan to apply for.

7. Letters of Recommendation: Obtain at least two or three strong recommendation letters from professors or employers familiar with your work and potential. Inform them about the specific graduate program you're applying for and how their recommendation can support your application.

8. Statement of Purpose (SOP): Write a compelling and personalized SOP that highlights your background, interests, and future goals in the field you want to pursue. Explain how attending MIT/Stanford/other top American colleges will help you accomplish these objectives.

9. Apply for Scholarships and Financial Aid: Investigate scholarships or financial aid offered by the universities or external funding organizations. Prepare a separate application for scholarships or financial aid if needed, and ensure you are aware of the specific deadlines and eligibility criteria.

10. Submission and Follow-Up: Submit your complete application package on time, including your transcripts, CV, standardized test scores, letters of recommendation, SOP, application fee, and any other required documents. Keep track of your application process and follow up with the universities if necessary.

Lastly, apply to several universities and have a plan in case you don't get accepted into your top choices. Pursuing higher education requires adaptability, persistence, and dedication. By following these steps, you'll improve your chances of getting into a top American college for your MS degree.
