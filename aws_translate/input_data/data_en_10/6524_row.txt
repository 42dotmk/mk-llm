Q: Alexa was on vacation for 3/4ths of the time it took Ethan to learn 12 fencing tricks. Joey spent half as much this time (that Ethan spent learning the tricks) learning to swim. If Alexa spent a week and 2 days on vacation, how many days did it take Joey to learn swimming?
A: There are 7 days in one week so one week and 2 days = 7 + 2 = 9 days. Call the time Ethan spends learning tricks e. Alexa spent 9 days on vacation which is 3 / 4ths of the time Ethan spent learning 12 fencing tricks, hence (3 / 4)e = 9 days. If we multiply both sides of this equation by 4 / 3, we get e = (4 / 3) * 9 days = 12 days. Joey spent half of 12 days which is 12 / 2 = 6 days to learn swimming. The answer is 6.
Question: When doing her exercises, Mairead runs for 40 miles, walks for 3/5 times as many miles as she ran, and walks for five times the number of miles she jogged. Calculate the total distance Mairead has covered while doing her exercises.
Answer: Since the distance that Mairead jogged is 3 / 5 times the miles she ran, she jogged for 3 / 5 * 40 = 24 miles. The total distance that she covered while running and jogging is 24 + 40 = 64. She also walked for 5 * 24 = 120 miles for her exercise. She covered 120 + 64 = 184 miles while doing her exercise. The answer is 184.
[Question]Johnny is a guitar player and he has three colors of guitar picks: red, blue, and yellow. Half of his picks are red, one-third of the picks are blue, and the rest are yellow. If he has 12 blue picks, what is the total number of yellow picks in his collection?
[Answer]If one third (1 / 3) of his picks are blue, then 3 times the total number of blue picks equals his total pick count, or 3 * 12 = 36 picks. If half of the picks are red, then he has 36 / 2 = 18 red picks. If the rest of the picks are yellow, then he has 36 - 18 - 12 = 6 yellow picks. The answer is 6.
Q: Rachel drinks 2 glasses of water on Sunday and 4 glasses of water on Monday. Then she drinks 3 glasses of water every day for the next 4 days. One glass of water is 10 ounces of water. If Rachel wants to drink a total of 220 ounces of water in the week (Sunday to Saturday), how many glasses of water should she drink on Saturday?
A: From Sunday and Monday, Rachel drinks 2 + 4 = 6 glasses of water. From Tuesday to Friday, Rachel drinks 3 * 4 = 12 glasses of water. The total glasses of water she drinks from Sunday to Friday is 6 + 12 = 18 glasses of water. The total ounces of water she drinks from Sunday to Friday is 18 * 10 = 180 ounces. The ounces of water she should drink on Saturday is 220 - 180 = 40 ounces. The glasses of water she should drink on Saturday is 40 / 10 = 4 glasses of water. The answer is 4.
Question: June's mom promises to pay her 1 cent for every cloverleaf she picks from the lawn. June picks 200 clovers in total. 75% have 3 petals. 24% have two petals and 1% have four petals. How many cents does June earn?
Answer: There are 150 clovers with 3 leaves because 200 times .75 equals 150. There are 48 clovers with 2 leaves because 200 times .24 equals 48. There are 2 clovers with 4 leaves because 200 times .01 equals 2. The four - leaf clovers are worth 450 cents because 150 times 3 equals 450. The two leafed clovers are worth 96 cents because 48 times two equals 96. The four - leaf clovers are worth 8 cents because 4 times 2 equals 8. The clovers are worth 554 cents because 450 plus 96 plus 8 equals 554. The answer is 554.
