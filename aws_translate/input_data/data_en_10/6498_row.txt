Q: Paul's grades last semester were very bad. To encourage him, Paul's dad promised him $5 for every B+ he gets in his next scorecard and twice that amount for every A. If Paul obtains at least two A+ he'll double the previous rewards and would receive a flat $15 for every A+ obtained (with no extra bonus). If there are 10 courses with grades in Paul's scorecard, what's the maximum amount he could receive from his dad?
A: We know Paul would get $5 for a B + . However, we know this could be (2x) doubled if he obtains at least two A + . This means 2 * $5 = $10 for a B + if Paul gets at least two A + . We know Paul would get twice the reward of a B + if he gets an A. This means 2 * $5 = $10 for every A. However, we know his reward for every A could be (2x) doubled if he obtains at least two A + . This means 2 * $10 = $20 for every A if Paul gets at least two A + . We learn here then that Paul will get a higher reward for obtaining A grades ($20) than getting A + grades ($15) as long as he's able to score at least two A + . To maximize his payout, Paul will need to get only (2) two A + from his 10 courses. Therefore he should aim to get an A in the remaining 10 - 2 = 8 courses. Assuming Paul can get two A + and eight A in his next scorecard his total payout would be 2 * $15 + 8 * $20. This translates into $30 + $160 or $190. The answer is 190.
Question: Kara mixes cups of sugar and water in the ratio of 1:2 to make one liter of lemonade. Calculate the total number of cups of sugar used if she used 84 cups to make lemonade.
Answer: The total ratio for the cups of sugar and water needed to make lemonade is 1 + 2 = 3. In the 3 cups needed to make one liter of lemonade, the fraction representing the cups of sugar needed is 1 / 3. If she used 84 cups while making lemonade, she used 1 / 3 * 84 = 28 cups of sugar. The answer is 28.
[Question]For homework, Juan's teacher asked everyone in the class, to write down the different types of transportation (cars, trucks, bicycles, skateboards etc) they saw on their way home that afternoon. After school, Juan walked home and saw the following: 15 cars, 3 bicycles, 8 pickup trucks and 1 tricycle. How many tires in total were there on the vehicles Juan saw?
[Answer]He saw 15 cars and 8 trucks so 15 + 8 = 23 vehicles. Those 23 vehicles have 4 wheels each so 23 * 4 = 92 wheels. Bicycles have 2 wheels each and he saw 3 bikes so 2 * 3 = 6 wheels. Tricycles have 3 wheels each and he saw 1 tricycle so 1 * 3 = 3 wheels. In total, Juan saw 92 + 6 + 3 = 101 wheels. The answer is 101.
Q: Marie, the confectioner, makes 12 chocolate eggs, each weighing 10 ounces. She then packs an equal number of the eggs in 4 different gift boxes. Unfortunately, she leaves one of the boxes by the kitchen window and the afternoon sun melts everything. She tosses that box out. What is the total weight, in ounces, of the remaining chocolate eggs?
A: Each gift box has 12 / 4 = 3 chocolate are 12 - 3 = 9 chocolate eggs left. The remaining chocolate eggs therefore weigh 9 * 10 = 90 ounces. The answer is 90.
