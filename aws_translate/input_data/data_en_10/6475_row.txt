The Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) is a financial inclusion program launched by the Government of India and implemented by the Department of Financial Services, Ministry of Finance. The primary aim of this scheme is to provide affordable access to financial services to the unbanked and underprivileged sections of Indian society. These services include bank accounts, credit, insurance, and pension facilities. PMJDY was launched by the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Damodardas Modi, on August 28, 2014. This program is a crucial part of the government's policy framework to foster inclusive growth and ensure social security for all citizens.

Narendra Damodardas Modi is an Indian politician who has served as the 14th Prime Minister of India since 2014. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Prior to his tenure as Prime Minister, Modi held various positions in politics, both at the state and national levels.

Narendra Modi's political career began in the 1970s when he joined the RSS, a right-wing Hindu nationalist organization, as a full-time worker. In the 1980s, Modi held various positions within the BJP, including General Secretary for the party in Gujarat, his home state. His leadership roles within the BJP led him to be appointed the Chief Minister of Gujarat in October 2001, following the resignation of his predecessor, Keshubhai Patel.

Modi gained national prominence during his time as Chief Minister of Gujarat. From 2001 to 2014, Modi implemented several economic reforms, infrastructure development projects, and social welfare schemes aimed at improving the standard of living for the people of Gujarat. His administration faced controversy, however, particularly related to the 2002 Gujarat riots and alleged human rights abuses during his tenure. Nevertheless, Modi successfully led the BJP to three consecutive electoral victories in Gujarat, and his leadership was instrumental in consolidating the party's position both at the state and national levels.

In 2014, Narendra Modi was appointed the Prime Ministerial candidate for the BJP in the Indian General elections. He successfully led his party to a landslide victory, securing a majority for the BJP in the Indian Parliament, a feat only achieved a few times in the history of Indian politics. Modi's charismatic leadership and reputation for effective governance helped the BJP expand its voter base across India.

As Prime Minister, Modi has implemented various economic and social policies, aimed at promoting financial inclusion, improving infrastructure, and fostering a more business-friendly environment in India. One of the flagship programs during his tenure has been the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana, which has played a pivotal role in helping the unbanked population gain access to basic financial services. This program has been widely recognized for its impact on poverty alleviation and financial inclusion in the country.

In conclusion, the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana and Narendra Damodardas Modi have served in politics through their efforts in promoting financial inclusion, economic growth, and social welfare in India. PMJDY has become a crucial component of Modi's policy framework in his capacity as Prime Minister, while Modi's political career has spanned various roles from grassroots activism to the highest office in the Indian Government. Their combined efforts in these areas have made a significant impact on the lives of millions of Indians and have contributed to shaping the nation's trajectory in the 21st century.
