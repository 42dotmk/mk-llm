[Question]My cat's empty bowl weighs 420 grams. If I give my cat 60 grams per day and I always fill her bowl every 3 days, how much does her bowl weigh if after I ended up refilling her empty bowl she only ate 14 grams?
[Answer]If I give my cat 60 grams per day and I fill it to last 3 days, then I put a total of 60 * 3 = 180 grams into her bowl. If the empty bowl weighs 420 grams and I put 180 grams the total weight is = 420 + 180 = 600 grams. If my cat only ate 14 grams then the bowl right now weighs 600 - 14 = 586 grams. The answer is 586.

Question: A class is completing an art project. Each of the 30 students is assigned to a separate group and will need to take markers from the 22 boxes of markers. The first group has 10 students who will have 2 markers each and the second group has 15 students who will have 4 markers each. The last group takes the remaining markers and divides them equally. If each box of markers contains 5 markers, how many markers does each of the students in the last group receive?
Answer: The first group uses a total of 10 students * 2 markers = 20 markers. The second group uses a total of 15 students * 4 markers = 60 markers. This is a total of 20 + 60 = 80 markers. The total number of markers in the boxes is 5 markers * 22 boxes = 110 markers. This leaves 110 – 80 = 30 markers for the last group to split between themselves. The last group is made up of 30 total students – 10 students in the first group – 15 students in the second group = 5 students. Therefore, students in the last group receive 30 markers / 5 students = 6 markers each. The answer is 6.
[Question]Camille goes to the Ice Cream Palace with her husband and two children. Each one orders a different ice cream. Camille orders a banana split, her husband orders a waffle bowl, her daughter orders a single cone, and her son orders a double cone. The cone has 1 scoop of ice cream, the banana split has 3 times as many scoops of ice cream as the cone and the waffle bowl has 1 more scoop than the banana split. How many scoops of ice cream did the ice cream man serve?
[Answer]The double cone has 2 * 1 = 2 scoops of ice cream. The banana split has three times as many scoops of ice cream as the single cone, so it has 3 * 1 = 3 scoops of ice cream. The waffle bowl has 1 more scoop of ice cream than the banana split, so it has 3 + 1 = 4 scoops of ice cream. The ice cream man served a total of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 scoops of ice cream. The answer is 10.
