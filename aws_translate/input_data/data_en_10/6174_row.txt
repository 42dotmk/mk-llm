Question: Susan is making jewelry with a repeating pattern that has 3 green beads, 5 purple beads, and twice as many red beads as green beads. If the pattern repeats three times per bracelet and 5 times per necklace, how many beads does she need to make 1 bracelets and 10 necklaces?
Answer: First find the number of red beads per repeat: 3 green * 2 red / green = 6 red. Then add the number of beads of each color to find the total number of bead per repeat: 6 beads + 3 beads + 5 beads = 14 beads. Then multiply the number of beads per repeat by the number of repeats per bracelet to find the number of beads per bracelet: 14 beads / repeat * 3 repeats / bracelet = 42 beads / bracelet. Then multiply the number of beads per repeat by the number of repeats per necklace to find the number of beads per necklace: 14 beads / repeat * 5 repeats / necklace = 70 beads / necklace. Then multiply the number of beads per necklace by the number of necklaces to find the total number of beads used in the necklaces: 70 beads / necklace * 10 necklaces = 700 beads. Then add the number of beads used in a bracelet to the number of beads in the necklaces to find the total number of beads used: 700 beads + 42 beads = 742 beads. The answer is 742.
[Question]Kelly booked a three week vacation to visit relatives. The first day, she spent traveling. The next 5 days she spent at her Grandparents' house. The next day, she spent traveling. Then, she spends the next 5 days at her brother's house. Then she spent two days traveling to her sister's house, spent several days at her sister's house, and then spent two more days traveling home. How many days did she spend at her sister's house?

She traveled one day to her grandparents' house, one day to her brother's house, two days to her sister's house, and two days back home for a total of 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 days. She spent 5 days at her grandparents' house and 5 days at her brother's house, for a total of 5 + 5 = 10 days. Thus, of the 21 vacation days, the number of days remaining to spend with her sister was 21 - 6 - 10 = 5 days. The answer is 5.
