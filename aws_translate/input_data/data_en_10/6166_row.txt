Timothy F. Geithner is already written in English, but let me provide you with a detailed background about him.

Timothy Franz Geithner (born August 18, 1961) is an American financial expert and economic policy-maker who was the 75th United States Secretary of the Treasury, serving from January 2009 to January 2013. He worked closely with then-President Barack Obama and led the economic team that navigated the United States through challenging times, such as the global financial crisis.

Geithner was born in Brooklyn, New York, but spent much of his childhood traveling and living in different countries due to his father's work. He attended several international schools, which exposed him to a diverse range of cultures and ideas. He would later use these experiences to inform his approach to international economic policy.

Geithner studied at Dartmouth College, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in government and Asian studies in 1983. He then obtained a Master of Arts in international economics and East Asian studies from the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University in 1985. His academic background focused on both economics and international relations.

After completing his education, Geithner joined the Treasury Department in 1988. He held various roles, including the Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Monetary and Financial Policy, Senior Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Affairs, Assistant Secretary for International Affairs, and Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs. In these roles, he was involved in policy formulation and implementation, particularly related to international trade, financial regulation, and crisis response initiatives.

In 2001, Geithner left the Treasury Department and joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as Director of the Policy Development and Review Department. In this position, he tackled financial crises impacting developing nations and helped craft policies to improve global economic stability.

Geithner's tenure as the ninth President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began in November 2003, where he played a leading role in designing and implementing the Central Bank's response to the financial crisis that began in 2007. In this role, he became well-acquainted with both the public and private sides of the financial system, which enabled him to identify potential vulnerabilities and work towards devising solutions.

In January 2009, Timothy F. Geithner was sworn in as the 75th Secretary of the Treasury. As part of President Obama's economic team, Geithner led the government's efforts to restore stability to financial markets, address the housing crisis, and assist the auto industry in transitioning to a more sustainable future. He also played a key role in the design and implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which aimed to prevent future financial crises.

Following his tenure as Treasury Secretary, Geithner has continued to contribute to the world of finance, policy, and international relations in various roles, including becoming President of Warburg Pincus, a private equity firm, in 2014.

In summary, Timothy F. Geithner is a highly accomplished economic policy-maker whose career has encompassed roles in academia, government, and the private sector. His expertise in international economics and financial regulation has positioned him as a key figure in shaping and implementing policies that have had enduring effects on the U.S. and global economy.
