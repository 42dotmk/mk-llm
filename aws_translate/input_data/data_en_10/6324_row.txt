2. Its cost. The 2019 Indian general election is the second most expensive election in the world, with around $7 billion being spent during the electoral process. The figure is second only to the $7 billion spent in the 2012 United States presidential race, the world's most expensive election. The high cost of the Indian elections can be attributed to the massive scale, extensive campaigning, advertising, and logistics that are necessary to facilitate the voting process across the country.

3. Key political parties. The two main political parties in India are the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The INC, which is led by Rahul Gandhi, has historically played a central role in Indian politics. The BJP, on the other hand, is led by incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and has gained popularity over the past decade, particularly among the middle class and urban populations.

4. Coalition politics. It is common for political parties in India to form coalitions in order to gain a majority in the Lok Sabha. Currently, the ruling alliance is the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by the BJP, while the main opposition alliance is the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) led by the INC.

5. Key issues. The primary issues in this election include job creation, economic growth, national security, and women's safety. Both the ruling BJP and the opposition INC have laid out their respective agendas and outlined their plans to address these critical areas.

6. Digital campaigning. Given the increasing importance of social media and digital platforms, both major parties have invested significantly in online advertising and communication strategies. This has led to a surge in the use of platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp for political messaging and engagement with the electorate.

7. Security concerns. Ensuring the safety of voters and election officials during the five-week voting period remains a significant challenge for Indian authorities. Thousands of security forces have been deployed across the country to maintain law and order and to prevent any disturbances.

8. Voting process. India uses electronic voting machines (EVMs) to record votes. This technology has been in use since 1999 and has been praised for its efficiency and accuracy. However, concerns about the possibility of tampering have arisen on occasion. In response, Indian authorities have introduced the Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT), which allows voters to verify their votes on a printed slip before it is stored in a sealed container.

9. International observers. As in previous years, the Indian general election has attracted the attention of election observers from various countries and international organizations. These observers monitor the electoral process to ensure that it is free, fair, and transparent.

10. Potential outcomes. Analysts predict that the BJP and its NDA coalition partners may win a majority of seats, enabling Narendra Modi to continue as Prime Minister. However, a strong performance by the INC and the UPA coalition cannot be ruled out, potentially leading to a negotiated outcome and the formation of a new government.

11. Impact on India's future. The outcome of the 2019 Indian general election will have significant implications for the country's domestic and foreign policies, as well as its economy. The new government's approach to issues such as job creation, economic growth, national security, and women's safety will be of critical importance in shaping India's future in the coming years.
