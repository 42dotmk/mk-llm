No, these two questions have different meanings and ask for distinct information on Greek, Roman, and Norse gods. Let's look at both questions separately:

1. What are the last names of Greek, Roman, and Norse gods?

This question is asking for the last names or surnames associated with deities from three different mythological pantheons: Greek, Roman, and Norse. However, it is important to clarify that gods and goddesses in ancient mythologies generally did not have last names like we do today.

For context, here is a brief overview of some major gods and goddesses from each pantheon:

Greek mythology:
- Zeus: King of the gods and god of the sky, lightning, and thunder
- Hera: Queen of the gods and goddess of marriage, family, and childbirth
- Poseidon: God of the sea, earthquakes, and horses

Roman mythology:
- Jupiter: King of the gods and god of the sky, thunder, and lightning
- Juno: Queen of the gods and goddess of marriage, childbirth, and family
- Neptune: God of the sea, earthquakes, and horses

Norse mythology:
- Odin: The All-Father, chief of the Aesir, and god of wisdom, war, and poetry
- Thor: God of thunder, lightning, storms, and strength
- Freyja: Goddess of love, beauty, fertility, and war

In mythology, one might argue that gods and goddesses have epithets rather than last names. Epithets are descriptive phrases or terms given to deities to describe their attributes, actions, or roles within their mythology and religion. For example, Zeus is referred to as "Zeus Olympios" (Zeus of Olympus) or "Zeus Xenios" (Zeus of hospitality). These epithets provide a form of identification and characteristics, but they are not last names.

2. What happened to Greek, Roman, and Norse gods?

This question is seeking information about the historical and cultural development of these three mythological pantheons as well as their influence and transformation over time.

Greek gods: The Greek gods were widely worshipped and followed by the ancient Greeks. As time passed and Christianity spread, the influence of Greek gods began to fade. During the Roman Empire, Greek gods were often incorporated into Roman culture and adopted new identities and characteristics. Ultimately, as Roman polytheism declined and Christianity gained prominence, worship and belief in Greek gods diminished further.

Roman gods: Initially, the Romans had their gods and followed the traditional beliefs of their ancestors. As the Roman Empire expanded and came into contact with Greek civilization, they adopted many of the Greek deities, attributing Roman names and identities to them. The rise of Christianity and the eventual adoption of Christianity as the state religion by Emperor Constantine I in the early 4th century AD led to the decline of Roman polytheism.

Norse gods: The Norse gods were integral to the religious practices and beliefs of the ancient Norse people. As various Northern European regions, such as Scandinavia and other regions inhabited by Germanic tribes, came into contact with Christianity, conversion began to take place. By the end of the Viking Age (around 11th century AD) and the continued spread of Christianity, Norse polytheism saw a decline, and worship and belief in Norse gods dissipated and became part of folklore, legends, and stories.

In summary, while the two questions are related to Greek, Roman, and Norse deities, they are indeed asking for different information. The first question focuses on identifying the last names of these gods, whereas the second question seeks historical context on the evolution and decline of these mythological pantheons.
