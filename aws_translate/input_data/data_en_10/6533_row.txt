While these questions may seem similar due to their focus on communication platforms and the blocking feature, they are asking about two distinct applications, WeChat and Facebook Messenger, and are not exactly the same. They ask about similar functionality in each respective app, but the answers are tailored specifically to each application, and the processes and indications of being blocked might vary between the two platforms.

The first question is asking, "How do I know if someone has blocked me on WeChat?" This centers on WeChat, which is a popular Chinese messaging app used for messaging, calling, and social media. Here is a detailed answer for this question:

1. Check their Moments: WeChat Moments is a feature that works similarly to Facebook's timeline. If you cannot see any new posts from that person or their existing posts have disappeared, it could be an indication that they have blocked you.

2. Send a message: If you send a message and it remains stuck at "Sent" instead of changing to "Delivered," it might be a sign that you have been blocked by the user.

3. Search for the user: If you try searching for the person's name, and you can't find them in the search results, they may have blocked you.

4. WeChat Sticker Shop: Visit the WeChat Sticker Shop and choose any set of free stickers. If there's an option to "Gift" the stickers to someone, search for the person in question. If they are not listed, it could mean they have blocked you.

Please note, though, that these observations could be due to other reasons, such as a deactivated account, privacy settings, or network issues. It is important to consider these alternative explanations before concluding that you have been blocked.

The second question is asking, "How can you tell if you've been blocked on Facebook Messenger?" This question is about Facebook Messenger and has a completely separate set of variables and signs to consider. Here is a detailed answer for this question:

1. Check for the contact’s profile picture and “Last Active” status: If you can no longer see the profile picture or the "Last Active" status of the person you suspect has blocked you, this could be an indication of being blocked.

2. Send a message: If your message doesn't get delivered, and you only see a gray checkmark (indicating "Sent"), it could mean that you have been blocked. This is not always definitive, as it might also indicate network issues or the recipient has turned off their chat feature.

3. Your call won't go through: If you attempt to call the person via Messenger, and it doesn't connect or the call is not answered, it might be a sign that you have been blocked.

4. Mutual group messages: If you share a group message with the person, you can check if you're able to view their messages in the group chat. If you cannot see their messages, it might be an indication they have blocked you.

5. Search for them on Facebook: If you are unable to find them in your friends list or through a Facebook search, it could mean that you have been blocked or they have deleted their account.

Again, it is essential to consider alternative explanations such as privacy settings, deactivated accounts, or network issues before concluding that you have been blocked based on these signs.

In conclusion, while both questions are about identifying whether you've been blocked on communication platforms, they specifically ask about the signs and methods for two different apps: WeChat and Facebook Messenger. The processes and indications for each application may vary, so it's necessary to treat them as separate queries.
