Mitty, he delivers a subtle performance of a man deeply embedded within his own imagination, a man so captivated by his fantasies that his real-world existence feels like an afterthought. This dichotomy is well realized in Mitty's thought-provoked escapades, magically enhanced by the power of CGI, which provides him the technicolor canvas to paint his adventures onto. Yet, with every beautifully crafted scene, each cinematically enchanting frame, one can’t help but feel a craving for a richer emotional context—a glimpse into the core of this delightful daydreamer.

Stiller's interpretation of Mitty is understated, often buried under the grandiosity of his extravagant dreams. His performance manages to tread this intricate balance of subdued reality against the tsunami of his imaginings, graduating away from the tried formulas of over-the-top physical comedy—that Stiller being previously known for—to a more introspective type. However, this introspection, this insight into Mitty's inner life, feels oddly missing beneath the overwhelming visual spectacle.

In his previous roles, Stiller has proven his adeptness at showcasing distressing emotional conflicts effectively. But here, in "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," there’s a disconnect. The focus appears to be more on the breathtakingly vivid visuals, and less on the emotional gravity of Mitty's life — a point where fantasy and reality collide. This is a stark contrast to James Thurber's original work, in which the protagonist’s vibrant imagination is merely an escape, a survival mechanism against the dull drudgery of his life.

Despite "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" boasting stunning digital sequences as Mitty drifts between reality and fantasy, there’s an unfulfilled emotional core—evidenced by the film's inability to locate and really showcase the 'beating heart' of its eponymous hero. Mitty, despite having his dreams come alive in an astounding digital display, seems a tad one-dimensional, incapable of evoking generating adequate empathy. 

Stiller's transition from slapstick comedy to more humorously heartbreaking roles has been well received in the past. But the lack of depth in his portrayal of Mitty—despite the cinematic spectacle that surrounds the character—leaves the audience wanting. Ultimately, despite the film's razzmatazz, it struggles to genuinely connect with its hero's emotional core, a necessity in order to truly empathize and resonate with the joys, fears, and frustrations of Walter Mitty. 

The story's original author, James Thurber, masterfully portrayed a protagonist with a vivid imagination as a counterpoint to his mundane existence. But in this rendition, the audience gets caught up in the awe-inspiring visuals while the emotional subtlety of the character that should underpin the narrative gets lost. While Stiller’s Mitty is certainly strengthened with the introduction of digital spectacle, his emotional presence is what seems to be entrapped in the celluloid. The viewer remains emotionally detached from the protagonist and his situation. 

In the end, although Stiller’s performance alongside the spectacular visual effects certainly brings life to the screen, this stylization seems to fail where it matters the most: in making us feel for the character and understanding his emotional world. Despite its potential, "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" pivots more on the dazzling spectacle than on the protagonist's emotional journey, thereby missing the mark on truly exploring the depths of the main character's secret life.
