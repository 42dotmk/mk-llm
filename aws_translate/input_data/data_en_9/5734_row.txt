Alan Bean was an American astronaut, test pilot, and aeronautical engineer who played a significant role in the mission Apollo 12, the sixth manned flight in NASA's Apollo program. Born on March 15, 1932, in Wheeler, Texas, Bean graduated from the University of Texas with a degree in Aeronautical Engineering in 1955. He then joined the U.S. Navy, and upon completion of his training, served as a test pilot and flight instructor. Bean was selected as an astronaut by NASA in 1963, as part of Astronaut Group 3.

Apollo 12 was the second manned mission that successfully landed on the moon, following the historic Apollo 11 mission. Launched on November 14, 1969, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Apollo 12's primary goal was to carry out extensive scientific experiments and exploration of the lunar surface. The mission was commanded by veteran astronaut Charles "Pete" Conrad, with Alan Bean serving as Lunar Module Pilot and Richard F. Gordon Jr. as Command Module Pilot.

The Apollo 12 mission had three major components: the Command Module (CM) "Yankee Clipper," the Lunar Module (LM) "Intrepid," and the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV). The CM was a cone-shaped craft used to transport the astronauts between the Earth and lunar orbit. The LM was designed to transport two astronauts from the CM to the moon's surface and back. The LRV was a small electric vehicle that was used for the first time on the Apollo 15 mission; however, Apollo 12 astronauts used a handcart to transport their scientific instruments and lunar rock samples.

Upon reaching the lunar orbit, Gordon remained in the CM, while Conrad and Bean descended to the lunar surface on the LM "Intrepid." Apollo 12's landing site was the Ocean of Storms, near the Surveyor 3 spacecraft, which had landed on the moon in April 1967. The primary objectives of the mission were to retrieve the Surveyor 3 camera, collect rock samples, deploy scientific instruments, and conduct experiments.

During their stay on the lunar surface, which lasted approximately 32 hours, Conrad and Bean carried out two extravehicular activities (EVAs) or moonwalks, with a total duration of nearly eight hours. They deployed the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP), a set of scientific instruments, to measure seismic activity, lunar atmosphere, and solar wind. The astronauts collected over 75 pounds (34 kilograms) of lunar rock and soil samples, including parts of Surveyor 3, which provided valuable insights into the moon's geological history and the effects of long-term exposure to the lunar environment.

Apollo 12's return journey to Earth began on November 20, 1969, with the LM's ascent stage lifting off from the moon's surface. The ascent stage docked with the waiting CM, where Conrad, Bean, and Gordon prepared for their voyage back to Earth. They splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on November 24, 1969, successfully concluding the mission.

The Apollo 12 mission played a vital role in advancing our understanding of the moon and in paving the way for future manned lunar missions. Alan Bean's contribution as an astronaut and Lunar Module Pilot was critical to the success of the mission. Apart from his career as an astronaut, Alan Bean was also an accomplished artist, renowned for his paintings depicting human space exploration and the Apollo missions. Bean passed away on May 26, 2018, at the age of 86, leaving behind a legacy of exploration and inspiration that will continue to inspire future generations of astronauts and space enthusiasts.
