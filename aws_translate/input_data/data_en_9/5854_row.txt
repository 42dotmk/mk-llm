The goal "hands" is quite ambiguous. It could either mean obtaining an object that resembles hands or improving one's hand skills. I will be providing a detailed plan of action for both interpretations below.

1. Obtaining an object that resembles hands:
A) Identifying the purpose
- Determine the function of these hands (for example, are they for a robotic arm, prosthetic device, or just a decorative item?)
- Understand the required features (Should they be fully functional, or do they just need to be aesthetically pleasing?)

B) Research
- Look up information on appropriate materials, mechanisms, and technologies that cater to the functions outlined earlier.
- Compare various designs, identify pros and cons, and read user reviews if available.
- Estimate the cost of the intended project.

C) Acquisition
- There are three main ways to acquire the desired hands: purchase, DIY, or 3D printing.
  i) Purchase: Find reliable vendors or manufacturers who sell the desired hands following the specifications and budget.
  ii) DIY: Gather necessary materials, tools, and components. Learn how to assemble the parts through tutorials, workshops, or online resources. 
  iii) 3D printing: Seek out 3D printing services or buy a 3D printer to create the hands. Find or create an appropriate design file for the 3D model, acquire the necessary printing materials and follow the given guidelines for printing.

D) Assembly and Integration
- Assemble the hands, following any necessary documentation or tutorial videos.
- Integrate the obtained hands with the intended system (robotic arm, prosthetic, etc.)
- Perform preliminary tests to ensure both aesthetics and functionality.

E) Maintenance
- Keep a record of any wear and tear or breakdowns.
- Schedule regular maintenance to ensure longevity and functionality.
- Replace or repair any broken or worn-out components as needed.


2. Improving one's hand skills:
A) Identify Hand Skills
- Determine which specific hand skills need improvement, such as dexterity, strength, coordination.

B) Set Specific Objectives
- Establish clear goals for each identified skill, such as “I want to improve my hand's strength to lift a certain weight” or “I want to improve my dexterity for playing piano.”

C) Research Exercises and Techniques
- Look up exercises that target specific hand muscles to improve strength, dexterity, and coordination.
- Investigate ergonomics and grasp techniques appropriate for the desired skills.
- Look into therapies and rehabilitation programs designed to improve hand function.

D) Create a Training Plan
- Draft a comprehensive schedule that includes the researched exercises and techniques.
- Set aside dedicated practice time every day/week to ensure consistency and effectiveness.

E) Track Progress and Modify
- Monitor progress regularly using objective measurements, such as the ease of performing targeted tasks, lifting weights, or playing musical instruments.
- Modify the training plan based on the achieved progress, incorporating new exercises, techniques or increasing practice time if necessary.

F) Seek Professional Assistance
- If progress is slow or stagnant, consider seeking guidance from professionals such as occupational therapists, physical therapists, or specialized trainers.
- These experts can help identify roadblocks and recommend customized solutions tailored to individual needs.

By following these plans of action for either interpretation of the goal "hands," you will be well on your way to accomplishing your desired objective.
