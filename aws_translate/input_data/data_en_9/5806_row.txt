Plato (c. 428-348 BCE), the ancient Greek philosopher, was the most prominent figure who believed that only philosophers should run the government. This belief was central to his political philosophy, as evident in his famous work, "The Republic."

Plato's arguments on the ideal government began as a response to the political turmoil and moral decline of Athenian society during his lifetime. He sought to establish a government that would be ethical, wise, and just. Plato argued that a well-ordered, harmonious society could only be achieved if it were governed by individuals who had a deep understanding of abstract concepts like justice, goodness, and beauty. He believed that only philosophers possessed the necessary intellectual capacity and moral disposition to attain such an understanding.

In "The Republic," Plato introduces the idea of the Philosopher-King, ruling over his imagined utopian society called Kallipolis. He asserts that in order to create a just society, the rulers must be philosophers, as they possess knowledge of the Forms (ideal essences of things). Philosophers, in Plato's view, are those who love wisdom and have a desire for truth. They have the ability to see the "big picture," which is crucial for enabling them to make moral, ethical, and rational decisions for the common good.

According to Plato, philosopher-kings would be able to create and maintain a just society because they are guided by wisdom and rationality, rather than by personal or financial interests. They value knowledge and understand the true nature of reality, allowing them to make better-informed decisions that benefit the entire community. Furthermore, since philosopher-kings have no personal desires or motives, they would be less likely to become corrupt.

Platoâ€™s concept of the philosopher-king revolves around his Theory of Forms, which includes the notion that reality consists of two realms: the visible world of particulars, which we perceive with our senses, and the unchanging, eternal world of the Forms. It is the knowledge of the Forms that philosophers possess and the ordinary people lack.

In the education system of Kallipolis, potential philosopher-kings would undergo a rigorous and extensive educational program, which would involve both intellectual and physical training. This program would ultimately serve to develop the philosopher's mind and character. Notably, the educational curriculum included subjects like mathematics, astronomy, dialectics, and physical education. After completing their education, the philosopher-kings would apply their acquired wisdom and leadership skills to govern society fairly and effectively.

Although Plato's idea of philosophers running the government has been influential in the history of political thought, it has also been criticized. Critics argue that it is impractical and elitist, as it assumes that philosophers would be somehow immune to corruption and that their rule would be inherently superior. Additionally, there are concerns regarding the lack of representation and democratic values in such a system.

In conclusion, it was Plato who believed that only philosophers should run the government, as they possessed the wisdom, intellectual capacity, and moral disposition required for effective and just governance. His ideal government, as portrayed in "The Republic," is centered around the philosopher-king who would cultivate a harmonious and morally upright society, free from the instability and failings of its contemporaneous reality.
