Q: Lilith is trying to break the world record for largest cap collection. She collects 3 caps per month in the first year, and 5 caps per month after the first year. Each Christmas, she also receives 40 caps from friends and family. She estimates that each year, she loses 15 of the caps she has collected. If Lilith has been collecting for 5 years, how many caps has she collected so far?
A: In the first year, Lilith collects 3 caps * 12 months = 36 caps. Every year afterwards, she collects 5 caps * 12 months = 60 caps. She does this for a total of 5 – 1 = 4 years. This is a total of 60 caps * 4 years = 240 caps. In total, she collects 36 + 240 = 276 caps by herself. Over the Christmases, she receives 40 caps * 5 years = 200 caps from friends and family. She also loses 15 caps * 5 years = 75 caps over the years. She has therefore collected 276 + 200 – 75 = 401 caps. The answer is 401.
Question: Mark builds an apartment that is 16 by 10 feet. There are 6 rooms in total. All the rooms are the same size except the living room which is as big as 3 other rooms. How big is the living room?
Answer: Total square footage is 16 * 10 = 160 square feet. . There are 3 + 3 = 6 rooms. 6 - 1 = 5 of them are the same size. If x is the size of the normal room then the square footage of all rooms is 5x + 3x = 8x. So each room is 160 / 8 = 20 square feet. So the living room is 20 * 3 = 60 square feet. The answer is 60.
[Question]Cornelia likes to travel. She visited already 42 different countries. 20 of them were in Europe and 10 in South America. From the rest of the countries, only half of them were in Asia. How many Asian countries has Cornelia visited?
[Answer]Cornelia visited 42 countries - 20 countries - 10 countries = 12 countries which were outside of Europe and South America. Half of those 12 countries were in Asia, so there were 12 countries / 2 = 6 Asian countries that Cornelia visited. The answer is 6.
Q: John gets a bonus that's the same percentage every year. Last year he made $100,000 and got a $10,000 bonus. This year he makes $200,000. How much will John make this year when adding both his total pay and bonus together?
A: First we need to determine the bonus percentage, which is found by dividing the bonus amount by the amount John made for the year, taking 10,000 / 100,000 = .10, or 10 percent. Then, we take John's earnings from this year and multiply them by the same percentage, taking 200,000 * .1 = 20,000 dollars in bonuses. We then add these two numbers together, for a total of 200,000 + 20,000 = 220,000 dollars. The answer is 220000.
Question: Porter is a painter who creates beautiful paintings of wild animals. Most recently, he painted a mural of a pack of wolves standing on a snowy-white mountainside underneath a full moon. He put the painting up for auction and it sold for $1000 less than five times more than he had made on his previous painting. If he received $44,000 for the sale of his most recent painting, how much, in dollars, did he make for selling his previous painting?
Answer: If $44,000 is $1000 less than five times more than he had made on his previous painting, then $44,000 + $1000 = $45,000 is five times what he made on his previous painting. If $45,000 is five times what he made for his previous painting, then he made $45,000 / 5 = $9,000 for selling his previous painting. The answer is 9000.
