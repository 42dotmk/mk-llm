Many German epic poems and prose works were written by various authors throughout history, contributing to the rich and diverse German literary tradition. Some of the most prominent authors, their works, and their contributions to German literature are as follows:

1. Wolfram von Eschenbach (c. 1170 - c. 1220): A German knight and poet, Wolfram is best known for his epic poem "Parzival," which tells the story of the titular character's quest to become a knight of the Round Table and his journey to find the Holy Grail. Wolfram's narrative, moral complexities, and rich imagery within the poem had a significant impact on German literature.

2. Gottfried von Strassburg (c. 1210): A key figure in the development of courtly romance, Gottfried is the author of "Tristan," a seminal Middle High German literary work. The poem tells the tragic story of Tristan and Isolde's forbidden love and is considered one of the great accomplishments of medieval German literature.

3. The Nibelungenlied (c. 1200): This anonymous Middle High German epic poem tells the story of Siegfried, Kriemhild, and the royal family of Burgundy. The Nibelungenlied is divided into two parts; the first part deals with Siegfried's life and his marriage to Kriemhild and the second part concerns Kriemhild's revenge on those responsible for Siegfried's death. The Nibelungenlied is a cornerstone of German literature and has often been compared to the works of Homer.

4. Hartmann von Aue (c. 1160 - c. 1210): A poet and minnesinger, Hartmann von Aue penned several significant works in Middle High German literature, including the courtly romance "Erec" and the Arthurian epic poem "Iwein." His works paved the way for the emergence of the courtly romance genre in German literature.

5. Walther von der Vogelweide (c. 1170 - c. 1230): One of the most exceptional poets and minnesingers of the Middle Ages, Walther von der Vogelweide wrote in both Middle High German and Middle Low German. His works include love songs, political poems, religious lyric poetry, and the epic poem "Reichston." Walther's poetry strongly impacted subsequent generations of poets and defined the courtly love tradition in German literature.

6. Heinrich von Veldeke (c. 1150 - c. 1190): A pioneering poet in the world of Middle High German literature, Heinrich von Veldeke elevated the art of courtly love poetry and contributed to the development of the chivalric romance with his work "Eneasroman," a retelling and reimagining of the story of Aeneas from Virgil's "Aeneid."

7. Thomas Mann (1875 - 1955): A German writer and one of the most compelling figures in 20th-century literature, Mann's novels and short stories delve into the challenges of modernity and the human condition. Works such as "Buddenbrooks," "The Magic Mountain," and "Doctor Faustus" showcase his exceptional literary talent and affinity for creating complex, engaging narratives.

8. Hermann Hesse (1877 - 1962): A German-born Swiss poet, painter, and novelist, Hesse is best known for works like "Siddhartha," "Steppenwolf," "Demian," and "The Glass Bead Game," which explore themes of self-discovery, spirituality, and the challenges of modern life. Hesse's impact on German literature and his exploration of human psychology earned him the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1946.
