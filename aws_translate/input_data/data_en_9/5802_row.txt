Question: Passage: The franchise was poor to mediocre in the eight years before moving to New Jersey, a pattern that continued during the first five years in New Jersey as they failed to make the Stanley Cup playoffs and never finished higher than fifth in their division. Their fortunes began to turn around following the hiring of president and general manager Lou Lamoriello in 1987. Under Lamoriello's stewardship, the Devils made the playoffs all but three times between 1988 and 2012, including 13 berths in a row from 1997 to 2010, and finished with a winning record every season from 1992 -- 93 to 2009 -- 10. They have won the Atlantic Division regular season title nine times, most recently in 2009 -- 10, before transferring to the newly created Metropolitan Division as part of the NHL's realignment in 2013. The Devils have reached the Stanley Cup Finals five times, winning in 1994 -- 95, 1999 -- 00 and 2002 -- 03. The Devils were known for their defense-first approach throughout their years of Cup contention, but have since moved towards a more offensive style.
