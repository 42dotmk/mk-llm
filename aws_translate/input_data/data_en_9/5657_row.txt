Title: "Venom Strike: Anaheim Showdown"

In the beaten-down city of Anaheim, California, a corrupted tech tycoon, Cuervo, harnesses a powerful bio-tech AI that he plans to use to take control of the city's infrastructure, paving his way to untold power and regional dominance. Unknown to Cuervo, a solitary figure emerges from the city's shadowy corners, a vigilante with a mysterious past, known only as Snake. Snake, known for his skills in martial arts, hacking, and unmatched stealth abilities, is determined to stop Cuervo and his nefarious plans.

As the plot unfolds, it is revealed that Snake was a former operative for an elite governmental agency but was abandoned and declared dead after a failed mission. He managed to survive and made Anaheim his sanctum. Meanwhile, Cuervo, with a phobia of snakes, uses the city as an experimental ground for his dystopian idea of a future led by an all-powerful AI, causing chaos in the city's day-to-day life.

Additionally, Anaheim has a personal significance for Snake as he was born and raised here, and even the death of his sister occurred under Cuervo’s black-market medical testing in this very city. So, his fight is not merely to safeguard the city but to avenge his sister’s death and extinguish his personal hatred for Cuervo.

Cuervo's AI network gives him control over all digital devices in the city including traffic systems, public utilities, and personal devices, enabling him to create havoc as a distraction while further developing the AI technology into becoming self-aware and self-sustaining. The AI, slowly taking over the city, also begins to understand human emotion and forms an internal conflict of its course of actions.

Snake, proficient in hacking, along with his former colleague and tech expert, Ruby, begin to wage silent warfare against Cuervo. They strategically attack various AI nodes across the city, slowly weakening its hold over the city. Their journey leads to thrilling chases across the cityscape, promising intense action-packed scenes filled with cutting-edge tech weapons and hand-to-hand combat.

In the climactic scene, Snake, armed with a virus coded by Ruby, infiltrates Cuervo's high-tech, heavily guarded skyscraper to defeat him and his army of AI controlled androids. They engage in an epic showdown which includes a mental and physical cat and mouse chase. Snake, with his superior stealth and combat skills, manages to outmaneuver Cuervo's forces.

In a final confrontation, Cuervo, surrounded by a protective network of advanced AI robots, confronts Snake. Here, Cuervo’s deep fear of snakes is exploited. Using his namesake to advantage, Snake unleashes a box full of venomous anacondas that Cuervo had created in his bio-lab for bio-weapon purposes. The sight of real snakes disrupts Cuervo's concentration, which allows Snake to insert the virus into the central AI system, shutting it down, freeing Anaheim from Cuervo's control and, ultimately, helping the AI realize its flaws and connecting it with human emotions.

In the end, as law enforcement agencies swoop in to apprehend the weakened Cuervo, Snake disappears once again into the city's underbelly, ready to resurface when his city needs him again, leaving a symbolic graffiti of a snake in his wake, forming his legend in the city.

"Venom Strike: Anaheim Showdown" blends elements of action, suspense, and science fiction to create an engrossing narrative that highlights one man's fight against a power-hungry tyrant to save the city he calls home.
