Q: Erin counts six trolls hiding by the path in the forest, 6 less than four times that number of trolls hiding under the bridge, and half as many trolls hiding in the plains as under the bridge. How many trolls did she count in total?
A: First, multiply the number of forest trolls by 4: 6 trolls * 4 = 24 trolls. Then subtract 6 from that number to find the number of bridge trolls: 24 trolls - 6 trolls = 18 trolls. Then divide that number by 2 to find the number of plains trolls: 18 trolls / 2 = 9 trolls. Then add the number of trolls she saw in each location to find the total number: 6 trolls + 18 trolls + 9 trolls = 33 trolls. The answer is 33.
Question: Shane prepares sandwiches for the Boy Scouts. He buys 2 packages of sliced bread containing 20 slices each, and he also buys 2 packages of sliced ham containing 8 slices each. Shane will make as many sandwiches as he can according to the ham he has. How many slices of bread will he have leftover?
Answer: With 2 packages of sliced ham, Shane has 2 * 8 = 16 slices of ham. Since he has 16 slices, Shane makes 16 sandwiches. With 2 packages of sliced bread, he has 20 * 2 = 40 slices of bread. To make the 16 sandwiches, he needs 16 * 2 = 32 slices of bread. He has 40 - 32 = 8 slices of bread leftover. The answer is 8.
[Question]Lee wants to propose marriage to Sierra. He wants to follow the adage that you should spend two months' salary on the ring. He earns $60,000 per year in salary and can save $1000 per month. How long will it take before he can propose to Sierra?
[Answer]Lee currently earns $60,000 / 12 months = $5,000 per month. The engagement ring will cost him 2 * $5,000 = $10,000. This means that it will take Lee $10,000 / $1,000 = 10 months to save enough money before he can propose. The answer is 10.
Q: Liz's basketball team is down by 20 points in the final quarter of their game. Liz goes on a shooting spree, sinking 5 free throw shots, 3 three-pointers, and 4 other jump shots. The other team only scores 10 points that quarter, and none of Liz's teammates manage to score any points. How much does Liz's team lose by at the end of the game?
A: Each free throw counts as 1 point, so 5 successful free throws means she scores 5 * 1 = 5 points. Each 3 pointer counts as 3 points, so this means Liz scores 3 * 3 = 9 points from 3 pointers. Each jump shot counts as 2 points, meaning Liz scores 4 * 2 = 8 points of jump shots. Liz's opponents score 10 points during the quarter, meaning their lead is 30 points in total before accounting for Liz's scoring. Liz scores a total of 5 + 9 + 8 = 22 points in the quarter. This amount is subtracted from the lead of Liz's opponents, meaning they win by 30 - 22 = 8 points. The answer is 8.
Question: Johnny is buying planks of wood to build some tables. Each table needs a plank of wood for each of the legs and 5 planks of wood for the surface. If Johnny wants to build 5 tables, how many planks of wood does he need?
Answer: Each table needs 1 plank of wood * 4 legs = 4 planks of wood for the legs. This means each table needs 4 planks of wood for legs + 5 planks of wood for the surface = 9 planks of wood. To build 5 tables, Johnny will therefore need 9 planks of wood * 5 tables = 45 planks of wood. The answer is 45.
