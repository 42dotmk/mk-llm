Before moving back home to live with their parents, Aubrey must go through several steps to ensure a smooth transition that can contribute to their emotional, financial, and personal well-being. These steps include the following:

1. Assess their current living situation: Aubrey should evaluate the reasons behind their decision to move back home, analyzing whether it's the best solution for their present circumstances. They should also consider if they have exhausted other viable options such as finding a new job or seeking affordable housing.

2. Communicate with their parents: Aubrey needs to have a candid conversation with their parents about their intention to move back home, seeking their consent and establishing the expectations from both parties. This would help prevent any misunderstandings and create a supportive environment.

3. Create a financial plan: It's essential for Aubrey to outline their financial goals when moving back home. They should develop a budget, establish a timeline for finding a new job, and determine how they will contribute to household expenses. This step helps maintain a sense of independence and fosters a healthier financial relationship with their parents.

4. Develop a plan for personal growth: Moving back home can be an opportunity to reassess one's life goals and identify areas for personal development. Aubrey should create a plan that includes objectives related to education, career, social interactions, and mental health. Setting specific goals will help them stay focused and motivated during their time at home.

5. Set boundaries and establish a routine: To ensure a successful cohabitation with their parents, Aubrey needs to set boundaries in terms of space, privacy, and decision-making. They should also establish a daily routine to foster discipline and maintain a semblance of normalcy.

6. Clean up and pack their belongings: Aubrey should sort through their possessions, organize them appropriately, and pack them securely to transport them back to their parents' home. They should also consider decluttering and getting rid of unnecessary items to minimize the volume of possessions they bring back.

7. Plan their move: Aubrey needs to make necessary arrangements with their current landlord regarding the termination of their lease, address change with their post office, utilities, and update friends and contacts about their new living situation.

8. Reestablish a support system: Moving back home can be an emotionally challenging experience for Aubrey; thus, it is crucial for them to cultivate a support network of friends, family, and mentors who can offer guidance and encouragement during this period of adjustment.

9. Engage in self-care: Amidst the change and upheaval, Aubrey must prioritize their emotional, mental, and physical wellbeing, seeking therapy if necessary and involving themselves in activities that promote relaxation, self-compassion, and personal growth.

10. Seek new opportunities: Finally, Aubrey should actively search for new job opportunities in line with their career aspirations or start exploring alternate career options. Volunteering, taking professional courses, and networking events can provide them with valuable resources and connections in their job search.

In summary, Aubrey should approach moving back home with a clear plan that addresses their emotional, financial, and personal needs. By taking these steps, they can create a sense of independence and pave the way for future success during this period of transition.
