Sarah was always fascinated by birds and the beautiful mess they left behind - almost like their personal signature on the world.

Monica, on the other hand, found the mess that the birds left on her car to be both irritating and unsanitary. She couldn't understand Sarah's fascination with it, let alone her enjoyment in cleaning the droppings off. Monica's distaste grew with each passing day as more and more birds seemed to make a habit of perching on the sycamore tree above her car.

On this particular day, she stepped outside to find her faithful, albeit old, gremlin green compact car absolutely plastered with the stuff - the windshield, the roof, the hood...the whole nine yards. Monica recoiled in disgust, knowing that she would be late to work if she took the time to clean everything off.

"Why do they always target my car?" Monica mumbled under her breath, irritation seeping into her voice.

"Think of it as a compliment," Sarah piped up cheerily, already running to grab a bucket of water and some cleaning rags. She had been sitting on the porch, sipping on her morning coffee, and watching the birds perform their early feathered ballet in the air above them. "Birds are very particular about the places they choose to leave their mark."

Monica rolled her eyes, not at all believing that any part of this situation could be construed as a compliment.

"No, seriously," Sarah continued, coming back with the water and rags, "in many cultures, it's considered to be a sign of good luck when a bird leaves its droppings on your head or belongings."

Monica begrudgingly joined in the cleaning effort, more so to save time than to indulge Sarah's nonsense.

"I don't see how this could possibly be considered lucky in any culture," Monica grumbled as she scrubbed at a particularly stubborn stain on the hood.

Sarah laughed, "Right, but think about it. The odds of being in the right place at the right time to have a bird release its droppings on you, or your car in this case, are astronomically small."

"That's true, I guess," Monica conceded, still not completely sold on the idea of it being a good omen. She looked at her watch and was dismayed to find that she would be cutting it incredibly close to clock-in time, despite their cleaning efforts. "Ugh, I hate being late."

Sarah clapped her friend on the shoulder, an understanding smile in her eyes. She fetched her keys and tossed them to Monica.

"Take my car today," she suggested. "It's clean, for the most part. Hurry up and don't be late."

Giving in to the inevitable, Monica accepted the keys and handed Sarah her rag, offering a soft appreciative smile. "Thanks, Sarah."

As Monica drove off to work in Sarah's car, she couldn't help but think about what Sarah had said regarding the birds and their droppings. Maybe there was something to their natural unpredictability that spoke to the deeper, unexplainable mysteries of life. For a moment, she allowed herself to consider that the droppings were somewhat beautiful, even in their chaos.

From that day on, Monica still hated cleaning the bird droppings from her car, but perhaps not quite as much as before. There was a begrudging respect for the chaotic nature of the birds and their droppings, and an odd sense of gratitude for friends like Sarah who could find beauty even in the messiest of situations. And with every cleaned stain, Monica found herself growing more and more appreciative of her feathered foes and secretly hoping that their peculiar form of luck would indeed bring her good fortune.
