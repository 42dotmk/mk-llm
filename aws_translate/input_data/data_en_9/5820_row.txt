[Question]Darius, Matt, and Marius are friends, who played table football. During all the games they played, Marius scored 3 points more than Darius, and Darius scored 5 points less than Matt. How many points did all three friends score together, if Darius scored 10 points?
[Answer]If Darius scored 10 points, then Marius scored 10 + 3 = 13 points in total. Darius scored 5 points less than Matt, so Matt scored 10 + 5 = 15 points in total. So all three friends gathered 13 + 15 + 10 = 38 points. The answer is 38.
Q: Scott has 7 pairs of shoes. Anthony has 3 times as many pairs of shoes as Scott, and Jim has 2 less pairs than Anthony. How many more pairs of shoes does Anthony have compared to Jim?

Question: Carson runs a carpool for five of his friends. The five of them cover all the gas expenses to compensate Carson for his time. Their total commute is 21 miles one way, gas costs $2.50/gallon, Carson's car gets 30 miles/gallon, and they commute to work 5 days a week, 4 weeks a month. How much does each person pay toward gas monthly?
Answer: First find the total number of monthly commutes: 5 days / week * 4 weeks / month = 20 days / month. Then multiply the distance of the commute one way by the two ways: 21 miles * 2 = 42 miles. Then multiply the number of commutes by the number of miles per commute: 42 miles / commute * 20 commutes = 840 miles. Then divide the number of miles by the car's gas mileage: 840 miles / 30 miles / gallon = 28 gallons. Then multiply that number by the cost of each gallon to find the total cost: 28 gallons * $2.50 / gallon = $70. Then divide the total cost by the number of friends to find the cost per person: $70 / 5 people = $14 / person. The answer is 14.
[Question]A global gym decides to replace all of its cardio machines. They have 20 gyms. Each gym has 10 bikes, 5 treadmills, and 5 elliptical machines. The bikes cost $700 each. The treadmills cost 50% more than that. The elliptical machines are twice as expensive as the treadmills. How much does it cost to replace everything?
[Answer]The gym needs to buy 20 * 10 = 200 bikes. 20 * 5 = 100 each of treadmills and ellipticals. So the bikes cost 200 * 700 = $140,000. The treadmills cost 700 * 1.5 = $1,050 each. So they cost a total of 1050 * 100 = $105,000. The ellipticals each cost 1050 * 2 = $2100. So in total the ellipticals cost 2100 * 100 = $210,000. So the total cost of everything is 140,000 + 105,000 + 210,000 = $455,000. The answer is 455000.
Q: Jessy told eleven jokes this past Saturday, and Alan told seven jokes. If they doubled the number of jokes they told this past Saturday next Saturday, how many jokes would they have told in total together so far?
A: This past Saturday, Jessy and Alan told a total of 11 + 7 = 18 jokes together. Since Jessy told eleven jokes this past Saturday, when he doubles the number of jokes next Saturday, the number of jokes will be 2 * 11 = 22 next Saturday. At the same time, after telling seven jokes this Saturday, when he doubles the number of jokes next Saturday, Alan will tell 2 * 7 = 14 jokes. Next Saturday, they will tell 14 + 22 = 36 jokes together. In total, the number of jokes will be 36 + 18 = 54 jokes on the two Saturdays. The answer is 54.
