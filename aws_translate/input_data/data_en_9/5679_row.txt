The statement "People use the internet so publishing is not a big deal anymore" oversimplifies the situation, but it does reflect some aspects of the current state of the publishing industry. With the rise of the internet, the way people consume information has significantly changed. This has had a tremendous impact on traditional print media such as newspapers, magazines, and books. In recent years, there has been a decline in importance for traditional publishing as more content creators and consumers have shifted their focus to digital media. However, it is crucial to explore various aspects before concluding that publishing is not a big deal anymore.

To begin with, digital publishing has become increasingly popular due to the ease of access, cost-effectiveness, and vast reach it provides to authors and readers globally. Many people now consume news online, read e-books, or listen to audiobooks. This shift has led to the decline of physical book sales in some areas, but in other parts of the world, print books are still thriving. In this context, the term "publishing" has not become irrelevant. On the contrary, it has evolved and adapted to technological advances, giving birth to the flexible and dynamic world of digital publishing.

In the same vein, self-publishing has emerged as a significant player in the publishing industry, providing more opportunities for authors to get their work published and promoted without depending on established publishers. This trend has democratized the publishing industry, allowing for diverse voices and ideas to reach audiences worldwide. Thus, while traditional publishing may have diminished importance, self-publishing platforms create more access for authors and content creators.

Regarding the legacy of the publishing industry, such as the numerous bookstores selling second-hand, antiquarian, and new books, it is essential to highlight that physical books still hold an enduring appeal for many people. Even with the internet and various digital reading platforms, some readers continue to prefer print books, and bookstores fulfill that demand. Additionally, bookstores facilitate the local literary culture, create community spaces, and provide an outlet for independent authors and local publications to reach their target audience.

Moreover, publishing does not solely revolve around books. The publishing industry encompasses various formats, including newspapers, magazines, academic journals, and online content. The range of mediums has expanded with the rise of the internet, which necessitates adapting to the changing landscape. While traditional print media may face challenges, the overall concept of publishing - be it in print or digital form - continues to play a vital role in disseminating ideas, entertainment, news, and research.

In summary, attributing the decline in the importance of traditional publishing solely to people using the internet is an oversimplification. While the internet has brought a paradigm shift that affects publishing, the industry is far from losing its significance. Publishing has transformed and diversified, adapting to the changing needs of authors and readers alike. It is essential not to downplay the importance of digital publishing or underestimate the ongoing appeal of physical books and their cultural significance in society. The publishing industry may have been reshaped by new technologies, but it remains an influential force in the dissemination of content, knowledge, and creativity.
