Q: Jason is hiring two construction workers, one electrician and one plumber. If the construction workers each make $100/day, the electrician makes double what a worker is paid and the plumber makes 250% of a worker's salary, how much are the overall labor costs for one day?
A: First find how much the electrician earns per day: $100 / day * 2 = $200 / day. Then find how much the plumber earns per day: $100 / day * 250% = $250 / day. Then find how much both workers pay together: $100 / day / worker * 2 workers = $200 / day. Then add the cost of each worker to find the total labor cost per day: $200 / day + $250 / day + $200 / day = $650 / day. The answer is 650.
Question: Austin and Jake start descending from the 9th floor of a building at the same time. Austin uses the elevator and Jake uses the stairs, descending 3 steps every second. The stairs have 30 steps across each floor. If the elevator will take a minute to get to ground level, how many seconds later will Jake get to the ground floor?
Answer: Jake has to descend 30 steps on 9 floors for a total of 9 * 30 = 270 steps. He descends 3 steps every second so he will descend 270 steps in 270 / 3 = 90 seconds. Austin will get down after only a minute (60 seconds) so Jake will get down 90 - 60 = 30 seconds later. The answer is 30.
[Question]Jordan's dog, Max, was born on the same day that Luka turned 4 years old. Luka is exactly 2 years older than is Aubrey. On Aubrey's 8th birthday, how many years old was Jordan's dog, Max?
[Answer]If Luka is exactly 2 years older than is Aubrey, then on Aubrey's 8th birthday, Luka was 8 + 2 = 10 years old. If Jordan's dog, Max, was born on the same day that Luka turned 4 years old, then when Luka was 10 years old, Max was 10 - 4 = 6 years old. The answer is 6.
Q: A mother is serving pizza at her son's birthday party. After buying 5 pizzas, she must decide how many slices to divide each pizza into so that everyone at the party ends up with an equal number of slices. There are a total of 20 children at the party, and she can choose to divide each pizza into either 6, 8, or 10 slices. Assuming she does not want to throw away any pizza, how should many slices should she choose to divide the pizzas into to make sure everyone receives an equal amount?
A: Checking each possibility, we can see that dividing each pizza into 6 slices yields 5 * 6 = 30 total slices, dividing each pizza into 8 slices yields 5 * 8 = 40 total slices, and dividing each pizza into 10 slices yields 5 * 10 = 50 total slices. Because each child must receive the same number of slices, the total number of slices must be evenly divisible by 20. The only option that satisfies this requirement is dividing the pizza into 8 slices, as 40 / 20 = 2 slices per child. Therefore, the mother should divide each pizza into 8 slices. The answer is 8.
Question: Jeremy decides to take Tylenol because of the pain he is experiencing. He decides to take 1000 mg every 6 hours for 2 weeks. How many pills do they take if they are each 500 mg?
Answer: He takes 1000 / 500 = 2 pills each time. He takes them 24 / 6 = 4 times a day. So he takes 4 * 2 = 8 pills per day. He takes pills for 2 * 7 = 14 days. So he takes 8 * 14 = 112 pills. The answer is 112.
