Q: Bella bought stamps at the post office. Some of the stamps had a snowflake design, some had a truck design, and some had a rose design. Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps. She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. How many stamps did Bella buy in all?
A: The number of truck stamps is 11 + 9 = 20. The number of rose stamps is 20 âˆ’ 13 = 7. Bella bought 11 + 20 + 7 = 38 stamps in all. The answer is 38.
Question: Alex has not washed his clothes for a month; 18 shirts, 12 pants, 17 sweaters, and 13 jeans are waiting to be washed. Alex's washing machine can wash a maximum of 15 items per cycle. Each cycle takes 45 minutes. How many hours will it take the washing machine to wash all the clothes?
Answer: Alex will wash 18 + 12 + 17 + 13 = 60 items. With 20 items per wash cycle, Alex will wash the clothes in 60 / 15 = 4 cycles. With 45 minutes per cycle, the washing machine will take 45 * 4 = 180 minutes to wash the clothes. As 1 hour has 60 minutes, the washing machine will take 180 / 60 = 3 hours to wash the clothes. The answer is 3.
[Question]Bob is building raised beds for his vegetable garden. Each bed is 2 feet high, 2 feet wide, and 8 feet long. The sides are going to be built of 1-foot wide planks. If Bob buys his lumber in 8-foot-long boards, planning to cut some of them for the shorter lengths he'll need, how many 8-foot long planks will he need to construct 10 raised beds?
[Answer]Each raised bed is 8 feet long, the same as the planks, so the long sides of the beds will each be 1 plank long. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, or 2 / 8 = 1 / 4 the length of the planks, so the short sides will each be 1 / 4 plank long. Each bed is 2 feet tall, and the planks are 1 foot wide, so each side will need 2 pieces of lumber of the same length. So each bed will require 2 * 2 * 1.25 = 4 * 1.25 = 5 planks of wood. Bob wants to build 10 raised beds, so he will need 10 * 5 = 50 planks of lumber. The answer is 50.
Q: A carnival snack booth made $50 selling popcorn each day. It made three times as much selling cotton candy. For a 5-day activity, the booth has to pay $30 rent and $75 for the cost of the ingredients. How much did the booth earn for 5 days after paying the rent and the cost of ingredients?
A: The booth made $50 x 3 = $150 selling cotton candy each day. In a day, the booth made a total of $150 + $50 = $200. In 5 days, they made a total of $200 x 5 = $1000. The booth has to pay a total of $30 + $75 = $105. Thus, the booth earned $1000 - $105 = $895. The answer is 895.
Question: A train leaves its departure station with 6 coal cars, 12 iron cars, and 2 wood cars. Between each station, there are 6 miles, and it takes 25 minutes to travel between them. At each station, the train can deposit up to 2 coal cars, 3 iron cars, and 1 wood car. How many minutes will it take to deliver all the cars?
Answer: To deliver all the coal, you need to pass by 6 coal / 2 coal / station = 3 stations. To deliver all the iron, you need to pass by 12 iron / 3 iron / station = 4 stations. To deliver all the wood, you need to pass by 2 wood / 1 wood / station = 2 stations. So 4 stations are needed to deliver everything, so 4 stations * 25 minutes / station = 100 minutes are needed. The answer is 100.
