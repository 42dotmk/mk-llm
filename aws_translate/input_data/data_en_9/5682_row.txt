Question: Whitney’s mom gave her two $20 bills to spend at the school book fair. Whitney has decided to buy 2 posters, 3 notebooks, and 2 bookmarks. Each poster costs $5, each notebook costs $4, and each bookmark costs $2. How much money, in dollars, will Whitney have left over after the purchase?
Answer: Whitney is buying 2 posters for $5 each, so the posters will cost 2 * $5 = $10 total cost for posters. Whitney is buying 3 notebooks for $4 each, so the notebooks will cost 3 * $4 = $12 total cost for notebooks. Whitney is buying 2 notebooks for $2, so the bookmarks 2 * $2 = $4 total cost for bookmarks. Since Whitney is paying $10 for posters, $12 for notebooks, and $4 for bookmarks, her total purchase will cost $10 + $12 + $4 = $26 total purchase cost. Whitney’s mom gave her 2 $20 bills, so she will be paying with 2 * $20 = $40 total payment. Since Whitney is paying with $40 and her purchase cost will be $26, she will have $40 - $26 = $14 left over after the purchase. The answer is 14.
[Question]Mr. Caiden wants to do repairs to his house and requires 300 feet of metal roofing to do this. If each foot of roofing costs $8, and the supplier of the metal roofing brings in 250 feet of metal roofing for free, how much money is Mr. Caiden required to pay for the remaining metal roofing?
[Answer]The supplier brought 300 ft - 250 ft = 50 fewer feet of metal roofing. Therefore the total amount of money Mr. Caiden has to pay for the remaining metal roofings is 50 feet * $8 / foot = $400. The answer is 400.
Q: Troy had 300 straws. He fed 3/5 of the straws to the adult pigs and an equal number of straws to the piglets. If there were 20 piglets, how many straws did each piglet eat?
A: The adult pigs ate 3 / 5 * 300 = 180 straws. The total number of straws that the piglets shared is 300 - 180 = 120. Since there were 20 piglets, each piglet ate 120 / 20 = 6 straws. The answer is 6.
Question: A plumber is trying to decide which of three different jobs he should take to make the most money. The first job involves fixing three toilets and three sinks at an apartment complex. The second involves two toilets and five sinks at a different apartment complex. The third involves fixing one toilet, two showers and three sinks at a third apartment complex. If the plumber charges $30 to fix a sink, $40 to fix a shower and $50 to fix a toilet, what is the most money the plumber can earn if he can only choose one of these three jobs?
Answer: If the plumber chooses the first job, he would earn 3 * 50 + 3 * 30 = $240. If he chooses the second, he'd earn 2 * 50 + 5 * 30 = $250. If he chooses the third, he'd earn 50 + 2 * 40 + 3 * 30 = $220. Therefore, the most money he can earn from one of these jobs is $250. The answer is 250.
[Question]John decides to learn how to play the piano. He buys a piano for $500. He then hires a teacher for 20 lessons at $40 per lesson but ends up getting a 25% discount. How much did everything cost?
[Answer]The normal price of the lessons would be 20 * 40 = $800. The discount saves him 800 * .25 = $200. So the lessons cost him 800 - 200 = $600. That means everything costs 500 + 600 = $1100. The answer is 1100.
