Title: Economic Impact of the Wars Against Aragon and England Over Gascony: A Combined Cost Analysis

Introduction:

Throughout the course of history, nations and empires have engaged in warfare for various reasons such as territorial disputes, resources, and political ideology. In this analysis, we shall focus on the wars against Aragon and the war against England over Gascony, delving into the combined financial burden these conflicts imposed. Before we calculate the total cost, it is essential to unravel each conflict to provide a basic understanding of the situations.

Step 1: Understanding the Wars

A. War against Aragon:
The war against Aragon took place in the late 13th century and early 14th century. This conflict was primarily a struggle for the control of the Mediterranean, as both kingdoms fought for dominance. The underlying cause of these wars was political, territorial, and commercial.

B. War against England over Gascony:
Also known as the Hundred Years' War, the long-standing conflict between England and France stretched from 1337 to 1453. The main contention in this war was the English king's claim to the French throne and the allegiance of Gascony, a region situated in the southwest of the Kingdom of France. Gascony was essential to both nations due to its fertile lands and abundant resources.

Step 2: Estimation of the War Cost in Livres Tournois (LT)

To gauge the combined cost of these wars, we must estimate their individual costs. The cost of war generally includes military expenses, provisions, and resources, administrative costs, and potential loss of life and property. As most historical records use the currency Livres Tournois (LT), it is important to adhere to this standard while calculating costs.

A. War against Aragon:
Though accurate records of the total cost of the war against Aragon are scarce, a conservative estimate would place it at several millions of LT. Factors such as the length of the war, the size of the armies involved, and the cost of logistics and administration are some relevant variables that contribute to this staggering figure.

B. War against England over Gascony:
Historians have estimated the cost of the Hundred Years' War to be around 60-100 million LT, assuming the number of troops involved, weapons and armament expenditures, food and supplies, siege equipment, and navy upkeep and construction.

Step 3: Combined Cost of the Wars

To determine the combined cost of the wars against Aragon and the war against England over Gascony, we add the estimated costs together. As specific numbers for the war against Aragon are unavailable, the assertion made for this analysis will be based on a rough estimate.

Assuming the war against Aragon cost X million LT, the total combined cost of both wars would then be:

Combined Cost = X million LT (War against Aragon) + 60 to 100 million LT (War against England over Gascony)

Conclusion:

An estimation of the combined cost of the wars against Aragon and England over Gascony places the figure at X million LT (for the war against Aragon) plus 60 to 100 million LT (for the Hundred Years' War). While the lack of precise data regarding the War against Aragon makes it challenging to propose an exact amount, it is clear from historical accounts that both wars imposed a significant financial burden. The resources invested in these conflicts undoubtedly influenced each nation's economy and had lasting consequences not only on the societies involved but also on the contemporary geopolitical landscape.
