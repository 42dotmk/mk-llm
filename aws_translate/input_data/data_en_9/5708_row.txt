The locals are skeptical about who Nualjan is and why she has chosen to reside in their village. Rumors quickly spread regarding the secrets she might be harboring. Intrigued by the gossip, a young journalist named Sam decides to uncover the truth about Nualjan's past and the reason behind her sudden appearance in the village.

Legend has it that the mansion was once a place of happiness and love, owned by a wealthy family. However, the family disappeared inexplicably one fateful night, leaving no trace behind.

Determined to solve the mystery, Sam befriends Nualjan and tries to find out more about her story.

As Sam continues to dig deeper, he starts to unravel the mystery about Nualjan's connection to the mansion.

Act II: Sam discovers a hidden room in the mansion that contains a diary belonging to the wealthy family's daughter, Lillian, who lived in the mansion generations ago. As he reads through the diary, he realizes that Lillian had written about Nualjan as her long-lost twin sister.

Upon confronting Nualjan with her heritage, she recalls a tragic event from her past that led her to the village and the mansion. Despite being separated from her twin sister, she always felt an inexplicable connection to the village. After the death of her adoptive parents, Nualjan decided to follow her instincts and search for the truth behind her origins.

Skeptical at first, Sam and Nualjan begin to notice strange occurrences happening in the village, echoing the dark prophecy. As they delve deeper into the mansion's secrets, they begin to unravel a hidden history of magic, deceit, and betrayal that binds both Nualjan and Lillian to the tragic fate of their family.

Together, they set out on a journey to unlock the truth about their family's past, decipher the prophecy, and confront the malevolent force that threatens to destroy the village.
