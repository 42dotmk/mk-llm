The Ford version of the El Camino is called the Ford Ranchero. The Chevrolet El Camino and the Ford Ranchero were both coupe utility vehicles, which combined the features of a pickup truck and a passenger car in a single model. These types of vehicles were popular choices for customers seeking a practical and versatile automobile with a stylish, comfortable interior. The El Camino and Ranchero shared many similarities, but they had several distinguishing features that set them apart as products of their respective manufacturers.

The Ford Ranchero was first introduced in 1957, two years before the Chevrolet El Camino. Ford was inspired by the utility vehicles from Australia, specifically the "Ute" concept where a vehicle was designed to serve the needs of both farmers and business owners who required a combination of work and family car without having to own separate ones. The first-generation Ranchero was based on the 1957 Ford Courier sedan delivery model, which itself was a full-sized, car-based vehicle. This design choice provided a smooth, car-like ride and a comfortable, well-appointed cabin, making it a practical and stylish alternative to the traditional pickup truck.

The Ranchero was produced in various iterations between the years 1957 to 1979, totaling seven generations. The vehicle evolved over time, adapting to different market preferences and the changing automotive landscape:

1. First Generation (1957–1959): Based on the Ford Courier sedan delivery and the full-sized Ford Fairlane, the first Ranchero boasted a stylish exterior, car-like ride quality, and high payload capacity.
 
2. Second Generation (1960–1965): The second Ranchero was built on the compact Ford Falcon platform, offering improved fuel efficiency and increased maneuverability while maintaining its utility and style.

3. Third Generation (1966–1967): The Ranchero now shared its platform with the Ford Fairlane, entering the mid-sized market with upgraded engine options and enhanced styling.

4. Fourth Generation (1968–1969): Ford's Torino served as the basis for this generation of Ranchero, which featured more muscular styling, improved suspension, and a range of powerful engine options.

5. Fifth Generation (1970–1971): Built on the Ford Torino Cobra platform, this generation of Ranchero offered high-performance engine choices and distinctive styling.

6. Sixth Generation (1972–1976): Emphasizing luxury over performance, this Ranchero was designed with the Ford Torino Elite in mind, featuring more comfortable interiors and an emphasis on ride quality.

7. Seventh Generation (1977–1979): The last generation of Ranchero was built on Ford's LTD II platform, maintaining the mix of utility and style that had made the vehicle popular.

Throughout its production run, the Ford Ranchero was offered with a range of engine options, including inline-six, V8, and even some high-performance options in certain years. The vehicle's exterior design also evolved, influenced by the styling trends and preferences of each decade, such as the muscle car craze in the late 60s and early 70s.

In summary, the Ford Ranchero was an American coupe utility vehicle and the Ford equivalent of the Chevrolet El Camino. It was produced between the years 1957 to 1979, and its design evolved over seven generations to meet the ever-changing preferences of its target market. Despite being discontinued, the Ford Ranchero and Chevrolet El Camino still hold nostalgic appeal to fans of these distinct and versatile vehicles.
