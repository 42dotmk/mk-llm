[Question]Three snails raced across a rain-soaked sidewalk. The first snail raced at a speed of 2 feet per minute. The second snail raced at twice the speed of the first snail. And the third snail traveled at five times the rate of speed as the second snail. If it took the first snail 20 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk, how long, in minutes, did it take for the third snail to race all the way up the sidewalk?
[Answer]If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20 / 2 = 10 minutes to complete the race. If the third snail raced at five times the speed of the second snail, then it would take the third snail 10 / 5 = 2 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk. The answer is 2.
Q: There are 20 cars lined up at a race. Each of the cars have 2 passengers and a driver, then when the cars go past the race’s halfway point, each car gains another passenger. The cars then continue racing, and the race finishes once every single car has passed the finish line. People who get into the cars have to stay inside of them until the race is finished. How many people are in the cars by the end of the race?
A: There are 2 passengers and a driver in each car, which means that in each car there are 2 passengers + 1 driver = 3 people. This means there are a total of 20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people in the car at the start of the race. At the halfway point, there is an additional 20 cars * 1 additional passenger = 20 more people. So be the end of the race, there are 60 people at the start of the race + 20 additional people = 80 people in the cars. The answer is 80.
Question: Lucca has 100 balls and 10 percent of his balls are basketballs. Lucien has 200 balls and 20 percent of them are basketballs. In total how many basketballs do Lucca and Lucien have?
Answer: Lucca has 100 basketballs x (10 / 100) = 10 basketballs. Lucien has 200 basketballs x (20 / 100) = 40 basketballs. Together they have 10 basketballs + 40 basketballs = 50 basketballs. The answer is 50.
[Question]A truck driver’s heavy semi truck can go 3 miles per gallon of gas. The truck driver needs to put gas in his truck at one gas station, but wants to put the minimum amount he needs to get him to a much cheaper gas station 90 miles away. He already has 12 gallons of gas in his tank. How many more gallons does the truck driver need to put in his semi to make it to the cheaper gas station?
[Answer]The truck driver can go 3 * 12 = 36 miles on the gas in his tank. He needs to go 90 - 36 = 54 more miles. Thus, the truck driver needs to put 54 / 3 = 18 more gallons of gas in his semi. The answer is 18.
Q: Daisy's Flower Shop sold 45 daisies on its first day. On their second day, they sold 20 more flowers than they did on their first day. On the third day, they sold 10 less than twice the flowers that were sold than on the second day. If the flower shop sold a total of 350 daisies for 4 days, how many daisies were sold on the 4th day?
A: The flower shop sold 45 + 20 = 65 daisies on the second day. Twice the number of flowers on the second day is 65 x 2 = 130. So, the flower shop sold 130 - 10 = 120 daisies on the third day. The total daisies sold for 3 days was 45 + 65 + 120 = 230. Therefore, 350 - 230 = 120 daisies were sold on the 4th day. The answer is 120.
