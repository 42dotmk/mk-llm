In the late 19th century, Butch Cassidy (played by Tom Hardy) and the Sundance Kid (played by Chris Hemsworth), two legendary outlaws, find themselves running from a relentless posse led by an ambitious young lawman named Sheriff Wallace (played by Michael B. Jordan). After commandeering a train in an early morning heist, Cassidy and Sundance come across a treasure map, but with a twist: it reveals the location of a mythical treasure called "The Dark Shore," a hidden paradise allegedly filled with untold riches and gold from ancient civilizations. 

Cassidy and Sundance decide to team up and follow the map, hoping to gain enough wealth to escape their outlaw lifestyles and survive outside the grasp of the law, starting fresh lives in a peaceful, unknown territory. Along the trail, they befriend an enigmatic Native American woman named Running Winds (played by Q'orianka Kilcher) who possesses insight into the mystical legends surrounding the Dark Shore and its connection to her ancestors. Running Winds agrees to help the duo, driven by a desire to reunite with her long-lost tribe and uncover the truth behind the Dark Shore.

As Cassidy, Sundance, and Running Winds journey across the treacherous and unforgiving wild west landscape, they encounter a multitude of obstacles, including fierce storms, hostile natives, and even mystical creatures guarding the path to the Dark Shore. Meanwhile, Sheriff Wallace, consumed by his eagerness for capturing the notorious outlaws, continues to hunt them down relentlessly, hellbent on putting an end to their reign of crime.

Throughout the journey, the bond between Cassidy and Sundance grows stronger as they learn more about each other's pasts and the experiences that shaped them. At the same time, a romantic tension develops between Sundance and Running Winds, as her resilience, grace, and wisdom captivate the notorious gunslinger. Sundance begins questioning his path and starts to imagine a life with Running Winds, away from the perilous outlaw existence that accompanies being Butch Cassidy's closest companion.

As the trio approaches the Dark Shore's hidden location, Cassidy starts to question the authenticity of the treasure and the true cost of finding it. However, driven by their desires for redemption and freedom, they forge ahead while the relentless posse led by Sheriff Wallace rapidly closes in.

Upon arriving at the mystical Dark Shore, the trio discovers an astounding truth: the treasure is not gold or material riches, but a powerful secret rooted in ancient wisdom and the revered natural world. Realizing that the greatest treasure is the connection they have formed with one another and Running Winds' people, Cassidy and Sundance make the ultimate decision concerning their fates as outlaws.

As the posse finally catches up to the treasure seekers, Cassidy makes a selfless sacrifice, confronting the lawmen, which allows Sundance and Running Winds to escape and start a new life together in the mystical realm of the Dark Shore.
