No, the statement "On 17 April 1941, after King Peter II and other members of the government fled the country, the remaining representatives of the government and military met with the German officials in Belgrade." does not correctly answer the question of what Tito used to get the people to unite in a battle against the occupation in 1941.

While the statement does mention an important event in Yugoslav history during World War II, it does not adequately address Tito's role or the methods he used to rally the people against the occupation. To provide a more detailed and accurate answer to the question, it is important to focus on Tito's specific actions, leadership, and ideology.

Josip Broz Tito, a communist revolutionary, became the leader of the Yugoslav Partisans during World War II. The Partisans were a resistance movement against the Axis occupation and their local collaborators in Yugoslavia. Tito was able to motivate and unite his followers in the battle against occupation through various means.

1. Ideology: Tito and his fellow communists emphasized the importance of a unified struggle against fascist and nationalist oppressors. By promoting the shared goal of communism and a society void of class distinctions, Tito was able to rally various factions of the Yugoslav population together, transcending the divisions between the different ethnic and religious groups.

2. Resistance to Occupation: Tito capitalized on the resentment Yugoslav people felt towards the occupying forces, particularly the brutality of the German, Italian, and Hungarian armies, as well as the collaborationist regimes like the Ustaše-led Independent State of Croatia and the Serbian puppet government run by Milan Nedić. By providing a military and political alternative to these entities, Tito attracted support from a broad spectrum of the population.

3. Organization and Military Strategy: Tito's leadership proved to be effective, as he was able to organize and coordinate diverse resistance groups into a united, disciplined, and effective fighting force. The Yugoslav Partisans employed guerilla warfare tactics, which helped them to launch successful attacks against the numerically superior, well-equipped enemy forces. These victories increased public support for the Partisans and augmented their ranks as more people joined them.

4. Aligning with the Allies: Tito's Partisans established contact with the Western Allies, particularly the British, and gained support through the supply of weapons, equipment, and intelligence. This international support further legitimized the Partisans and boosted morale, as it signaled that the world considered them a legitimate force fighting against Axis occupiers.

5. Creation of a Parallel Government: The Partisans established the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ) in 1942, which functioned as a political representation for the resistance movement. This council provided a political framework for the post-war communist government and allowed Tito to showcase a vision for the future of a liberated and united Yugoslavia.

Through a combination of ideology, resistance to occupation, effective organization, military strategy, external support, and establishment of a parallel government, Tito was able to unite the Yugoslav population in a common struggle against the Axis occupation in 1941. These factors provided a strong foundation for both the Partisan forces and Tito's eventual ascent as the leader of socialist Yugoslavia after World War II.
