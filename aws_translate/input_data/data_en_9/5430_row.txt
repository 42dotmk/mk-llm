From the given premise ("She was either terribly ignorant about economic affairs or terribly foresighted."), we can deduce a scenario in which a woman has one of two distinct qualities with respect to her understanding of economic affairs. On the one hand, if she is deemed to be terribly ignorant, she would likely possess a limited and potentially flawed understanding of economic concepts, trends, and how they affect overall economic well-being. Conversely, if she is considered terribly foresighted, she most likely has an advanced grasp of economic matters, one that enables her to make accurate predictions and understand the dynamics of the economic machinery, often long before others do.

Now, let's address the hypothesis "We thought it was better for her to be terribly foresighted than ignorant." This statement indicates that, given the premise, a group of people holds the belief that it would be more advantageous for the woman in question to possess the attribute of being terribly foresighted rather than being terribly ignorant. The thought process behind this hypothesis may be grounded in the potential benefits that foresight brings in economic matters, such as the ability to anticipate changes and adapt accordingly and the capacity to make informed decisions that promote financial success and stability.

In order to examine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we must first clarify what it means for a statement to "entail" another statement. In the context of logical arguments, the term "entailment" refers to the relationship between two statements in which the truth of one statement (the premise) guarantees the truth of the other (the conclusion). If the premise is true and logically entails the hypothesis, then the hypothesis must also be true. Conversely, if the premise is true but does not logically entail the hypothesis, then the hypothesis might still be false under some circumstances.

In our case, the premise informs us of two possible states regarding the woman's knowledge of economic affairs, while the hypothesis is concerned with the preference of a group of people. Although the premise establishes the existence of two distinct qualities she might possess, it does not make any explicit claim about which quality is preferred or better from any particular perspective. The original premise is simply presenting a dichotomy of either ignorance or foresight, without any inherent value or preference attached to either of these qualities.

It is important to note that the hypothesis might still be true even if the premise does not entail it. In other words, in a given situation, people might indeed find it better for her to be terribly foresighted than ignorant. However, this preference is not implied or guaranteed by the premise. Therefore, even if the premise is true, the hypothesis does not necessarily follow; the two statements are logically independent.

In summary, the truth of the premise "She was either terribly ignorant about economic affairs or terribly foresighted" does not entail the hypothesis "We thought it was better for her to be terribly foresighted than ignorant." Although the premise lays the foundation for a possible scenario involving the woman's level of understanding about economic matters, it does not inherently guarantee or imply the preference expressed in the hypothesis, which remains independent and will rely on additional information about the beliefs and values of the group of people involved.
