Title: The Riviera Caper

Step 1: Establish the main characters
Our main character, Glenn Porter, is a charming, adventurous, but down-on-his-luck con artist. He is accompanied by his best friend, Samuel, a tech-savvy, wary, and cautious accomplice. They target the rich and powerful using the infamous Riviera Hotel as their base of operations.

Step 2: Set the stage
Glenn and Samuel, after being kicked out of several hotels due to their misdeeds, find themselves checked into the famous (and famous for being ultra-secure) Riviera Hotel. They have done their research and have identified the richest and most influential people staying at the hotel, planning to execute a con that will set them up for life.

Step 3: Introduce the hotel manager
Ruby Torres, the formidable hotel manager of the Riviera, has a reputation for keeping her establishment free from criminal activity. She is renowned for her sharp instincts, having thwarted numerous criminal plans at the Riviera. Glenn and Samuel understand the challenge they've taken on, but are undeterred.

Step 4: Introduce new character - love interest
Glenn finds himself smitten by a beautiful guest, Charlotte, who turns out to be the daughter of one of his wealthy targets. As Glenn gets closer to her, he begins to question his motives and the ethics of his plans.

Step 5: Kick off the con
Glenn and Samuel start their con by hacking into the hotel's security system and using the information they gather to gain the trust of the wealthy guests. Things take an unexpected turn when Glenn, trying to reveal a guest's darkest secret, accidentally breaks a window at the hotel, drawing unwanted attention to himself.

Step 6: The complication
Ruby, the hotel manager, launches an investigation into the broken window incident, forcing Glenn and Samuel to execute their plan hastily. Meanwhile, Glenn's growing friendship with Charlotte complicates matters, as he learns that her father is in financial trouble and she is unaware of his double life.

Step 7: The conflict
Torn between his feelings for Charlotte and loyalty to Samuel, Glenn struggles to find a balance when executing the con. As Ruby's investigation comes dangerously close to uncovering their secret, Glenn must decide whether to side with Samuel and break Charlotte's trust or to abandon the con and reveal his true intentions to Charlotte.

Step 8: The climax
In a dramatic turn of events, Glenn chooses to betray Samuel and confesses everything to Charlotte and her father. Together, they devise a plan to expose the criminal activities of other wealthy guests at the Riviera, ultimately putting them on Ruby's radar and providing cover for their previous actions.

Step 9: The resolution
Glenn, Charlotte, and her father succeed in their mission, and Ruby apprehends the exposed criminals. With their newfound bond, Glenn and Charlotte begin to build a real relationship, leaving the life of deception and luxury cons behind. Samuel, feeling betrayed by Glenn, slips away from the Riviera and disappears into the shadows, setting up potential for a future encounter.

Step 10: The denouement
Glenn and Charlotte's love story unfolds as they start a new life together, away from the Riviera. The hotel is infamous for its "Riviera Caper" episode but becomes even more renowned for its top-notch security under Ruby's eagle-eyed watch. Meanwhile, the ever-elusive Samuel bides his time, waiting for the perfect opportunity to resurface and seek revenge on his former friend, Glenn.
