To open a bottle of wine, follow these detailed steps to ensure you accomplish the task successfully and safely:

1. Gather the required tools:
   - A wine bottle
   - A corkscrew, preferably a double-hinged waiter's corkscrew
   - A wine napkin or a small towel (optional)

2. Examine the bottle and remove any foil or outer wrapping:
   - Before you begin, observe the wine bottle. Some bottles might have a foil wrapper around the cork and the bottle neck. If this is the case, locate the small tab on the foil, hold the wine bottle firmly with your non-dominant hand, and slowly pull the tab to remove the foil. If there's no tab, use a knife or the foil cutter on the corkscrew to carefully cut the foil around the top of the bottle.
   - Alternatively, some bottles might have a wax seal. Gently scrape off the wax with a knife or the blade of the corkscrew.

3. Position the corkscrew and prepare to open the bottle:
   - Hold the wine bottle in your non-dominant hand, ensuring to keep a firm grip. With your other hand, open up the corkscrew and unfold the helix (sharp, spiraled portion for inserting into the cork) and the lever of the double-hinged waiter's corkscrew.
   - If using a wine napkin or towel, place it around the neck of the bottle to catch any possible wine drips.

4. Insert the corkscrew helix into the cork:
   - Position the tip of the helix slightly off-center on the cork.
   - Slowly twist the corkscrew handle clockwise, ensuring that the helix enters the cork straight and gradually. Continue twisting until only one curve of the helix remains visible. Avoid going too far, as you might puncture the bottom of the cork, which can lead to wine leakage and cork crumbling.

5. Use the waiter's corkscrew lever to assist in removing the cork:
   - Since you are using a double-hinged corkscrew, there will be two notches on the lever. Position the first (lower) notch on the lip of the bottle, keeping the corkscrew handle raised.
   - Hold the bottle firmly and begin applying upward pressure on the corkscrew handle while maintaining the lever's position on the bottle lip. This will slowly start to pull the cork out.
   - Once the cork has raised enough, switch to the second (upper) notch of the lever and reposition it on the lip of the bottle.
   - Continue applying upward pressure on the corkscrew handle, easing the cork out of the bottle until it is almost completely removed.

6. Remove the cork from the corkscrew:
   - Gently twist the cork counter-clockwise while pulling it away from the bottle to completely remove it.
   - Hold the cork with your non-dominant hand and twist the corkscrew handle counter-clockwise to remove the cork from the corkscrew.

7. Check the cork and wine:
   - Inspect the cork for any abnormalities or mold. If everything looks fine, your wine is ready to be served. In case you observe any abnormalities, it's best to consult a wine expert before proceeding.
   - If you used a wine napkin, give the bottle neck a gentle wipe to ensure there are no remaining foil or cork particles before pouring.

8. Pour and enjoy your wine:
   - Hold the wine bottle towards its base with your non-dominant hand, placing your thumb into the indentation at the bottom for better grip and control.
   - Position the wine glass at a slight angle and slowly pour the wine into the glass. Start at the bottom of the glass and gradually raise it upright as it fills up.
   - Enjoy your wine responsibly!

By following these detailed steps, you can open a bottle of wine efficiently and safely.
