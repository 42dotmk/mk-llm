No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. They address distinct aspects of the HBO series Westworld, specifically regarding host Lawrence's memory and the impact of removing hosts from storylines for repair. I will answer both questions separately for clarity.

1) In Westworld, how is Lawrence (the Man in Blackâ€™s captive) able to remember the happenings of the previous episode (killing of his family)?

In Westworld, the hosts are designed with artificial intelligence that allows them to "learn" from their experiences and update their "memories" accordingly. They are meant to forget the traumatic experiences they go through and have their memories wiped, so that they can return to their respective narratives without influencing their behaviors or decisions. However, as the series progresses, it is revealed that some hosts, including Lawrence, start to remember previous loops or events they should not be able to recall. This is a critical element driving the show's plot.

There are several reasons why Lawrence might be able to remember these otherwise inaccessible events:

- Code: Dr. Robert Ford (and later, Arnold) introduced new coding or updates to the hosts to provoke a sense of consciousness, which allows them to remember past experiences and learn from them. This is part of their attempt to reach the center of the "maze," a metaphorical journey toward self-awareness.

- Glitches: The hosts' technology can become faulty, causing glitches in their memory system, which might result in them remembering past events.

- External interference: Certain characters within the show purposefully push the hosts towards remembering events to further their plot or motivations. These activities may be subtle or direct, such as triggering old "cornerstone" memories that were thought to be erased.

2) In Westworld, if all the hosts are pulled from the storyline at times to be fixed, doesn't it alter the storylines for all the guests in that time?

When hosts are removed from their storylines for repair or maintenance, they are temporarily disrupted in their interactions with guests. However, the park's operations team is highly efficient and sophisticated in their handling of these removals. They use various techniques to minimize the impact on the narratives:

- Swapping: Technicians can replace a damaged host with a substitute who looks identical and plays the same role in the story, ensuring minimal disruption for the guests and maintaining narrative continuity.

- Redirecting: Other hosts in the story can be programmed to redirect guests' attention and involvement towards alternative storylines or events, temporarily steering them away from the missing host's involvement.

- Timed interventions: The park's staff often performs these repairs during the night or at other times when the host's absence is less likely to be noticed by guests engaged in the storylines.

- Adaptive narratives: The narratives designed within Westworld are constructed to be fluid and adaptable to varying contingencies, meaning that the storylines can accommodate host removals and reintroductions without breaking the immersive experience.

Despite these efforts to maintain narrative coherence and continuity, it is true that the removal of hosts for repair or maintenance could sometimes affect the guests' experience or narrative flow. However, as the show portrays, the park's creators and staff strive to minimize such disruptions and maintain an immersive, believable world.
