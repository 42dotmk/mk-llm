Genre: Horror, Thriller

Plot:

Act 1: Haunted Traumas

- The movie opens with Tommy (a 28-year-old man with a tormented past) waking up from a terrifying nightmare where he is being chased by the infamous killer, Jason Voorhees. Tommy's psychologist, Dr. Laura, suggests it's because of his unresolved guilt and fear from surviving Jason's killing spree years ago. Can he finally let go of his past?

- Tommy continues to experience vivid visions of the undead Jason, and he's convinced that the only way to end this cycle is to ensure that Jason's body is completely destroyed. Tommy does some research about the cemetery where Jason has been buried and discovers that his remains were never cremated.

- Taking matters into his own hands, Tommy enlists the help of his childhood friend, Hawes, who works as a cemetery caretaker, to help him exhume the body. Hawes, though reluctant, agrees to join Tommy in his quest to finally put an end to Jason's reign of terror.

Act 2: The Exhumation

- Tommy and Hawes start making preparations to dig up the grave. As they investigate the cemetery, they uncover clues about a dark history and a secret cult that worships Jason as an immortal entity. Is there more to this nightmare than they ever imagined?

- They find the grave where Jason's body is supposed to be buried but discover that the body is missing. A sudden and ominous storm starts brewing as they search for clues, and they soon learn that the cult has moved the body to a hidden location to revive Jason.

- Tommy and Hawes are determined to stop the cult's intentions at any cost. As they follow the tracks leading to the cult's hideout, they come across terrified locals, some who have lost family members to the wrath of Jason. Along the way, Tommy and Hawes gain unlikely allies, including a medium who claims to communicate with Jason's long-dead mother, Pamela Voorhees.

Act 3: The Final Confrontation

- As the group reaches the cult's hideout, they find that the members are in the process of conducting a horrifying ritual to resurrect Jason. The cult leader, Father Kane, is adamant that Jason's return will cleanse the world of sinners and non-believers.

- A final battle commences as Tommy, Hawes, and their group of allies fight the cult members and ultimately confront the reanimated Jason Voorhees. The fight is brutal and intense, with several allies losing their lives in the process.

- During the battle, Tommy realizes that the spirit of Pamela Voorhees is the key to defeating Jason. She tells them that cremating the remains of her son will sever his connection to the mortal world and end his terror.

- As the climax draws near, Tommy and Hawes manage to find the body of Jason and set it on fire, finally cremating his mortal remains. The undead Jason, sensing the demise of his corporeal form, charges towards them in a last-ditch effort to take Tommy down with him.

- In a thrilling ending, Tommy risks his own life to rid the world of Jason's menace once and for all. As the fire engulfs Jason's body, the supernatural tether binding him to the world is severed, and Jason vanishes before the horrified eyes of Tommy and the remaining survivors.
