[Question]Marcy is a makeup artist and has agreed to do some makeup for her friend's wedding. The only makeup she has limited stock of is lip gloss so she counts how many tubes she needs. Each tube of lip gloss will hold enough lip gloss for 3 people's makeup. Marcy decides to bring 6 tubs of lip gloss, each of which holds 2 tubes of lip gloss, and this will be the exact amount she needs for everyone's makeup. How many people is Marcy painting with makeup?
[Answer]Marcy is bringing 6 tubs of lip gloss * 2 tubes of lip gloss per tub of lip gloss = 12 tubes of lip gloss. So she must be applying makeup to 12 tubes of lip gloss * 3 people per tube of lip gloss = 36 people. The answer is 36.
Q: Jack is on the phone with a scammer who says the IRS will arrest Jack if he doesn't send them the codes from 6 $500 Best Buy gift cards and 9 $200 Walmart gift cards. After sending the codes for 1 Best Buy gift card and 2 Walmart gift cards, Jack wises up and hangs up. How many dollars' worth of gift cards can he still return?
A: First find the number of Best Buy gift cards Jack needs to return: 6 cards - 1 cards = 5 cards. Then multiply that number by the cost per card to find the total refund Jack gets from Best Buy: 5 cards * $500 / card = $2500. Then find the number of Walmart gift cards Jack needs to return: 9 cards - 2 cards = 7 cards. Then multiply that number by the cost per card to find the total refund Jack gets from Walmart: 7 cards * $200 / card = $1400. Then add the two refunds to find his total refund amount: $2500 + $1400 = $3900. The answer is 3900.
Question: Miriam is trying to exercise more and figures if she counts her exercises it will be encouraging to see her numbers go up. On Monday she does 5 push-ups. On Tuesday she does 7 push-ups. On Wednesday she does twice as many push-ups as the day before. On Thursday she does half the number of total pushups she already did that week. Finally, on Friday she does as many pushups as the total number she did over the previous four days. How many pushups does Miriam do on Friday?
Answer: On Monday Miriam does 5 push - ups + 7 push - ups on Tuesday = 12 push - ups on both days. On Wednesday she does twice as many push - ups as she did on Tuesday, 7 x 2 = 14 push - ups on Wednesday. Over the first 3 days, she did a total of 14 + 12 = 26 pushups. On Thursday Miriam did 1 / 2 the same number of total pushups she had already done that week, so she did 1 / 2 x 26 = 13 pushups on Thursday. On Friday she does as many push - ups as the total of what she had done over the previous four days, so she did 5 + 7 + 14 + 13 = 39 push - ups on Friday. The answer is 39.
