The highly-anticipated tournament will take place on the historic rolling greens of the Royal Troon Golf Club in Ayrshire, Scotland, providing a perfect backdrop of tradition and competitive spirit.

Danny Willett's triumphant win at the Masters earlier this year catapulted him into the global golfing spotlight.

As the reigning World Number One, Day will undoubtedly provide fierce competition for all participants as he enters the historic tournament aiming to add yet another major title to his already impressive resume. 

Completing the star-studded trio is Rickie Fowler, an influential figure in the new generation of young golfers. Since turning pro in 2009, Fowler has cemented his status as a household name in the sport, amassing numerous PGA Tour and European Tour wins along with a top-10 ranking. Known for his colorful personality and innovative style both on and off the course, Fowler attracts legions of fans eager to see what creative flair the 32-year-old American will bring to the Open Championship.

These three powerhouse golfers not only provide thrilling entertainment for fans of the sport but also inspire and motivate up-and-coming players as they navigate the challenges of the world’s oldest golf championship. The Open Championship, which has been held annually since 1860, is steeped in tradition and offers four days on which the best players in the world compete on immaculate, challenging courses.

However, the event is not only a showcase of extraordinary talent but also a testament to the perseverance and dedication necessary to succeed at the highest level of the sport.
