Act 1: Establishing the Characters

Jeffrey Bateman, a successful yet highly tormented businessman who ages in his late 40s, is increasingly discontent with his life. While he maintains an outward façade of control and efficiency, his mental state unravels as he struggles with a demanding career, a failing marriage, and a dark secret from his past.

Luis Martinez, a street-smart, charismatic hustler in his early 30s, is in search of an opportunity to advance his life. Despite his troubled childhood, Luis dreams of making a fresh start by leaving his checkered past behind. With ample charm and quick wit, he schemes and manipulates his way through New York City's elite social circles, becoming a mystery to those he encounters.

Act 2: The Deadly Plan and The Unlikely Meeting

As Jeffrey's life deteriorates, he becomes increasingly obsessed with exacting vengeance on his estranged wife, Linda. Overwhelmed by a deep-seated rage, he meticulously formulates a plan to murder Linda in an upscale New York City restaurant, 'The Ruby Chalice.'

On the night of the planned murder, Luis - with the help of an acquaintance - becomes employed in the restaurant as a waiter. He befriends the staff and integrates himself seamlessly into the establishment, strategically positioning himself to swindle and steal from the wealthy clientele.

As the night unfolds, Luis takes notice of Jeffrey, who is acting peculiar and exhibits erratic behavior while waiting for Linda. Curious and suspicious, Luis keeps a watchful eye on Jeffrey, sensing a potential danger to the restaurant and its patrons.

Act 3: The Climactic Encounter and The Unraveling Plan

Linda finally arrives, and Jeffrey's plan is set into motion. As they engage in a tense and uncomfortable meal, Jeffrey convinces Linda to meet him in the restroom for the sake of confidentiality. Luis, alert to the suspicious situation, excuses himself from the dining area.

In the restroom, Jeffrey prepares to kill Linda with a concealed knife but is interrupted when Luis barges in and witnesses the scene. A struggle ensues and ultimately culminates in Luis saving Linda's life, thwarting Jeffrey's plan. Amid the pandemonium, the restaurant staff and patrons become alerted to the situation and call the police.

In the aftermath, Jeffrey is arrested and taken into custody. As the police question the witnesses, they find out that Luis had been stealing credit card information from the restaurant patrons. Despite his criminal actions, Luis becomes an unlikely hero for saving Linda, and the restaurant’s management opts not to press charges.

Act 4: Resolution

With Jeffrey now facing the life-altering consequences of his actions and Luis, feeling guilty for his fraudulent activities, reflects on his life choices and decides to pursue a new path. Linda, forever changed by the harrowing experience, graciously thanks Luis and offers him an opportunity to leave his past behind by starting a new life in another city, working in her newly-established non-profit organization.

The movie concludes with Luis making amends to the restaurant staff and patrons, then leaves New York City to start anew. As the credits roll, a sobering lesson on the frailty and complexity of human nature is left for the audience to ponder.
