Question: A bird is building a nest from twigs. The bird has put twelve twigs together already to make a circle. For each twig it placed into the circle, it wants to weave in six more twigs to fill out the nest. It knows a tree that has dropped a third of the twigs it needs. How many twigs will the bird still need to find to finish its nest?
Answer: The bird wants 12 * 6 = 72 twigs to add to the nest. It knows a tree that has dropped 72 * 1 / 3 = 24 twigs. Thus, the bird will still need 72 - 24 = 48 twigs to finish the nest. The answer is 48.
[Question]Carl is hosting an open house for his new business. He knows 50 people will show up and hopes that another 40 people will randomly show up. He’s created 10 extravagant gift bags for the first 10 people who visit his shop. He’s made average gift bags for 20 people but needs to make enough for everyone who visits to have one. How many more bags does he need to make?
[Answer]He knows 50 people are showing up and he’s hoping 40 more people will drop in for a total of 50 + 40 = 90 people. He’s made 10 extravagant gift bags and 20 average bags for a total of 10 + 20 = 30 bags. He hopes 90 people will show up and has already made 30 bags so he needs to make 90 - 30 = 60 more gift bags. The answer is 60.
Q: In a factory, there are 300 employees. 200 of them earn $12 per hour. Of the rest, 40 of them earn $14 per hour. All others earn $17 per hour. What is the cost to employ all these people for one 8-hour long shift?
A: The cost of the 200 employees is 200 employees * $12 / employee / hour = $2400 per hour. The cost of the 40 employees is 40 employees * $14 / employee / hour = $560 per hour. The rest means 300 employees - 200 employees - 40 employees = 60 employees. These 60 employees' employment costs are at 60 employees * $17 / employee / hour = $1020 per hour. So in total all employees earn $2400 / hour + $560 / hour + $1020 / hour = $3980 / hour. During an 8 - hour shift, this cost would be at 8 hours * $3980 / hour = $31840. The answer is 31840.
Question: Timmy's parents have a 2 car garage, which has both cars inside it. Also inside is a riding lawnmower, a bicycle for Timmy as well as each of his parents, a tricycle for Timmy's little brother Joey, and a unicycle that Timmy's dad practices riding on. How many wheels in total are in this garage?
Answer: Each car in the garage has 4 wheels, for a total of 4 * 2 = 8 wheels. The riding lawnmower has 4 wheels, bringing the total up to 8 + 4 = 12 wheels. The bicycles have 2 wheels each and there are 3 of them, for 3 * 2 = 6 wheels, bringing the total to 12 + 6 = 18. The tricycle has 3 wheels, and the unicycle has 1 wheel, bringing the total up to 18 + 1 + 3 = 22 wheels. The answer is 22.
[Question]Before Cameron broke his right arm, he was able to type 10 words per minute on his phone.
