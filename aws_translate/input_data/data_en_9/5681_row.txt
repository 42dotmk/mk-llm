Q: A building has four floors with ten rooms each. Legacy has to clean each room, and it takes her 6 hours to clean one room. If she earns $15 per hour of work, calculate the total amount of money she makes from cleaning all the floors in the building.
A: Since the building has four floors with ten rooms each, the total number of rooms in the building is 4 * 10 = 40. If it takes Legacy 6 hours to clean each room, she will take 40 * 6 = 240 hours to clean all the rooms in the building. Since she is making $15 per hour of work, she will earn $15 * 240 = $3600 after cleaning all the rooms. The answer is 3600.
Question: There are 28 students in a classroom. Half of them have 5 notebooks each and the other half have 3 notebooks each. How many notebooks in total are in the classroom?
Answer: Half of the class consists of 28 students / 2 = 14 students. One half of the students have 14 students * 3 notebooks / student = 42 notebooks. The other half have 14 students * 5 notebooks / student = 70 notebooks. There are 42 notebooks + 70 notebooks = 112 notebooks in total in the classroom. The answer is 112.
[Question]Maria is a saleswoman at a flower shop. On the first day, she sold 30 tulips and 20 roses. The next day, she doubled the previous day's sales. On the third day, she sold only 10% of the tulips sold on the second day and 16 roses. The price of one tulip is $2 and one rose is $3. How much did Maria earn over these three days?
[Answer]On the second day, Maria sold 30 * 2 = 60 tulips. She also sold 20 * 2 = 40 roses the second day. On the third day, Maria sold only 10 / 100 * 60 = 6 tulips. Over these three days Maria sold 30 + 60 + 6 = 96 tulips. She also sold 20 + 40 + 16 = 76 roses. So on the tulips Maria earned 96 * 2 = $192. And on roses Maria earned 76 * 3 = $228. In total, over these three days, Maria has earned 192 + 228 = $420. The answer is 420.
Q: Faith went to a baking shop and bought flour that cost $5 and a cake stand that costs $28. She then gave the cashier two $20 bills and $3 in loose coins. How much change will she receive?
A: Faith must pay $28 + $5 = $33 for the flour and cake stand. Her two $20 bills amount to $20 x 2 = $40. So, she gave the cashier a total of $40 + $3 = $43. Hence, her change is $43 - $33 = $10. The answer is 10.
Question: It took an alligator named Paul 4 hours to walk from his home at the River Nile to the Nile Delta. On the return journey, Paul traveled with six other alligators, the journey taking 2 more hours than Paul took to walk to the Nile Delta, to reach their home at the River Nile. What's the combined time the alligators walked?
Answer: If on the return journey to its home, the alligator took 2 more hours than it took to travel to the Nile Delta, Paul took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to travel back to its home. The total time Paul took to travel from its home to the Nile Delta and back is 6 + 4 = 10. On his return journey, Paul traveled with six other alligators, and since each alligator traveled for six hours up the Nile to their home, they took a total of 6 * 6 = 36 hours to do so. Together with Paul, all the alligators took 10 + 36 = 46 hours traveling between Nile Delta and up the Nile. The answer is 46.
