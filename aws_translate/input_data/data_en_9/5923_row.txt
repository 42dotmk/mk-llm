c). couch had sharp edges hidden beneath its frame.

Tanya never imagined her cozy living room would turn into a crime scene of sorts. She had always taken pride in her sense of style and taste. The lush white carpet, the elegant gray couch and the charming wooden chair had been her carefully chosen ensemble. Now, she stared at the deep scratches on the pristine carpet, her heart sinking. Somehow, someway, the couch was the culprit.

As she examined the jagged lines, she recalled her initial hypothesis about the chair being the offender. It had an antique design with intricately carved wooden legs. Yet, its soft, velvety cushions concealed its true nature, as Tanya discovered that the chair was significantly lighter. The sheer effort necessary to create such deep, menacing scratches on the carpet indicated that the more robust couch was likely responsible.

Moreover, a closer inspection of both the couch and the chair revealed their construction. The chair was indeed old, but the wood was properly sanded, polished, and lacked any uneven or sharp surfaces. On the other hand, the couch had a heavier metal frame hidden beneath its chic gray upholstery. Its modern looks and plump cushions had instantly drawn her to the piece, but little did she know, lurking beneath the frame were sharp, metal edges.

She couldn't help but wonder how she had overlooked such an alarming detail. The memories of her shopping excursions came flooding back, reminding her of the day she had brought the couch home. The hurried deliverymen had carelessly dragged the couch into the living room, paying no heed to the damage they were inflicting on the delicate carpet.

At the time, she had been entirely focused on rearranging her living space, her excitement building as she planned the room's layout. Tanya couldn't recall paying much attention to the bottom of the couch, so enamored by its beautiful exterior. Now faced with the daunting task of repairing both the couch and the damage it had caused, her initial enthusiasm was replaced by a surge of frustration and regret.

Determined to rectify her mistakes, Tanya began her search for a professional furniture repair service. She knew the couch's sharp edges had to be addressed before the damage spiraled further out of control. As for the carpet, she scanned through a series of online tutorials, contemplating whether she should fix it herself or opt for professional help. She came to the conclusion that the scale of the scratches was beyond her expertise, and so, reluctantly, added carpet repair to her growing list of things to do.

Meanwhile, she couldn't help but think about her response to the entire ordeal. A part of her felt angry at the negligence of the manufacturers; they had done an inadequate job of sealing the couch's dangerous edges. On the other hand, she also felt responsible for overlooking such a crucial detail. In retrospect, her hasty decisions and neglect of thorough investigations had played a significant role in this debacle.

As the days turned into weeks, Tanya proceeded to resolve the damages inflicted on her beloved living room. Lessons were learned, and she realized how important it is to pay attention to even the smallest of details. By the time the couch and carpet were restored to their former glory, Tanya vowed that in the future, she would not fall prey to superficial appearances. With this newfound wisdom, she continued to grow and evolve, cherishing her stylish living room which now held not only elegance but also a valuable life lesson.
