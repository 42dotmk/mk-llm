Title: The Harsh Reality of Vaping: New York Teenager Suffers Severe Injuries from E-Cigarette Explosion

In what could be described as a terrible turn of events, a New York teenager, Leor Domatov, aged 14, faced a horrifying anti-vaping experience and learned a life-altering lesson. An e-cigarette exploded in Domatov's face, causing devastating injuries, exposing the hazards of vaping and the risks associated with e-cigarettes.

Leor Domatov and his friends took a bus to the Kings Plaza Mall in Brooklyn to spend some time engaging in leisurely activities. However, the events that transpired changed Domatov's life forever. Upon entering the mall, the group of friends stopped at a vaping kiosk called Plaza Vapes, situated near the mall's entrance. Shockingly, there was no restriction on the teenager handling the products, with the kiosk clerk permitting him to access and experiment with them, as reported by the New York Daily News. 

Unbeknownst to them, this decision would have disastrous consequences. As the kiosk clerk connected the wrong battery to a vaporizer cartridge, the device exploded. The explosion partially blinded Domatov, inflicting severe eye injuries, piercing his corneas in both eyes. Moreover, the young teenager sustained burns to his hands, with one of them having a large gash as described by the Daily News. Currently, Domatov has no visibility in his left eye, only retaining a minimal amount of vision in his right eye.

The incident has raised numerous questions on the regulations and safety measures surrounding vaping kiosks and e-cigarette usage in the state of New York. The family's attorney highlighted the responsibilities that fall on both the mall and the kiosk management, stating, "The duty falls on Kings Plaza and the kiosk owner to make sure there are signs in place to warn the children."

It is critical to note that it is illegal for individuals under 18 to buy e-cigarettes in New York state, with New York City enforcing an even stricter policy banning e-cigarette usage for anyone under 21. Despite such regulations being in place, the Plaza Vapes kiosk negligently allowed the young teenager to handle their products, leading to this tragic incident.

Unfortunately, Domatov's case is not the first instance where e-cigarette users have faced severe health hazards due to device explosions. As vaping continues to gain popularity, particularly amongst young adults, the risks associated with e-cigarette usage must be taken seriously. E-cigarettes have been under scrutiny for their overall safety, chemical composition, and the claims surrounding them being a healthier alternative to traditional cigarettes. Notably, vaping has been made illegal on all US flights to curb the potential risks it may pose during air travel.

This incident serves as a stark reminder to be cautious while handling e-cigarettes and to spread awareness about the dangers of vaping. Furthermore, it should prompt kiosk owners and mall managements across the country to ensure strict adherence to regulations, preventing minors from purchasing and handling potentially hazardous vaping products.

It is essential to strike a balance between enjoying leisure activities and considering the risks associated with those activities. For young teenagers like Leor Domatov, this lesson has come at an incredibly high cost. The increasing importance of awareness and education surrounding vaping cannot be emphasized enough to safeguard the well-being of unsuspecting individuals in the future.
