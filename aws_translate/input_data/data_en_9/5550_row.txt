The most logical next event after purchasing a money order for a certain amount at a USPS outlet would be to mail the money order to the intended recipient. Here is a detailed and step-by-step guide on how to successfully send the money order:

1. Determine the desired amount: Before visiting the USPS outlet, it is crucial to know the exact amount of money you wish to send through the money order. This will ensure a smooth transaction and help avoid any confusion later.

2. Visit the USPS outlet: Locate your nearest USPS outlet and go there to purchase the money order. Make sure you carry sufficient cash, a debit card, or traveler's checks to cover the value of the money order and any associated fees. Keep in mind that credit cards are not accepted for purchasing money orders at USPS locations.

3. Fill out the money order form: Once the money order has been obtained, it will have sections for you to fill out. These sections generally require the following information:

   a. Payee's name: Write the full name of the person or organization to whom the money order is being sent. This helps ensure the money order is only cashed or deposited by the intended recipient.

   b. Your name and address: Fill in your full name and address, which allows the recipient to know that the money order came from you and provides a record in case any issues arise later.

   c. Additional information: Some money orders have a section for memo or additional information, where you can write the purpose of the payment (for instance, rent, loan repayment, etc.).

   d. Sign the money order: Sign the 'purchaser' or 'sender' section, making it valid for the recipient.

4. Retain the receipt stub: A detachable receipt stub is typically provided with the money order. Keep it in a safe place, as it serves as proof of the transaction and may be needed if the money order is lost or you need to track its status.

5. Prepare the money order and accompanying documents for mailing: Place the completed money order in an envelope addressed to the recipient. It's a good idea to also include a note or letter explaining the purpose of the money order and any specific instructions. Seal the envelope securely.

6. Mail the envelope: Go to the post office to mail the envelope containing the money order. It is advisable to use a trackable mailing service such as Certified Mail, Priority Mail, or Registered Mail to ensure the safe and timely delivery of the money order to the intended recipient. Moreover, you can also purchase insurance for the mailing in case of potential loss or damage.

7. Track the mailing: After mailing the money order, track its progress through the USPS website (if you used a trackable mailing service) or by contacting USPS customer service. This will help you stay informed about the status of your money order and provide peace of mind.

8. Follow up with the recipient: Once the money order has been successfully delivered, confirm its receipt with the intended recipient. This is an essential step to ensure the intended person or organization obtained the money order and deposited or cashed it accordingly. If there are any issues, having this communication will make it easier to resolve them.

In conclusion, the most logical next event after purchasing a money order is to send it to the intended recipient by following the detailed steps outlined above. This will ensure that the money order reaches the correct person or organization securely and serves its desired purpose.
