The Fight:

From the very beginning of the match, Andrew Selby, brother of former world featherweight champion Lee Selby, looked comfortable and in control of the fight against his Filipino opponent, Jake Bornea.

It was only in the seventh round when the inevitable happened. Selby's relentless pressure and precise punching had taken its toll on Bornea, and a powerful combination sent the Filipino reeling to the canvas. Though Bornea managed to regain his footing, the referee wisely deemed him unfit to continue and called an end to the match, declaring Selby the winner via TKO.
