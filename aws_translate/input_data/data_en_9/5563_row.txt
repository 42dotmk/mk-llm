Title: Saido Berahino: From the "Naughty Chair" to Rising Star - A Path Towards Redemption

Introduction:

Saido Berahino, the talented West Bromwich Albion striker, has had his share of ups and downs in his career. In the past, his controversial remarks and rebellious attitude have often overshadowed his skills on the field. One such incident was when his then-manager, Tony Pulis, placed him "on the naughty chair," following Berahino's public statement of wanting to move on to "bigger things." This article will delve into the details of that incident and reveal how Berahino managed to turn his career around despite making headlines for the wrong reasons.

Main Body:

The infamous "naughty chair" incident took place in 2015 when Saido Berahino was still making a name for himself at West Brom. His performances during the previous season had caught the eye of several top Premier League clubs. While it is natural for any ambitious player to dream of playing for a more celebrated team, Berahino's public expression of his desire to move away from The Hawthorns only served to alienate him from his manager and teammates. Instead of garnering support, Berahino found himself in the bad books of Tony Pulis, the West Brom manager at the time, who seemed visibly disappointed by the striker's lack of commitment towards his current employer.

The disgruntled manager decided to teach Berahino a lesson and assigned him to the "naughty chair" situated in the far corner of the dressing room, a measure to humiliate and discipline the young forward. The implications of such a move sent a clear message to Berahino â€“ either conform to the rules and respect the team or risk being an outcast in his own dressing room. This was not the first time Berahino had faced disciplinary action; he had been previously axed from the squad due to his attitude and poor time-keeping.

However, Berahino's exile did not last long, as he eventually garnered the humility needed to resolve the matter with his manager. Recognizing the need to disassociate his off-pitch controversies from his on-field performances, Berahino worked tirelessly to win back the respect of his manager and teammates. This paid off as the striker not only regained his place in the West Brom team, but gradually progressed into an essential asset for the club.

Fast forward to the present, and Saido Berahino stands as a symbol of redemption. After overcoming various challenges throughout his career, Berahino has emerged as an influential figure in the world of football. His performances with West Brom ultimately led him to secure a move to Stoke City in January 2017. Although his time with Stoke was initially marred by off-field controversies, Berahino has since managed to find his footing. Most recently, he has been showcasing his form with Belgian club Zulte Waregem, where his goal-scoring prowess has truly come to the fore.

Conclusion:

The story of Saido Berahino serves as a testament to the importance of discipline, humility, and perseverance in the world of professional football. The "naughty chair" incident may have been one of the lowest points in the striker's career, but it can also be seen as a turning point, a moment that forced Berahino to reassess his priorities and regain focus. Presently, with his excellent performances on the field and a positive attitude off it, Berahino stands tall as a rising star who has learned from his mistakes, determined to move forward and make his mark on the world of football.
