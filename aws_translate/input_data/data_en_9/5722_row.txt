Yes, the statement provided is accurate in highlighting the key differences between the ijāzat al-tadrīs in Islamic schools and the licentia docendi in European universities. To further elaborate on this topic, let us explore the contexts and processes of obtaining these teaching licenses in both Islamic and European educational systems.

In Islamic Schools:

The ijāzat al-tadrīs (permission to teach) was a teaching license granted in Islamic schools and institutions, particularly in madrasas, which were centers of learning for various subjects such as law, theology, philosophy, and sciences. This license played an essential role in the educational system of the Islamic world, as it validated the scholarly qualifications of the recipient and allowed them to impart knowledge to students.

The process of obtaining an ijāzat al-tadrīs was not standardized or institutionalized, and it varied depending on the scholar, subject, and the period. Generally, students studied under the guidance of one or more scholars, usually by attending their lectures and engaging in discussions. After a significant amount of time and demonstrating proficiency in a particular subject, the student could request the ijāzat al-tadrīs from their teacher. The teacher, acting in their capacity as an individual scholar, would then decide whether to grant the license based on their assessment of the student's qualifications.

Once granted, the ijāzat al-tadrīs would usually be documented in a written certificate or ijāza. The document often included the name of the recipient, the subject or field of study, the name of the scholar issuing the license, and sometimes even the names of previous scholars in the chain of transmission, establishing the teacher's scholarly lineage. With this license, the recipient was authorized to teach the specific subject referenced in the ijāza within the Islamic educational system.

In European Universities:

The licentia docendi, or the permission to teach, was a teaching license granted in medieval European universities. The process of obtaining this license was more formalized and institutionalized compared to the ijāzat al-tadrīs. Rather than being solely determined by an individual scholar-teacher, the licentia docendi was conferred by the chief official of the university, who represented the institution and the collective faculty. This process was an integral part of the rigorous academic structure that had developed in European universities at the time.

To obtain a licentia docendi, a candidate would typically have to complete an extensive course of studies at a university, specializing in a subject such as theology, law, medicine, or arts. The candidate would then go through a series of examinations or disputations to demonstrate their mastery of the subject matter. Upon successful completion of the rigorous examination process, the candidate would receive the licentia docendi, granted by the university authority on behalf of the institution and the collective faculty.

In conclusion, while both the ijāzat al-tadrīs and the licentia docendi served as teaching licenses in the Islamic and European educational systems, respectively, their processes and contexts differed significantly. The ijāzat al-tadrīs relied on the individual scholar-teacher's judgment in assessing a candidate's qualifications, whereas the licentia docendi was based on a collective decision made by the university officials, representing the institutional subject matter experts and faculties.
