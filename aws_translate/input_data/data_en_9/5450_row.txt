Bellefonte, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- For the first week of Jerry Sandusky's child sex trial, eight young men held jurors spellbound with testimony about a sports hero they say groped them in the car, soaped them in the shower and sexually assaulted them on a basement waterbed. How do you come back from something like that? Sandusky's defense attorneys, Joe Amendola and Karl Rominger, responded this week with rapid-fire rounds of testimony; 29 witnesses took the stand in little more than two days -- including 11 character witnesses in a single hour. The defense also chipped away at the character and motives of the alleged victims, sparing no one: not the young accusers, not their families and certainly not the cops.

As the trial proceeded, the prosecution rebutted the defense's claims by bringing forward additional witnesses and evidence, including a forensic psychiatrist who testified about the psychological impact of sexual abuse on the victims. Prosecutors also presented emails and text messages between Sandusky and the alleged victims, further corroborating their claims of abuse.

In the midst of these emotionally charged testimonies, the jury heard from several individuals who worked closely with Sandusky at Penn State, including assistant coaches and staff, who described his behavior around young boys as "suspicious" and "inappropriate." These testimonies cast a shadow over Sandusky's reputation and questioned the suitability of his role as a mentor and youth sports coach.

As the trial reached its conclusion, both the defense and prosecution delivered their closing arguments. Amendola and Rominger focused on highlighting inconsistencies in the testimonies of the alleged victims, accusing the police of investigative misconduct and harassment, and questioning the financial motives behind the accusers' claims. The prosecution, on the other hand, painted a disturbing picture of Sandusky as a predator who used his prestigious position at Penn State to exploit vulnerable young boys. They urged the jury to consider the overwhelming evidence against Sandusky and the compelling testimonies of the eight young men who had the courage to come forward.

After days of deliberation, the jury found Jerry Sandusky guilty on numerous counts of child sexual abuse. Sandusky, who remained stoic as the verdict was read, was immediately remanded into custody to begin serving his sentence. The verdict brought a sense of closure to the victims and their families, while sparking a broader conversation about the importance of vigilance against child sexual abuse and the need for institutions like Penn State to prioritize the well-being of children over their interests or reputation.

In the wake of the trial, Penn State faced criticism for their handling of the allegations against Sandusky, leading to the firing of numerous top-level administrators, including the university's president and the legendary football coach, Joe Paterno. The trial also led to renewed interest in legislation supporting victims of child sexual abuse and extending the statute of limitations for such cases, with the hope that other victims would find the strength to share their experiences and seek justice.

As the dust settled on this harrowing case, the community of Bellefonte and Penn State University were left grappling with the dark side of a celebrated sports hero and the legacy of a man who championed the welfare of children, but was ultimately revealed to be their worst nightmare.
