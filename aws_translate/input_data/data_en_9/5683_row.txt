Question 1:
The placement scene at the College of Engineering and Technology (CET), Bhubaneswar, is quite impressive, particularly for top-performing branches like computer science and engineering, information technology, and electronics and communication engineering. To better analyze the placement, we can look at different aspects such as its placement cell, the recruiters visiting the campus, and the salary packages offered to the students.

CET Bhubaneswar has a dedicated Training and Placement Cell that is responsible for grooming the students, coordinating with industries, and arranging for internship and placement opportunities. The cell conducts career counseling, workshops, seminars, and industry interactions to refine the students' industry-readiness. They also organize pre-placement talks, in which companies provide insights into the roles and responsibilities along with various technologies and skills required to excel in different job profiles.

Leading companies and organizations participate in the campus recruitment process at CET Bhubaneswar, hiring students for diverse roles across sectors. Some of the reputed recruiters include Infosys, TCS, Wipro, Accenture, Tech Mahindra, Cognizant, Samsung, Larsen & Toubro, Vedanta, and many others. Placement activities at the college are organized annually to help both undergraduate and postgraduate students secure suitable jobs in their respective fields.

In terms of salary packages, students at CET Bhubaneswar receive offers that are on par with those at other well-known engineering colleges in the country. The average salary package usually falls between INR 3.5 lakhs to INR 6 lakhs per annum, while the highest packages can go up to INR 18-20 lakhs per annum. The final packages offered depend on the role, company, and the performance of the candidate during the selection process.

Question 2:
To determine whether you can get the Information Technology (IT) branch at CET Bhubaneswar with an All India Rank (AIR) of 110,000, we need to look at certain factors such as exam cut-offs, seat availability, and applicants' performance in the admission process.

Cut-offs are generally determined by factors such as the number of applicants, the seat availability in a given branch, and the previous years' trends. Keeping these factors in mind and based on past trends, it can be challenging to secure a seat in the IT branch with an AIR of 110,000, as CET Bhubaneswar is a reputable engineering college with significant competition for available seats.

However, it is important to remember that cut-off ranks can change from year to year, and admission processes like counseling and quota systems may influence your chance of securing a seat. Additionally, if you belong to a reserved category, you may have a higher probability due to the distinct allocation of seats for such students.

Now, considering the options provided:

A) No
B) Yes

It is more likely that the answer to the question "Can I get IT in CET Bhubaneswar with AIR 110,000?" is 'A) No,' as it can be quite challenging to secure a seat with that rank.

In summary, while the placement scene in CET Bhubaneswar is impressive, securing a seat in the IT branch with an AIR of 110,000 might be difficult. Of course, various factors such as cut-offs, reservation, and seat allocation during counseling may impact your ability to secure a seat in IT. The answers to both questions, therefore, are not the same because they address different aspects of the college experience.
