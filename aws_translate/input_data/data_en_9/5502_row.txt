children - and has since evolved into a thriving community and safe haven for these young survivors. Nizma Scoffield, driven by her compassion and determination, took on the monumental task of not only providing these children with a roof over their heads but also working tirelessly to help them heal from the unspeakable trauma they had experienced.

In the immediate aftermath of the tsunami, which claimed the lives of more than 230,000 people across 14 countries, aid organizations from around the world arrived to provide relief in the form of food, water, and medical supplies. However, with countless children left orphaned, it was clear that longer-term solutions were needed to care for and support these young victims. This is where Nizma's vision for her orphanage took root.

Initially, the orphanage was set up in a temporary location, providing basic necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter for the children. As the number of orphans grew, Nizma searched for ways to secure permanent land and facilities to ensure their long-term care and education. This was no easy task, as funding and resources were scarce in the wake of the disaster. However, thanks to the generosity of donors and the unwavering support of volunteers and community members, the orphanage was eventually established in a permanent location.

Today, the orphanage has become a vital sanctuary for these children, offering much more than just their basic needs. Along with providing housing, food, and clothing, the orphanage emphasizes education and personal development, ensuring that the children have the tools and resources they need to overcome their pasts and eventually lead successful, fulfilled lives.

Through the ongoing support of the staff and volunteers, the children have been nurtured and guided back to a sense of normalcy despite the trauma. Many have even gained the courage to face their fears of water and rain, taking part in swimming lessons and activities that promote both mental and physical healing.

Alongside their formal education, the children at the orphanage also receive psychological support to help them cope with their grief and loss. The team of dedicated caregivers and therapists work closely with the children to address the emotional scars left by the tsunami, using various therapeutic techniques and activities that encourage self-expression and emotional release.

Moreover, the orphanage also strives to help the children maintain a connection to their cultural heritage and traditions. By cultivating a sense of community and preserving their shared history, the orphans are able to develop a sense of identity and belonging, which is essential for their emotional healing and self-esteem.

Over the past ten years, Nizma Scoffield's orphanage has saved the lives and restored hope to over 100 children who lost everything in the Boxing Day tsunami. Thanks to her unwavering commitment and the dedication of her team, these children have been given a second chance at life and the opportunity to grow into strong, resilient adults.

As the orphanage continues to thrive and fulfill its mission, it stands as a testament to the power of human compassion and the importance of providing care, support, and hope to those who have lost so much. Through the efforts of Nizma Scoffield and her team, the orphans can now face their futures with strength, confidence, and optimism, knowing that they have a loving and supportive community to guide them every step of the way.
