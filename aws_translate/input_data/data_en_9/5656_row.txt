Once upon a time, on the distant planet of Krypton, the inhabitants lived a peaceful and prosperous life. They were highly advanced in technology and science, which they used to make their lives better. However, their hunger for resources soon led them to the brink of destruction. Krypton's core, being rich in a precious element, attracted the attention of miners who exploited it without considering the consequences. It was not long before the relentless mining began to destabilize the planet's core, leading to catastrophic tectonic events and an impending apocalyptic scenario.

Amidst this crisis, the planet's council convened an urgent assembly to discuss possible solutions. Many brilliant minds proposed various strategies, but none seemed to hold the key to the salvation of Krypton. It was during this chaotic time that a highly respected scientist named Jor-El emerged as a voice of reason. His research had long predicted the danger of mining Krypton's core, and he had been hard at work attempting to devise a suitable plan of action. In light of the rapidly deteriorating situation, the council decided to entrust Jor-El with the control of the genetics codex, which held the entire biological knowledge and heritage of the Kryptonian race.

Jor-El worked tirelessly to find a way to save his people. However, he soon discovered that Krypton's core was beyond salvation, and that the destruction of their planet was imminent. Desperate to preserve the Kryptonian legacy, Jor-El conceived a bold plan to entrust the future of his race to his infant son, Kal-El. He devised a preprogrammed spacecraft that would carry the young child to safety on a distant, habitable planet.

When the time came, the selfless Jor-El prepared to say goodbye to his beloved wife and son. He knew that staying behind meant sacrificing his life, but his love for his people and hopes for his son steeled his resolve. Before parting, he placed the genetic codex into his sonâ€™s escape vessel, ensuring that the essence of Krypton would live on in the blood of his child. As the planet's destruction drew near, Jor-El launched the spacecraft carrying his precious cargo into the vast reaches of space.

Following Jor-El's meticulously calculated coordinates, the spacecraft journeyed across the cosmos and arrived on a small, blue-green planet called Earth. It crash-landed, as designed, near a small Kansas town called Smallville. Here, a kind couple named Jonathan and Martha Kent, who were unable to have children of their own, discovered the infant Kal-El. They loved and raised him as their own, and named him Clark.

As Clark grew up, he realized that he was unlike other humans. Burdened by the knowledge of the fate that had befallen his true home, and feeling immense guilt for being the sole survivor of Krypton, he decided that he needed to find a new purpose in life. He knew that he possessed extraordinary abilities given to him by his Kryptonian heritage, and he wanted to use these powers to help others.

Thus, Clark set out on a journey around the world. He learned about different cultures, discovered new ways of thinking, and was inspired by the resilience and ingenuity of humankind. During his travels, he realized that he could use his great power to protect Earth, the planet that had taken him in and given him a second chance at life. And so, the once lost and guilt-ridden young man from a distant world embraced his destiny and became Earth's greatest protector, the iconic superhero known as Superman.
