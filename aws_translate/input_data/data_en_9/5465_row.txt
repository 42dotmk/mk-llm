it was the first time Megan had shown interest in learning about the celestial objects in the night sky. The Pleiades star cluster, also known as the Seven Sisters, M45, or even Subaru in Japanese, is one of the most easily identifiable and well-known star clusters visible to the naked eye. The enthusiasm in Megan's eyes shone just as brightly as the stars, and this sight, Amy knew, would truly captivate her newfound interest.

The Pleiades star cluster is located in the constellation of Taurus, approximately 444 light-years away from Earth. It is a prominent sight in the winter sky of the Northern Hemisphere and can be found by first identifying the familiar constellation of Orion. From Orion's belt, a line extending through the bright star Aldebaran (also part of Taurus) leads directly to this enchanting cluster.

Amy began by explaining the mythology behind the Pleiades, which varies across different cultures. The most common story is derived from Greek mythology, which tells of the seven sisters pursued by the hunter Orion, who were transformed into doves by Zeus and placed in the night sky to escape his advances.

She then went on to describe the scientific nature of the star cluster. Formed from the same cosmic cloud around 100 million years ago, Pleiades consists mainly of young, hot, blue-white stars, which have yet to exhaust their reserves of hydrogen fuel. Despite being referred to as the Seven Sisters, the star cluster contains over 800 stars, but only a handful are visible to the naked eye. The apparent member stars are Alcyone, Atlas, Electra, Maia, Merope, Taygeta, and Pleione, with each name rooted in the Greek mythology Amy had previously mentioned.

Amy also shared her knowledge about the nebulosity surrounding the Pleiades star cluster, which is composed of fine dust particles that reflect the radiant blue light from the stars. These dust particles are the remnants of the vast molecular cloud that birthed the stars, and the ongoing interaction between the stars and dust creates the glowing phenomenon observed in long-exposure photographs.

As Amy conveyed her passion for astronomy to Megan, they both marveled at the indigo splendor of the Pleiades star cluster in the crisp winter sky. They discussed its importance in ancient cultures, as it was often used as a celestial calendar and a reference point for navigation. The two young women stood there, immersed in their newfound celestial bond, as each star of the Pleiades twinkled back at them like a sisterhood traversing space and time.

With each minute spent beneath the cold but captivating night sky, Megan became more and more awestruck by the magnificence of the stars. Amy shared more fascinating astronomical facts and folklore, delving deeper into the history and science that enveloped them on that crystal-clear night.

Thus began Megan's lifelong interest in astronomy, initiated by her first enchanting encounter with the Pleiades star cluster. And as future celestial events unfolded, like meteor showers, eclipses, and planetary conjunctions, Megan and Amy would come together many times more, united by their love for the cosmos and the unending desire to learn and explore its secrets. It became a ritual for them, a reminder of the night their friendship had grown stronger under the spell of the Seven Sisters. Together, they fostered a love for mankind's earliest obsession: understanding the wonders and mysteries written in the ever-expanding tome that is the night sky.
