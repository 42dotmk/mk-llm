Victor Hugo's detailed and picturesque descriptions of the city transport the reader back in time while connecting current themes with past events, underscoring the cyclical nature of human experience. My only critique is the occasional lengthy digression, which can disrupt the flow of the story."

3. Broadway Buff: 3.5/5 Stars

"Having seen and enjoyed the musical adaptation of 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame,' I was eager to read the source material. While I appreciated the vivid imagery and captivating narrative of the original, it is markedly darker than its theatrical counterpart, as some of the characters' motivations and relationships are significantly different.

The complex relationships between the characters are what truly drive the plot, as their impossibly tangled destinies come together to form a tragic romance that has continued to enchant readers for centuries."

5. Philosophical Bookworm: 5/5 Stars
