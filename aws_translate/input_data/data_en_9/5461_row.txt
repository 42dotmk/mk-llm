Q: Paul lives in a 5th story apartment. He makes 3 trips out from and back to his apartment throughout the day each day of a week. How many feet does he travel vertically in total over the week if each story is 10 feet tall?
A: Since Paul makes 3 trips per day, and each trip involves going both down and up, this means he travels the full vertical distance of his apartment complex 3 * 2 = 6 times a day. Since there are 7 days in a week, this means he makes this trip 6 * 7 = 42 times a week. Since each story is 10 feet tall, that means with 5 stories he travels 5 * 10 = 50 feet each trip. Since he made 42 trips of 50 feet each, this means he traveled 50 * 42 = 2100 feet in a week. The answer is 2100.
Question: Mr. Sergio is a fruit grower producing apples, mangoes and oranges. In a particular season, the total produce of apples was twice the total produce of mangoes, and the total produce of oranges was 200 kg more than that of mangoes. If his farm produced 400 kg of mangoes and he sold the fruits at $50 per kg, calculate the total amount of money he got in that season.
Answer: If the total production of mangoes was 400, then orange production was 400 + 200 = 600 kg of oranges. Since apple production was twice the total production of mangoes, Mr. Sergio had 2 * 400 = 800 kg of apples. The total quantity of fruits produced at Mr. Sergio's farm is 800 kg of apples + 600 kg of oranges + 400 kg of mangoes = 1800 kg of fruits. If Mr. Sergio sold the fruits at $50 per kg, his total income from the sales is 1800 * $50 = $90000. The answer is 90000.
[Question]At the Mystic Aquarium, sharks are fed four buckets of fish each day. The dolphins are fed half as many buckets as the sharks while the other sea animals are fed five times as many buckets as the sharks. How many weeks will 546 buckets of fish last?
[Answer]The dolphins are fed 4 / 2 = 2 buckets of fish each day. The sea animals are fed 4 x 5 = 20 buckets of fish each day. So, the Mystic Aquarium needs 4 + 2 + 20 = 26 buckets of fish each day. Thus in a week, it needs 26 x 7 = 182 buckets of fish. Therefore, 546 buckets of fish will last for 546 / 182 = 3 weeks. The answer is 3.
Q: At A.T. Cross Luxury Pens, a pencil sells at twenty-five cents while a pen sells at fifteen cents. Bowen buys 40 pens and 2/5 times more pencils than pens from A.T. Cross Luxury Pens. Calculate the total amount of money Bowen spends.
A: Bowen bought 2 / 5 * 40 pens = 16 more pencils than pens. The total number of pencils that he bought is 40 pencils + 16 pencils = 56 pencils. If each pencil costs twenty - five cents, the total amount of money he spent on pencils is 56 pencils * $0.25 / pencil = $14. On pens, Bowen spent $0.15 / pen * 40 pens = $6. The total amount of money Bowen spent is $14 + $6 = $20. The answer is 20.
Question: Cary walks 3 miles round-trip to the grocery store, where he buys and eats a candy bar with 200 calories. If Cary burns 150 calories per mile walked, what's Cary's net calorie deficit (expressed as a positive number)?
Answer: First, find how many calories the walk burned by multiplying the calories burned per mile by the number of miles Cary walked: 3 miles * 150 calories / mile = 450 calories. Then subtract the calories Corey ate to find the net calories Cary burned: 450 calories - 200 calories = 250 calories. The answer is 250.
