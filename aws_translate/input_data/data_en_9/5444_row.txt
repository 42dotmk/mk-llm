online ads campaign had not been as effective as he had hoped. He chose to distribute the flyers in strategic locations around the city, where potential clientele frequented. These locations included coffee shops, gyms, malls, and public transportation hubs. Maurice knew that in order for the new salon to thrive, he needed to reach the right audience: people who are interested in fashion, looking for a change, or simply in need of a convenient salon experience.

To make the flyers more attractive, Maurice collaborated with a local graphic designer to create an eye-catching layout with intriguing visuals, ensuring the salon's services and promotions stood out. The flyers showcased the salon's chic interior, skilled staff, and a variety of hair and beauty services. In addition, the flyers included a limited time promotional offer - a 20% discount on the first visit as an extra incentive for potential clients to give his salon a try. 

Maurice also decided to share the flyers with his family, friends, and established customers, encouraging them to spread the word about the new salon and refer their networks. Word-of-mouth marketing has always been a powerful tool; by leveraging personal connections, Maurice was optimistic about attracting new customers and securing repeat visits. 

To gauge the impact of the flyers campaign, Maurice implemented a system to track the number of new customers acquired from the promotional offer. He made a note of asking clients how they had heard about the salon and diligently recorded this information. This would not only help Maurice evaluate the success of the flyer distribution but also provide valuable insights on which locations and demographics were most responsive to his marketing efforts.

Moreover, Maurice recognized the importance of social media in today's business landscape and, although he had canceled the online ads, he continued to be active on social media platforms to promote the salon. He shared images of the flyer on the salon's official Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter accounts and invited his followers to like, share, and repost the content. This approach, combined with regularly showcasing his stylists' work on various social media channels, generated a buzz around the salon, piquing people's curiosity and earning new clients.

Within a few weeks, Maurice began to notice an increase in walk-ins and appointments, as well as a rise in positive online reviews from satisfied customers. The salon's reputation started to grow, and soon, it became the talk of the town. Encouraged by these results, Maurice decided to set up a loyalty program to retain the newfound customer base and reward them for their continued support. 

He developed a rewards system where customers would earn points for every service they received, which could later be redeemed for discounts on future visits. Additionally, he initiated a referral program, where both the referrer and referee would receive a discount on their next service. This not only encouraged client retention but also facilitated continuous word-of-mouth promotion.

In conclusion, Maurice's strategic decision to cancel the ineffective online ads and switch to a more targeted and personal method of promoting his salon proved to be successful. By leveraging the power of flyers, word-of-mouth marketing, and social media, Maurice attracted and retained new clients, consequently securing the growth and success of his salon in an increasingly competitive market.
