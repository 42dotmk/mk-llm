Q: Jack has 42 pounds, 11 euros, and 3000 yen. If there are 2 pounds per euro and 100 yen per pound, how much does Jack have in yen?
A: First convert the euros to pounds: 11 euros * 2 pounds / euro = 22 pounds. Then add that amount to the amount Jack has in pounds: 22 pounds + 42 pounds = 64 pounds. Then convert the pounds to yen: 64 pounds * 100 yen / pound = 6400 yen. Then add that amount to the amount Jack has in yen: 6400 yen + 3000 yen = 9400 yen. The answer is 9400.
Question: Jason worked for 9 years as a bartender and 3 years and six months as a manager. How many months of work experience does he have total?
Answer: First find how many months Jason worked as a bartender: 9 years * 12 months / year = 108 months. Then find how many months Jason worked as a manager: 3 years * 12 months / year + 6 months = 42 months. Then add those two amounts to find his total amount of work experience: 108 months + 42 months = 150 months. The answer is 150.
[Question]Megan is making food for a party. She has to spend 20 minutes preparing one dish in the oven. Each dish can feed 5 people. She spends 2 hours preparing as many of these dishes as she can for the party. How many people can she feed with these dishes?
[Answer]First, we need to determine the total amount of minutes available for cooking. We do this by performing 2 * 60 = 120, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. Now that we know we have 120 minutes, we then divide the preparation time into the total amount of time by performing 120 / 20 = 6 dishes capable of being made. Since each dish can feed 5 people, we find the total number of people fed by performing 5 * 6 = 30 people. The answer is 30.
Q: Gentry assembled a new 24 foot round pool in her backyard. To fill the pool with water, she used four hoses. Two of the hoses each deliver water at a rate of 2 gallons per minute. The other two hoses each deliver water at a rate of 3 gallons per minute. With a volume of 15,000 gallons, how many hours will it take to fill the pool?
A: Each of the two hoses delivers water at a rate of 2 gallons per minute, for a combined total of 2 * 2 = 4 gallons of water per minute. The other two hoses each deliver water at a rate of 3 gallons per minute, for a combined total of 2 * 3 = 6 gallons of water per minute. Thus, all four hoses deliver a combined total of 4 + 6 = 10 gallons of water per minute. With a volume of 15,000 gallons, it would take 15,000 / 10 = 1500 minutes to fill the pool. Converting to hours, it will take 1500 / 60 = 25 hours to fill the pool. The answer is 25.
Question: For the family reunion, Peter is buying 16 pounds of bone-in chicken and half that amount in hamburgers. He's going to buy 2 more pounds of hot dogs than hamburgers. He's also going to buy several sides that will weigh half the amount of hot dogs. How many pounds of food will he buy?
Answer: He is buying 16 pounds of chicken and half that amount in hamburgers so he's buying 16 / 2 = 8 pounds of hamburgers. He's going to buy 2 more pounds of hotdogs than hamburgers, which are 8 pounds so he'll have 2 + 8 = 10 pounds of hot dogs. He's going to buy sides that weigh half the amount of the hot dogs so that's 10 / 2 = 5 pounds of sides. He's buying 16 pounds of chicken, 8 pounds of hamburgers, 10 pounds of hot dogs and 5 pounds of sides for a total of 16 + 8 + 10 + 5 = 39 pounds of food. The answer is 39.
