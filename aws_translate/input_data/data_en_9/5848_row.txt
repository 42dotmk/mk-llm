Q: Martha is making centerpieces for her Thanksgiving dinner. There are six centerpieces, and each centerpiece uses 8 roses, twice as many orchids as roses, and a certain number of lilies. If Martha wants to spend $2700 total, and each flower costs $15, how many lilies will she put in each centerpiece?
A: First figure out how many total flowers Martha is going to buy by dividing her total spending by the price per flower: $2700 / $15 / flower = 180 flowers. Now figure out how many flowers are in each centerpiece by dividing the total number of flowers by the number of centerpieces: 180 flowers / 6 centerpieces = 30 flowers / centerpiece. Now figure out how many orchids are in each centerpiece by multiplying the number of roses per centerpiece by 2: 8 roses / centerpiece * 2 = 16 orchids / centerpiece. Now subtract the number of roses and orchids per centerpiece from the total number of flowers per centerpiece to find the number of lilies per centerpiece: 30 flowers - 16 orchids - 8 roses = 6 lilies. The answer is 6.

[Question]An entrepreneur is crowdfunding a new business effort. He has three different dollar amount levels of financial backing options and each level is ten times as high as the previous one. He needs to raise $12000 to get his business off the ground. He succeeded after getting two backers at the highest level of financial backing, three at the second level, and ten at the lowest level. How many dollars was the highest level of financial backing?
[Answer]Let L represent the lowest level of financial backing. Thus, the second level is 10L and the highest level is 10 * 10L = 100L. The entrepreneur got 2 highest level backers, 3 second level backers, and 10 lowest level backers, so 2 * 100L + 3 * 10L + 10L = 200L + 30L + 10L = 240L = $12000. Therefore, the lowest level of financial backing was L = 12000 / 240 = $50. Thus, the highest level of financial backing was 10 * 10 * 50 = $5000. The answer is 5000.
Q: The zoo has 50 new visitors entering the zoo every hour. The zoo is open for 8 hours in one day. If 80% of the total visitors go to the gorilla exhibit, how many visitors go to the gorilla exhibit in one day?

Question: Elizabeth uses $3.00 worth of ingredients to make a bag of granola. She makes 20 bags and sells them for $6.00 a bag at the farmer's market. An hour before closing, she has sold 15 bags and marks the remaining 5 bags down to $4.00 and sells them soon after. What is her net profit?
Answer: She uses $3.00 of ingredients per 1 bag of granola and she makes 20 bags so she spends 3 * 20 = $60.00 on ingredients. She sells 15 bags for $6.00 so she makes 15 * 6 = $90.00. She sells her last 5 bags for $4.00 so she makes 5 * 4 = $20.00. She made $90.00 and $20.00 for a total of 90 + 20 = $110.00. She made $110.00 but spent $60.00 on ingredients so her net profit is 110 - 60 = $50.00. The answer is 50.
