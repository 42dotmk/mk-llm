 Colorado Springs police say a 14-year-old girl has died after she was shot by her stepfather. 
  
 It happened at a home in the 4000 block of Ascendant Drive, near North Carefree Circle and Peterson Road. 
  
 Police were originally called to the home to investigate a burglary just before 6 a.m. on Monday, Dec. 23, 2013. The caller told dispatchers the burglar was shot. A little over a minute later, dispatch reports the sad news it wasn't a burglar. When police arrived, they found the 14-year-old suffering from life-threatening injuries. She died at a hospital. 
  
 Police and the District Attorney's Office are investigating. 
  
 Jani Harvey lives across the street from the family. She heard the gunshots early Monday morning. 
  
 "I heard three bangs," said Harvey. "I assumed it was someone hitting on a car or a garage door or something like that." 
  
 She said the noise was startling. 
  
 "I thought it was strange, and I thought it was an odd hour for it to be going on. It's kind of a quiet neighborhood," said Harvey. 
  
 Directly next door, Mary Zesiewicz was awakened by police knocking on her door. 
  
 "They were making sure everyone was o.k." Zesiewicz said. 
  
 After she went to work, Zesiewicz learned why police were so concerned after a phone call from her son. 
  
 "He goes Mom, they removed bullets from our wall...it's a very, very scary feeling," Zesiewicz said.
