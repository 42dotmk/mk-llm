Q: Mary bought six apples from the store. From the apples she bought, for each that Mary ate, she planted two trees from the remaining ones. How many apples did Mary eat?
A: She planted eight trees. This means she used half of that amount of apples, which is 8 trees / 2 trees / apple = 4 apples. That means that she planted four of the six apples she bought, leaving only 6 apples - 4 apples = 2 apples to be eaten. The answer is 2.
Question: As a freelancer, Katherine takes 20 hours to develop a website for her clients. Her junior, Naomi, takes 1/4 times more time to complete creating a similar website. If many clients required her to build their websites in a particular year, and she gave her junior 30 websites to develop, calculate the total number of hours Katherine's junior took to create the 30 websites.
Answer: Katherine's junior takes 1 / 4 * 20 = 5 more hours to build a similar website as Katherine. The total number of hours Katherine's junior takes to build a website is 20 + 5 = 25 hours. If Katherine gave her junior 30 websites to build, her junior spent 30 * 25 = 750 hours on building the 30 websites. The answer is 750.

Q: Mark and his sister Chris both leave their house for school at the same time. Mark travels at the same speed as Chris, who walks 3 miles per hour. After walking 3 miles Mark has to turn around and go home because he forgot his lunch. If the distance from their house to the school is 9 miles, how much longer does Mark spend walking than Chris?
A: First find the total number of miles Mark walks to get his lunch by multiplying the distance he walks back to the house by 2: 3 miles * 2 = 6 miles. Then find the total distance Mark walks by adding that distance to the distance between the house and the school: 6 miles + 9 miles = 15 miles. Now divide the total distance Mark walks by his speed to find how many hours he spends walking: 15 miles / 3 miles / hour = 5 hours. Now divide the total distance Chris walks by her speed to find the total time she spends walking: 9 miles / 3 miles / hour = 3 hours. Now subtract the time Chris spends walking from the time Mark spends walking to find the difference: 5 hours - 3 hours = 2. The answer is 2.
Question: Charles is jogging while listening to his favorite album. He runs at 6 MPH when he's got music on and 4 MPH when he doesn't. His album is 40 minutes long. How many minutes will it take him to jog 6 miles?
Answer: He runs at .1 miles per minute because 6 / 60 = .1. While the album is playing he can run 4 miles because 40 x .1 = 4. He has to run 2 miles without the album because 6 - 4 = 2. Without music he runs 1 / 15 miles per minute because 4 / 60 = 1 / 15. He will run the remaining 2 miles in 30 minutes because 2 / (1 / 15) = 30. It will take him 70 minutes in total because 40 + 30 = 70. The answer is 70.
