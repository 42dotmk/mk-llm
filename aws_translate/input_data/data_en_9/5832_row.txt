With the signing of the Treaty of Rome in March 1957, the European Economic Community (EEC) was founded: the common market comprises the 6 countries Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Germany, and Italy.

The Treaty of Rome, signed by representatives of Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Germany, and Italy, essentially marked the birth of the European Economic Community (EEC), which later evolved into the European Union (EU) that exists today. The treaty aimed to create a unified economic community that would promote the economic development of its member states, enhance trade relations, and eventually reduce barriers to the free movement of goods, services, capital and labor.

The six founding countries, often referred to as the "Inner Six," had already begun working together to develop a multilateral cooperation in the aftermath of World War II as a means to rebuild their economies and strengthen relations among them. The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), established in 1951, was an early example of this cooperation, laying the foundation for the creation of the EEC.

The EEC's main focus was to establish a single market that would promote economic growth and development by facilitating the free movement of goods and services, allowing the member countries to benefit from economies of scale, increased competition and improved innovation. To accomplish this, the treaty outlined a series of measures that would gradually eliminate customs duties, harmonize trade policies and regulations, and establish common institutions to address economic and social concerns.

One key aspect of the EEC was the establishment of common policies in areas such as agriculture, transport and trade. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), for example, aimed to ensure a steady supply of food at stable prices while also providing a decent standard of living for farmers. The transport policy was established to connect the member countries and ensure the free flow of goods, while the common trade policy facilitated access to external markets through uniform negotiation.

Moreover, the treaty also laid the groundwork for the freedom of movement of persons, services, and capital within the EEC. The aim was to encourage worker mobility and create a dynamic labor market where the member states' workforce could move easily to regions with better economic opportunities.

In addition to these core principles, the treaty also emphasized the importance of maintaining a high level of social and economic cohesion within the community. This included provisions for a Social Fund to support the development of economically disadvantaged regions and a European Investment Bank (EIB) to finance large-scale infrastructure projects that would bring long-term benefits to the community.

Over time, the EEC expanded its membership and evolved into the European Union, building on the foundations set by the Treaty of Rome. Today, the EU has 27 member countries (following the United Kingdom's exit in 2020) and continues to promote economic cooperation, peaceful relations, and the harmonization of laws and standards among its members.

In summary, the signing of the Treaty of Rome in March 1957 marked the establishment of the European Economic Community, initially composed of Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Germany, and Italy. The EEC was created as a vehicle to promote economic growth, enhance trade relations, reduce barriers, and strengthen the foundations for the future European Union.
