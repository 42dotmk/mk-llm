Question: Donna made a cake to take to a party where the guests ate half the cake. The day after the party, she shared half the leftovers with her brothers. The following day, she ate one piece as a midnight snack. Twice as many pieces as her snack were left. How many pieces was the cake to begin with?
Answer: Donna had 2 * 1 = 2 pieces of cake left. Before her snack, there were 2 + 1 = 3 pieces left. Those 3 pieces were half the leftovers, so she had 3 * 2 = 6 pieces before sharing with her brothers. Those 6 pieces were half the party leftovers, so the cake was 2 * 6 = 12 pieces before the party. The answer is 12.
[Question]Michael ran a bakeshop and had to fill an order for 5 peach pies, 4 apple pies and 3 blueberry pies. Each pie recipe called for 3 pounds of fruit each. At the market, produce was on sale for $1.00 per pound for both blueberries and apples. The peaches each cost $2.00 per pound. How much will Michael spend at the market buying the fruit for his pie order?
[Answer]Each pie needs 3 pounds of fruit so for 5 Peach pies, 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of fruit. 3 pounds of fruit for 4 apple pies is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds. 3 pounds of fruit for 3 blueberry pies is 3 * 3 = 9 pounds. He needs 12 pounds of apples and 9 pounds of blueberries so 12 + 9 = 21. 21 pounds of fruit at $1.00 per pound is 21 * 1 = $21.00. 15 pounds of peaches will cost $2.00 per pound so 15 * 2 = $30. The apple and blueberries will cost $21.00 and the peaches will cost $30 so 21 + 30 = $51. The answer is 51.
Q: Michael is baking a cake and needs 6 cups of flour. The only measuring cup he has is the 1/4 cup. He has an 8 cup bag of flour and realizes it would be faster to measure the flour he doesn't need, take it out of the bag, and then dump the rest of the bag into the bowl. How many scoops should he remove?
A: He needs to remove 2 cups of flour because 8 minus 6 equals 2. He needs to use 8 scoops because 2 divided by .25 equals 8. The answer is 8.
Question: Jude is trading his bottle cap collection to Arthur for some of Arthur's matchbox vehicles. Arthur charges Jude 5 bottle caps for a car and 6 bottle caps for a truck. Jude has 100 bottle caps. If he buys 10 trucks and spends 75% of his remaining bottle caps on cars, how many total matchbox vehicles does he buy?
Answer: The trucks cost 60 bottle caps because 10 x 6 = 60. He has 40 bottle caps left because 100 - 60 = 40. He spends 30 bottle caps on cars because 40 x .75 = 30. He gets 6 cars with this because 30 / 5 = 6. He gets 16 vehicles in total because 10 + 6 = 16. The answer is 16.
[Question]Clara is selling boxes of cookies to raise money for a school trip. There are 3 different types for sale. The first type has 12 cookies per box. The second type has 20 cookies per box, and the third type has 16 cookies per box. If Clara sells 50 boxes of the first type, 80 boxes of the second type, and 70 boxes of the third type, how many cookies does she sell?
[Answer]Clara sells 600 cookies of the first type because 12 * 50 = 600. She sells 1600 cookies of the second type because 20 * 80 = 1600. She sells 1120 cookies of the third type because 16 * 70 = 1120. Thus, Clara sells 3300 cookies total because 600 + 1600 + 1120 = 3320 cookies. The answer is 3320.
