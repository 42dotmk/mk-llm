Q: Julian has 80 Facebook friends. 60% are boys and 40% are girls. Boyd has twice as many friends who are girls and has 100 friends total. What percentage of Boydâ€™s friends are boys?
A: Julian's number of friends who are girls is .40 * 80 = 32. Boyd has twice as many friends as Julian who are girls, a total of 2 * 32 = 64. If Boyd has 100 friends, he has 100 - 64 = 36 boys. The percentage of boys in Boyd's Facebook friends is 36 / 100 * 100 = 36. The answer is 36.
Question: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?
Answer: If Mary collected twice the number of red marbles collected by Jenny, she got 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary, which is 60 + 20 = 80 red marbles. The total number of red marbles is 60 + 80 + 30 = 170 red marbles. If Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles collected by Jenny, then she got 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. Mary collected half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, thus 1 / 2 * 50 = 25 marbles. The total number of blue marbles collected is 50 + 25 + 25 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.
[Question]The school decided to have a fundraiser to collect $750 for new basketball equipment. Families could donate $25, $50, or $100. Families who donated $25 got Bronze Status. Families who donated $50 got Silver Status. Families who donated $100 got Gold Status. With one day left in the fundraiser, the school has 10 Bronze Status families, 7 Silver Status Families and 1 Gold Status family. How much do they need to raise on the final day to reach their goal?
[Answer]They collected $250 from Bronze Status families because 10 times 25 equals 250. They collected $350 from Silver Status families because 7 times 50 equals 350. They collected $100 from Gold Status families because 1 times 100 equals 100. Therefore, they collected $700 thus far because 250 plus 350 plus 100 equals 700. They need to collect $50 more because 750 minus 700 equals 50. The answer is 50.

Question: At a roller derby, 4 teams are competing. Each team is made up of 10 members, and each member needs a pair of roller skates to compete in and another pair of skates as a backup. None of the skates have laces yet, so each member is offered 3 sets of laces per pair of skates. How many sets of laces have been handed out?
Answer: There are a total of 4 teams * 10 members per team = 40 team members. Each person receives 1 pair of competing roller skates + 1 pair of backup roller skates = 2 pairs of roller skates. So there are a total of 40 team members * 2 pairs of roller skates per team member = 80 roller skates. There were therefore 80 roller skates * 3 sets of laces per pair of roller skates = 240 sets of laces handed out. The answer is 240.
