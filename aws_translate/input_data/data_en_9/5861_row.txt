Lee Rigby no doubt thought that he might die in the service of his country, but he would not have imagined that he would be brutally murdered by his fellow citizens right in the heart of London," the judge remarked during the sentencing.

Michael Adebolajo, 29 at the time of the attack, was given a whole life term, meaning he will not be eligible for parole. Michael Adebowale, who was 22 at the time, was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 45 years before being eligible for parole. The distinction in the terms given to the two men was partly due to the fact that Adebolajo was considered the ringleader and had a history of extremist behavior, whereas Adebowale was seen as a more impressionable individual who followed Adebolajo's lead.

The barbaric killing of Lee Rigby shocked not only the UK but the world over. The fact that two radicalized men carried out such a horrific act in broad daylight, with such blatant disregard for the sanctity of human life, exposed the dark underbelly of homegrown terrorism and the radicalization of young men within the country's borders.

The trial, which lasted for about six weeks, saw the jury of eight women and four men listen to the harrowing details of the murder. They were shown shocking surveillance footage and images of the two men dragging Rigby's lifeless body onto the road, as if to make a macabre exhibition of it. Eyewitnesses recounted the events of that day, with one describing the scene as resembling "a butcher's shop window."

Adebolajo's defense lawyer claimed his client was "a soldier of Allah" and argued that he was motivated by religious beliefs, which justified the murder as an act of war against a British soldier. Adebowale did not take the stand during the trial, and his lawyers did not attempt to justify his actions, but rather, they sought to downplay the religious motivations behind the attack.

In the aftermath of the killing, a significant debate arose regarding the role of the UKâ€™s security agencies in preventing radicalization and monitoring the activities of known extremists. Prior to the attack, both Adebolajo and Adebowale were known to the security services and had been linked to extremist organizations. This raised questions about whether the authorities could have done more to prevent the attack.

The convoluted and complex issue of radicalization in the UK has been a subject of intense scrutiny since the murder of Lee Rigby. The government initiated various programs to counteract radicalization and homegrown terrorism, such the implementation of the Prevent strategy. This involves identifying individuals at risk of being drawn into terrorism and offering support to prevent the progression towards violent extremism. 

Efforts to tackle this issue also extend to online platforms, as a large part of modern radicalization occurs through the internet. Online radicalization is part of the dark side of the digital age, and tackling it presents a unique set of challenges for governments and security services around the world.

The sentencing of Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale allowed some measure of justice for Lee Rigby and his family, but the case also served as a stark reminder of the potential danger posed by radicalized individuals within society. The battle against terrorism and radicalization is an ongoing one that requires the collaboration of law enforcement, communities, and individuals alike, in order to protect the values of freedom and democracy that form the very fabric of our society.
