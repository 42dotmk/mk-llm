Roque takes 2 * 3 = 6 hours a week to walk to work. Roque takes 6 * 2 = 12 hours a week to walk to and from work. Roque takes 1 * 2 = 2 hours a week to bike to work. Roque takes 2 * 2 = 4 hours a week to bike to and from work. In total, Roque takes 12 + 4 = 16 hour a week to go to and from work.
The answer: 16
Reverse engineering the question: It takes Roque two hours to walk to work and one hour to ride his bike to work. Roque walks to and from work three times a week and rides his bike to and from work twice a week. How many hours in total does he take to get to and from work a week with walking and biking?

Reasoning and answer: He is washing 10 ounces of shirts because 2 x 5 = 10. He is washing 6 ounces of socks because 3 x 2 = 6. He is already washing 34 ounces of clothes because 10 + 10 + 8 + 6 = 34. He can wash 16 more ounces because 50 - 34 = 16. He can wash 4 pairs of underwear because 16 / 4 = 4.
The answer: 4

Question: Tony's dad is very strict about the washing machine and family members are only allowed to wash 50 total ounces of clothing at a time. Tony doesn't want to break the rules, so he weighs his clothes and finds that a pair of socks weighs 2 ounces, underwear weighs 4 ounces, a shirt weighs 5 ounces, shorts weigh 8 ounces, and pants weigh 10 ounces. Tony is washing a pair of pants, 2 shirts, a pair of shorts, and 3 pairs of socks. How many more pairs of underwear can he add to the wash and not break the rule?

Let H = Hezekiah's age. Ryanne = H + 7. 2H + 7 = 15. 2H = 8. H = 4. Hezekiah is 4 years old.
The answer: 4
Reverse engineering the question: Ryanne is 7 years older than Hezekiah. Together Ryanne's and Hezekiah's ages equal 15 years. How many years old is Hezekiah?

Reasoning and answer: First find how many kids from Riverside High are rejected: 20% * 120 kids = 24 kids. Then find how many kids from West Side High are rejected: 70% * 90 kids = 63 kids. Then find how many kids from Mountaintop High are rejected: 50 kids / 2 = 25 kids. Then add the number of kids from each school to find the total number of kids: 120 kids + 90 kids + 50 kids = 260 kids. Then subtract all the kids who were rejected from the total number of kids to find the number who got in: 260 kids - 24 kids - 63 kids - 25 kids = 148 kids.
The answer: 148

Question: Fern is checking IDs to get into an R-rated movie. She denied 20% of the 120 kids from Riverside High, 70% of the 90 kids from West Side High, and half the 50 kids from Mountaintop High. How many kids got into the movie?

Catherine gave eight pens to each of her seven friends, a total of 8 * 7 = 56 pens. She remained with 60 - 56 = 4 pens. When she also gave 6 pencils to each of her seven friends, she gave away 6 * 7 = 42 pencils. Since she had the same number of pencils as pens, she remained with 60 - 42 = 18 pencils. The total number of pens and pencils that Catherine remained with is 4 + 18 = 22.
The answer: 22
Reverse engineering the question: Catherine had an equal number of pencils and pens. If she had 60 pens and gave eight pens and 6 pencils to each of her seven friends and kept the rest for herself, how many pens and pencils did she have left?

Sebastian in the percussion section makes 1 person. The brass section has 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 people. The strings section has 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 people. The woodwinds section has 3 + 4 = 7 people. The maestro is 1 person. Thus, the orchestra has 1 + 7 + 5 + 7 + 1 = 21 people in it.
The answer: 21
