Writing an article commenting on the percentage of non-English individuals as per a census requires archaeological data from a specific census as a basis. Without such data, creating an accurate and informative response is difficult. Let's assume we're exploring the US census data as an example for this article. Due to the lack of targeted census data, the results might differ. 

Title: Linguistic Diversity in the United States: A Closer Look at the Census

The United States of America (USA), known as a melting pot of cultural and linguistic diversity, attracts immigrants from different corners of the globe in search of better opportunities and quality of life. According to recent U.S. Census Bureau data, the percentage of people who do not speak English at home is comparatively substantial, presenting a succinct snapshot of the USA's increasingly multilingual population.

Before delving into the numbers, it's essential to acknowledge that the Census Bureau asks respondents their proficiency in English as well, which helps differentiate between those who do not primarily speak English at home but are still fluent in the language, and those who lack English proficiency altogether. 

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2018, it was reported that 21.6% of the American resident population (over 5 years of age) didn't use English as their primary language at home. This amounted to approximately 67.3 million people, a significant increase from a decade earlier. This same data set reported that 8.5% of the population claimed they spoke English less than "very well," implying a substantial group of residents may struggle with English, even if it isn't their primary language at home.

These figures represent several multilingual communities in the USA, including Spanish, Chinese (including Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, Arabic, French, and Korean. First on this list is the Spanish-speaking community, which represents about 62% of the non-English speaking population.

Chinese is the second most spoken non-English language, with approximately 2.9 million speakers in the US. The Tagalog-speaking population is nearly 1.7 million, and the Vietnamese community is about 1.5 million. These communities are followed by around 1.2 million French speakers and 1.1 million Korean language speakers in the United States. 

Comparatively, the percentage of non-English speakers may seem small but itâ€™s an undeniable and growing part of US society. Without adequate language resources and integration efforts, these communities may find it challenging to connect with mainstream services, and the broader community as a whole. 

In conclusion, while English remains the dominant language in the United States, a considerable percentage of the population speaks a different language at home. The census data paints a picture of a country that is linguistically diverse. With the increasing globalization, the number and proportion of non-English speakers are likely to continue growing, hence making it essential for public services to encompass such diversity in their services and programs.

Keep in mind that the data will vary depending on the country and the particular census year. For example, the linguistic make-up of Canada or the United Kingdom would be significantly different, as would the data on today's United States compared with 50 years ago. Therefore, it's vital to specify a particular census and country when discussing the linguistic data pulled from it to produce accurate conclusions.
