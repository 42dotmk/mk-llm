Question: Tommy's mother lets him ride his bike 2 blocks north of his block, 3 blocks east, 2 blocks west, and 2 blocks south. His friend's father lets his friend ride his bike 80 square blocks. How many times greater is the area his friend can ride in compared to Tommy?
Answer: Tommy's area is 5 blocks wide because 3 + 2 = 5. His area is 4 blocks tall because 2 + 2 = 4. The total area is 20 square blocks because 5 x 4 = 20. His friend's area is 4 times bigger because 80 / 20 = 4. The answer is 4.
[Question]Kantana loves chocolate. Every Saturday she goes to the candy store and buys 2 chocolates for herself and 1 for her sister. This last Saturday she picked up an additional 10 chocolates as a birthday gift for her friend Charlie. How many chocolates did Kantana end up buying for the month?
[Answer]There is 1 Saturday in a week and there are 4 weeks in a month so there are 1 * 4 = 4 Saturdays in a month (on average). If Kantana buys herself 2 chocolates every Saturday then this means she buys 2 * 4 = 8 chocolates for herself for the month. Kantana also buys her sister 1 chocolate on these trips so she is picking up an additional 1 * 4 = 4 additional chocolates for her sister for the month. Kantana decided to also purchase some chocolates for her friend Charlie for his birthday. She bought Charlie 10 chocolates. This means that for the month she bought 10 chocolates for Charlie, 4 chocolates for her sister, and 8 chocolates for herself, 10 + 4 + 8 = 22 chocolates bought in total for the month. The answer is 22.
Q: In a 50-question test with two marks for each question, Meghan learned that she scored 20 marks less than her friend Jose, who scored 40 more marks than their friend Alisson. Calculate the total score for the three in the test combined if Jose got 5 questions wrong?
A: If you answer every question correctly in the test, the total possible marks are 50 * 2 = 100 marks. If Jose got five questions wrong, he lost 5 * 2 = 10 marks because each question has two marks. Therefore, Jose scored 100 - 10 = 90 marks on the test. Meghan scored 20 marks less than that which Jose got, a total of 90 - 20 = 70 marks. The total marks that Jose and Meghan scored in the test are 70 + 90 = 160. Alisson scored 90 - 40 = 50 marks in the examination, 40 marks less than that which Jose scored on the test. The total number of marks that the three scored in the test is 160 + 50 = 210. The answer is 210.

[Question]Jenny wants to read 3 books in the next 10 days. She can read 100 words per hour. If the first book has 200 words, the second book has 400 words, and the third book has 300 words, how many minutes per day, on average, should she spend reading?
[Answer]She wants to read 200 + 400 + 300 = 900 pages total. She needs to spend 900 / 100 = 9 hours reading in the next three weeks. In minutes, she will need to spend 9 * 60 = 540 minutes. Thus, she should spend 540 minutes / 10 days = 54 minutes per day reading. The answer is 54.
