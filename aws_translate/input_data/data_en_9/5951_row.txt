Question: Tree Elementary School is raising money for a new playground. Mrs. Johnson’s class raised $2300, which is twice the amount that Mrs. Sutton’s class raised. Mrs. Sutton’s class raised 8 times less than Miss Rollin’s class. Miss Rollin’s class raised a third of the total amount raised by the school. How much money did the school raise for the playground if 2% will be deducted for administration fees?
Answer: Find the amount Mrs. Sutton’s class raised by dividing $2300 by 2. $2300 / 2 = $1150. Find the amount Miss Rollin’s class raised by multiplying $1150 by 8. $1150 x 8 = $9200. Multiply $9200 by 3 to find the total amount raised. $9200 x 3 = $27600. Convert 2% to decimal. 2 / 100 = 0.02. Multiply $27600 by 0.02 to find the administration fees. $27600 x 0.02 = $552. Subtract the administration fee from the total amount raised. $27600 - $552 = $27048. The answer is 27048.
[Question]Central Park had 8 more than half of the number of trash cans as in Veteran's Park. Then one night, someone took half of the trash cans from Central Park and put them in Veteran's Park. If originally there were 24 trash cans in Veteran's Park, how many trash cans are now in Veteran's Park?
[Answer]Half the original number of trash cans in Veteran's Park is 24 / 2 = 12 trash cans. Thus Central Park originally had 8 more than half the number of trash cans as what was originally in Veteran's Park, or 12 + 8 = 20 trash cans. Half of the trash cans from Central Park is 20 / 2 = 10 trash cans. After the addition of the 10 new cans, there are now 24 + 10 = 34 trash cans in Veteran's Park. The answer is 34.
Q: Andy walks 50 meters from his house to school. After school, he comes back to the house and goes to the market. If he walks 140 meters in total, how many meters is the distance between the house and the market?
A: He walks 50m from home to school and walks 50m again from school to house, so he walks 50m + 50m = 100 meters. If the total distance is 140m, the distance between the house and the market is 140m - 100m = 40 meters. The answer is 40.
Question: A bottle of wine costs $20.00 today. When new tariffs are imposed in 2 months, the price of wine will increase by 25%. How much more expensive will 5 bottles of wine be in 2 months?
Answer: Today, 5 bottles of $20.00 wine will cost 5 * 20 = $100.00. In 2 months there will be a 25% tariff on the 5 bottles of wine that cost $100.00 so that makes the 5 bottles .25 * 100 = $25.00 more expensive. The answer is 25.
[Question]Carlo has a music recital next week. He practiced twice as long on Monday as on Tuesday. On Tuesday, he practiced 10 minutes less than on Wednesday. On Wednesday, he practiced 5 minutes more than on Thursday. On Thursday, he practiced for 50 minutes. If he needs to practice for a total of 5 hours that week, how long should Carlo practice on Friday?
[Answer]On Wednesday, Carlo practiced for 50 + 5 = 55 minutes. On Tuesday, he practiced for 55 - 10 = 45 minutes. On Monday, he practiced for 45 x 2 = 90 minutes. So, Carlo practiced for a total of 90 + 45 + 55 + 50 = 240 minutes from Monday to Thursday. He needs to practice for a total of 60 x 5 = 300 minutes. Therefore, he should practice for 300 - 240 = 60 minutes on Friday. The answer is 60.
