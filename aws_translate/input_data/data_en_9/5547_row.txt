Question 1: Does anyone have an idea about the time line of Visa Sub Class 189 for Australia? After submitting Medical and PCC, how much maximum time will it require?

Answer 1: The Skilled Independent visa (subclass 189) is an Australian permanent residency visa for skilled workers who meet the required criteria and pass the point test. The processing time for the subclass 189 visa can vary depending on various factors such as application volumes, seasonal fluctuations, and the complexity of individual applications. However, the approximate processing time for the visa subclass 189 can be broken down as follows:

1. Invitations to apply: Once you have submitted your Expression of Interest (EOI) to apply for the visa, you may receive an invitation to apply. The invitation rounds are generally conducted by the Department of Home Affairs twice a month, although the dates can vary. Only the highest-ranking EOIs receive invitations, and the cut-off scores vary each round.

2. Visa application preparation and submission: Once you receive an invitation to apply, you have 60 days to submit your visa application, gather all the required documents, and pay the application fees. This timeframe may vary depending on how quickly you gather and submit all of the required information.

3. Medical and character assessments: The time it takes to complete Medical examinations and the submission of the Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) can vary depending on the individual's circumstances, local infrastructures, and processing times of the concerned authorities. The medical examination results are typically valid for 12 months, and the PCC is generally valid for a year.

4. Visa processing time: According to the Department of Home Affairs, the current processing time for 75% of the subclass 189 applications is around 6 months, while 90% of applications are processed within 8 months. This can vary based on the workload of the immigration authorities and the specific details of your application.

In summary, after submitting your Medical and PCC, the processing time can range from a few weeks to a few months depending on various factors. It's essential to monitor the status of your application regularly and provide any additional information requested by the authorities promptly.

Question 2: Can I apply for a 189 visa while I am on a 190 visa in Australia? 

Answer 2: Yes. If you are currently in Australia on a Skilled Nominated visa (subclass 190), you can still apply for the Skilled Independent visa (subclass 189) if you meet the eligibility requirements. You would need to submit an Expression of Interest (EOI) for the subclass 189 visa through the SkillSelect system and, if you receive an invitation to apply, submit a visa application alongside the required documents, fees, and medical and character assessments.

It is essential to note that you must continue to meet and fulfill the conditions of your subclass 190 visa while your subclass 189 application is being processed. Also, receiving an invitation to apply for a subclass 189 visa does not guarantee visa grant: your application will be subject to the standard eligibility requirements, assessment, and processing guidelines.

In conclusion, Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is related to the processing timeline of the Visa Subclass 189 for Australia. In contrast, Question 2 asks about the possibility of applying for a Subclass 189 visa while already in Australia on a Subclass 190 visa.
