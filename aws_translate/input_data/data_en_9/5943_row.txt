On January 7, 2015, terrorists stormed the Charlie Hebdo headquarters in Paris, gunning down twelve staff members, including cartoonists and editors. Many around the world were shaken, mourning the loss of these lives while simultaneously struggling to understand the motivations behind such a violent act. The tragedy, fueled by the magazine’s history of controversial caricatures and satirical content, sent ripples throughout the media landscape.
