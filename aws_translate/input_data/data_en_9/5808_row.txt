Title: A Detailed Guide to Split a Cell in Excel Using Text to Columns Option

One of the great features of Microsoft Excel is its ability to manipulate data and present it in a structured and easy-to-understand manner. Even more helpful is its flexibility, allowing users a multitude of ways that they can reorganize, slice, and dice their data. One of these functions is the ability to split the content of a cell into multiple cells. This is particularly useful when you have a lot of data in one cell that you need to split into different columns. For instance, you may have a cell with full names and you wish to separate them into first names and last names. This article will guide you through a step-by-step process on how to do this using Excel’s “Text to Columns” feature with the Fixed Width option. 

1. **Select the Cell You Wish To Split Up**: First things first, open your Excel sheet and navigate to the cell housing the data you wish to split up. For instance, this might be a cell containing both first and last name of a person. Click on the cell to select it, thereby making it active. 

2. **Click Data**: With your data cell selected, find and click on the 'Data' tab in the Excel toolbar at the top of your screen. This opens up a variety of data tools you can use to manage your spreadsheet. 

3. **Select Text to Columns**: Inside the Data menu, you'll find a vast array of options. Look for the 'Text to Columns' button, which will be situated in the 'Data Tools' group, and click on it. This function will enable you to split your selected cell’s content. 

4. **Select Fixed Width**: Upon clicking 'Text to Columns', a wizard will open, presenting two options: 'Delimited' and 'Fixed width'. Select 'Fixed Width' if you want to divide your data in the cell based on a certain number of characters. For example, if your cell is a full name and you want to split it into first and last name, fixed width would be the best option.

5. **Click Next**: In the next screen, you will have to decide where the division of the text will occur. You can adjust the width by clicking on the lines (break lines) and moving them left or right to indicate where you want the division to be. Once you have set your desired fixed width, click on 'Next' to proceed. 

6. **Click Next Again**: The next screen of the 'Text to Columns' wizard lets you set the data format for the new columns created when the text is split. You can choose from different formats such as General, Text, or Date. You can even skip certain columns you don't want in your final output. After putting in all the necessary parameters, click 'Next' once more.

7. **Click Finish**: On the final screen, Excel gives you the option to select where you want the new columns of data to be placed. It could be in the existing cell (which will replace the original data) or you could specify a new location. Once you've made your decision, click 'Finish' to complete the procedure.

Upon performing these steps, your selected cell's content is now divided among multiple cells as per your chosen parameters. 

This feature is incredibly useful for cleaning up and organizing data, whether for personal or professional use. However, remember that every dataset is unique. Always double-check your results to ensure accuracy and prevent loss of important information. The ‘Text to Columns’ feature gives Microsoft Excel users the opportunity to utilize their data in an entirely new way, adding flexibility and functionality to the already robust Excel platform.
