Best Quarterbacks For The Buck
Sometimes there’s just no substitute for experience.

Dallas Cowboys quarterback Jon Kitna began his pro football career in Europe after a college career at middling Central Washington University left him undrafted by the NFL in 1995. He caught on in the NFL two years later when the Seattle Seahawks signed him as a free agent, the onset of a long career that saw him hold starting jobs on and off in Seattle, Cincinnati and Detroit.

Last season, the Cowboys dealt for the 38-year-old Kitna to back up starter Tony Romo. He gave them a lot more than expected – when Romo went down with a broken collarbone, Kitna stepped in and started nine games. All he did was complete 66% of his passes for over 2,300 yards and 16 touchdowns, good enough for a passer rating of 88.9, slightly better than the NFL average. The disappointing Cowboys, 6-10 last year, were a more respectable 4-5 when Kitna started.

Given Kitna’s relatively paltry $2 million salary, part of a five-year, $12 contract he signed with Detroit in 2009, no QB in the league gave his club more or the money last year. Coming closest: Baltimore’s third-year man, Joe Flacco, who turned in a slightly better QB rating (93.6) for 35% more money ($2.7 million). Flacco, a mid-first round pick out of the University of Delaware in 2008, has steadily improved over his three seasons while leading the Ravens to a 32-16 record and three straight playoff berths. Flacco’s five-year deal was commensurate with his draft status – no top ten money here – but he’s clearly on a pace to strike it rich by 2013. For now, the Ravens are enjoying the bargain.

Quarterback rating, the yardstick by which the position is primarily measured, is figured by a statistical formula that works in completion percentage, touchdown passes and interceptions per attempt, along with yardage per attempt.

The top rated passer in the league last year, New England’s Tom Brady (111.0 rating), earned a relatively modest $6.5 million as he played out the final year of a long term contract. That’s good enough to make him the seventh best quarterback for the buck for 2010. Brady has since cashed in with a four-year, $72 million extension, a deal that briefly made him the league’s highest paid player until the Colts’ Peyton Manning topped it with an extension of his own a few months later (Manning’s $15 million salary and 91.9 passer rating left him off the 2010 best for the buck list).

Like Brady the Eagles’ Michael Vick took a turn on the Best of the Buck list before cashing in big time this season. After taking over the starting job early in early 2010, Vick turned in a 100.2 QB rating for just $5.5 million (and rushed for 676 yards to boot). He was rewarded – initially with a $15.7 million tender for this season, and then with an all-in $100 million extension.

Others delivering above their pay grade: Oakland’s Jason Campbell ($3.25 million; 84.5 rating) who led the Raiders to their best season in eight years after coming over from Washington, and Tampa Bay’s Josh Freeman ($5 million; 95.9) a second-year man who threw for 25 TDs last year as the Bucs improved to 10-6 from 3-13 in 2009. And finally – sometimes big trades do work out for both teams. In 2009, the Chicago Bears and Denver Broncos decided to swap quarterbacks, with Jay Cutler going to Chicago and Kyle Orton to Denver. By 2010, both of them, making relatively modest salaries, rated among the ten best QB’s for the buck.
