No, the two questions you have mentioned are not the same. They address different aspects related to Instagram usage and engagement. Let's discuss them separately to provide detailed answers to each one.

Question 1: Can you change an Instagram filter on a pic that has been posted already?

Unfortunately, you cannot change the filter of an Instagram post after it has been published. When you upload a picture and apply a filter, it becomes a part of the image itself, and once posted, you cannot adjust or modify the filter. 

However, you do have a few options to work around this limitation:

1. Delete and Repost: You can delete the existing post with the unwanted filter and upload the picture again with the desired filter. Keep in mind that you will lose any likes, comments, and the engagement generated on the original post.

2. Repost with a Correction: Instead of deleting the original post with the unwanted filter, you can upload a new version of the image with the desired filter and provide context in the caption or comments, explaining that it's an updated version or a corrected post.

3. Edit the Caption: Although you cannot change the filter itself, you can edit the caption and tags of a published post on Instagram. This allows you to add context or explanation, or update hashtags to improve reach and engagement.

Question 2: I have 10k followers on Instagram. How much can I charge per promotional posts? (I take the pics of products)

The amount you can charge for promotional posts on your Instagram account depends on several factors, including your engagement rate, the quality of your content, your niche, and the specifics of the collaboration or partnership. There isn't a fixed rate for sponsored posts as it can vary greatly between influencers. However, here are some guidelines that can help you determine an appropriate rate:

1. Engagement Rate: A higher engagement rate indicates that your audience is more connected and responsive to your content. This makes your account more valuable to potential collaborators. Calculate your engagement rate by dividing the average number of likes and comments per post by your total number of followers and multiplying the result by 100.

2. Content Quality and Niche: The quality of your content and the specific niche you cater to are also critical. High-quality content showcasing excellent photography, captivating captions, and unique perspectives can command a higher rate. A niche or targeted audience can be more valuable to brands looking for influencers within specific markets.

3. Experience and Reputation: As you perform more sponsored collaborations, you'll become more experienced and gain a reputation as a reliable and effective influencer. This can increase the rates you can charge.

4. Payment Models: You may opt for different payment models based on your preferences. Some possible payment models are:
    a. Pay-per-post: Charge a fixed fee for each sponsored post you create.
    b. Cost-per-engagement: Charge based on the number of engagements generated by the sponsored post.
    c. Product Gifting/Barter: Accept free products or services in exchange for your promotional efforts.

As a general benchmark, with a following of 10k, you can consider charging anywhere from $50 to $200 per post. However, it's essential to be flexible and negotiate with potential clients. Ultimately, finding a balance between generating income and maintaining a genuine connection with your audience is key to long-term success as an Instagram influencer.
