[Question]Musa is the class teacher of a class of 45 students. He wants to split them into three groups by age. If a third of the class is under 11 years, and two-fifths are above 11 but under 13, how many students will be in the third group (13 years and above)?
[Answer]The first group is a third of the class which is (1 / 3) * 45 = 15 students. There are 15 students in the first group, so there are 45 - 15 = 30 students. The second group is two - fifths of the class which is (2 / 5) * 45 = 18 students. There are 18 in the second group so there are 30 - 18 = 12 students left in the third group. The answer is 12.
Q: Baking in batches of 65 cupcakes, Carla made 45 batches of cupcakes for her daughter's birthday party. She then took 5 cupcakes from each batch, and fed them to her dogs. If Carla's daughter had 19 friends and they shared the remaining cupcakes equally among them, including the daughter, calculate the number of cupcakes that each of Carla's daughter's friends ate.
A: If Carla sampled 5 cupcakes from each batch and fed them to her dogs, each batch had 65 - 5 = 60 cupcakes afterwards. Since Carla made 45 batches of cupcakes for her daughter's birthday party, after removing the 5 cupcakes from each batch, Carla's daughter and her friends received 45 * 60 = 2700 cupcakes. The total number of people at the party is 19 friends + 1 daughter = 20. After sharing the cupcakes equally among them, Carla's daughter and her friends each received 2700 / 20 = 135 cupcakes. The answer is 135.
Question: The Early Bird Dinner offered dinner meals at half off the menu price if you eat between 2-4 pm. Curtis ordered the Salisbury Steak that costs $16.00 and Rob ordered the Chicken Fried Steak at $18.00. If they ate at 3 pm, what was the cost of their total bill?
Answer: Curtis had the Salisbury steak for $16.00 and Rob had the Chicken Fried Steak at $18.00 so their meal cost 16 + 18 = $34.00. They ate 3 pm so their meal is half off so their meal cost 34 / 2 = $17.00. The answer is 17.
[Question]A boy squirrel gathers 6 walnuts and carries them to his burrow in the tree, adding to the 12 already there, and dropping 1 on the way. The girl squirrel brings 5 more walnuts to their burrow and eats 2. How many walnuts are left?
[Answer]With the boy’s contribution, there are 12 + 6 = 18 walnuts. When he drops 1, now they have 18 - 1 = 17 walnuts. The girl adds to their stash, making the count 17 + 5 = 22 walnuts. When the girl eats 2, the final count is 22 - 2 = 20 walnuts. The answer is 20.
Q: Candace decides to enter a race. The race is run in 4 segments, with racers eliminated at the end of each segment. 10 racers are eliminated after the first segment. A third of the remaining racers are eliminated after the next section. Half of the remaining racers are eliminated before the last leg of the race. If 100 racers started the race, how many will run in the final section of the race?
A: After the first segment, there are 100 – 10 = 90 racers left in the race. After the second segment, 90 / 3 = 30 racers are eliminated. This leaves 90 – 30 = 60 racers to compete in the third segment. After the third segment, 60 / 2 = 30 more racers are eliminated. This leaves 60 – 30 = 30 racers to run in the final section of the race. The answer is 30.
