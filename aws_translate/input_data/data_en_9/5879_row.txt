To answer the elaborate question regarding the passing of two renowned composers, Richard Strauss and Béla Bartók, we must first delve into the respective life stories and backgrounds of these two extraordinary musicians in order to understand their historical context, contributions to the world of music, and the events leading up to their deaths.

Richard Strauss was a German composer, conductor, and pianist born on June 11, 1864, in Munich, Germany. He was an influential figure in the late Romantic and early Modern periods, known primarily for his remarkable skill in orchestration and his versatility in composing music across various genres, including opera, tone poems, chamber music, and lieder. Some of his most famous works include the operas "Salome" and "Der Rosenkavalier," and the tone poems "Don Juan" and "Also sprach Zarathustra," the latter of which was famously used in the opening scene of Stanley Kubrick's film, "2001: A Space Odyssey."

Béla Bartók, born on March 25, 1881, in Nagyszentmiklós, Hungary (now Sânnicolau Mare, Romania), was a Hungarian composer and pianist who was a prominent figure in the early 20th century, immersed in the realms of both musical composition and ethnomusicology. Known for his fusion of Eastern European folk music and traditional classical music, Bartók's contributions continue to be regarded as some of the most unique and influential in the contemporary classical repertoire. His work reflects a deep understanding of the innovations of that era, such as the twelve-tone technique and the rise of atonality. Some of Bartók's most celebrated compositions include the six string quartets, the piano concertos, and the orchestral suite "The Miraculous Mandarin."

Now, equipped with the relevant contextual information, we can explore the events leading up to the passing of these two prominent composers. Richard Strauss's later years were marked by a number of challenges, both personal and professional. World War II and the rise of the Nazi regime cast a shadow over Strauss' life. His granddaughter's Jewish heritage further complicated matters, causing him distress in his final years. Despite these difficulties, Strauss continued to compose until his final days. He passed away on September 8, 1949, in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, at the age of 85. His final works bore a more introspective quality, such as the "Four Last Songs," which poignantly reflect themes of death and transition.

Béla Bartók's later years were also fraught with hardship and struggle. His staunch opposition to the Nazi regime compelled him to emigrate to the United States in 1940. Once in America, however, he found it difficult to establish himself professionally and faced financial troubles. Additionally, his health began to deteriorate—a diagnosis of leukemia would eventually be revealed. Despite these complications, Bartók remained productive; the final years of his life saw the completion of several important works, such as the "Concerto for Orchestra" and the "Third Piano Concerto." His condition finally caught up with him, and Béla Bartók passed away on September 26, 1945, in New York City, at the age of 64.

In summary, it becomes clear that Béla Bartók passed away first, on September 26, 1945, followed by Richard Strauss about four years later, on September 8, 1949. While both composers experienced hardships in their twilight years, their legacies continue to influence the world of classical music and provide inspiration to generations of musicians and listeners alike.
