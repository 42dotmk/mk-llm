Q: Last night Kannon had 3 apples, a banana, and 4 oranges for dinner. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, and twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today. How many fruits would she have eaten so far in the two meals?
A: The total number of fruits that Kannon ate last is 3 apples + 1 banana + 4 oranges = 8. Since last night Kannon had 3 apples, today she'll eat 3 + 4 = 7 apples. She is also planning to eat 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, a total of 1 * 10 = 10 bananas. Kannon will also eat twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, which means she'll eat 7 * 2 = 14 oranges. Tonight Kannon will eat 14 oranges + 10 bananas + 7 apples = 31 fruits. In total, after tonight, Kannon would have eaten 31 + 8 = 39 fruits. The answer is 39.
Question: Van Helsing gets paid by the town to remove all the vampires and werewolves. He gets $5 per vampire and $10 per werewolf. He removes half the vampires and removes 8 werewolves, and earned $105. There were 4 times as many werewolves as vampires. What percentage of the werewolves did he remove?
Answer: He earns $80 from werewolf removal because 8 x 10 = 80. He earned $25 from vampire removal because 105 - 80 = 25. He removed 5 vampires from town because 25 / 5 = 5. There were 10 vampires because 5 / .5 = 10. There were 40 werewolves because 4 x 10 = 40. The proportion of werewolves that he removed was .2 because 8 / 40 = .2. The percentage of werewolves removed was 20% because 100 x .2 = 20. The answer is 20.

Q: Aaron and his brother Carson each saved up $40 to go to dinner. The bill is 3/4 of their total money. After, they go out for ice cream. Each scoop costs $1.5 and they get the same amount as each other. If they leave with $1 in change each, how many scoops did they each buy?
A: They had $80 saved up because 2 x 40 = 80. They spent $60 because 80 x (3 / 4) = 60. They had $20 left for ice cream because 80 - 60 = 20. They had $2 left after leaving the ice cream shop because 2 x 1 = 2. They spent $18 on ice cream because 20 - 2 = 18. The bought 12 scoops of ice cream because 18 / 1.5 = 12. The each bought 6 scoops because 12 / 2 = 6. The answer is 6.
Question: Dr. Banks had 330 toothbrushes to give away to his patients. He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January. He gave away 67 toothbrushes in February. In March he gave away 46 toothbrushes. In April and May, he gave away the remaining toothbrushes, half each month. How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?
Answer: Through March, Dr. Banks gave out 53 + 67 + 46 = 166 toothbrushes. Before giving away toothbrushes in April, he had 330 - 166 = 164 toothbrushes remaining. Between April and May, he gave out the remaining 164 / 2 = 82 toothbrushes each month. Dr. Banks gave 82 toothbrushes in his busiest month and 46 toothbrushes during the slowest month. The difference would be 82 - 46 = 36 more toothbrushes in the busiest month. The answer is 36.
