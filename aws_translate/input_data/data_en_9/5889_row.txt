B). Jessica was an awful friend to have.

It was a stark contrast that could be felt by anyone who knew the two friends, Erin and Jessica. On one hand, you had Erin who was blessed with an intuitive and compassionate nature, always highly in tune with the feelings of others and willing to lend a helping hand to a friend in need. On the other hand, there was Jessica, a character known for her egotistical and selfish ways, often preoccupied with herself and her needs above those of the people around her.

The friendship between Erin and Jessica was turbulent at best, marred by instances when Jessica would treat Erin and others with little or no regard. Jessica's selfish attitude caused strain in their bond, presenting constant challenges for Erin in maintaining her patient and understanding demeanor. As years went by, the consequences of Jessica's selfish behavior began to mount, leading to a negative impact on Erin's mental and emotional well-being.

On countless occasions, Erin went out of her way to help Jessica, whether it was providing emotional support or assisting her with various tasks. Erin's compassionate tendencies were fueled by a deep-rooted desire to help those in need, making her a valuable friend to others. Conversely, Jessica seldom reciprocated this kindness. She was the type who expected everything to revolve around her and frequently acted on her own self-interests. This made Jessica an awful friend to have, as she rarely placed any value on the feelings or needs of others.

Despite her unpleasant qualities, Jessica managed to maintain friendships by manipulating people and exploiting their vulnerability, and Erin was no exception. By preying on Erin's compassionate nature, Jessica managed to keep their friendship alive, albeit a rather one-sided one. However, as time wore on, the detrimental effects of Jessica's behavior became more and more evident to others within their social circle.

Being an awful friend was not only about what Jessica did, but also what she didn't do. A critical aspect of any healthy friendship is the ability to recognize the needs of others and respond appropriately. Unfortunately, Jessica lacked the empathy required to put someone else's feelings before her own. She would ignore Erin's pleas for support and repeatedly dismiss her concerns as unimportant, which only served to fuel the dysfunction within their friendship.

In contrast to Jessica, Erin's steadfast devotion to her friends positioned her as a person that others aspired to be around. She was the one who would gladly lend an ear and offer a shoulder to cry on, enacting the role of a true companion. Faced with challenges within her own life, Erin had the resilience and insight to recognize the inherent value of maintaining healthy relationships and understanding what it takes to be a good friend.

Ultimately, the stark comparison between Erin and Jessica – the former having an intuitive and compassionate demeanor, the latter being overly egotistical and selfish – undeniably demonstrated that Jessica was an awful friend to have. Erin's moral compass and unwavering commitment to her friends made her the superior choice as a friend for those who valued emotional support, understanding, and genuine human connection. In the end, it was Jessica's own character flaws that defined her as an undesirable friend, one who, at her core, thrived on exploitation and manipulation, severely lacking the empathy and selflessness that are essential ingredients of any lasting and meaningful friendship.
