Title: South East Asia's Familiarity with Trump-Like Leadership: A Closer Look

Introduction
In the aftermath of the 2016 US presidential elections, President-elect Donald Trump's victory was met with a range of reactions from around the world. While a significant number of Americans were left shocked and concerned about the future of their country, over 600 million people of South East Asia had a different outlook, feeling a sense of déjà vu with the seemingly novel rise of Trump to power. Indeed, South East Asia has seen political figures similar to Trump in both ideology and leadership style that make his election unsurprising for them. This article aims to explore these striking resemblances and analyze why Trump's presidency feels so familiar to the people of South East Asia.

Step 1: Identifying Trump-esque characteristics

To truly understand why South East Asians feel like they've seen it all before when discussing Trump, we must first break down the key characteristics that define the US president-elect. Among them are his controversial statements, hard-line policies, volatile temperament, and the overarching belief in nationalist ideals.

Step 2: Drawing parallels with South East Asian leaders

With these characteristics in mind, it is clear to see how Trump's rise in politics mirrors that of several South East Asian leaders. For instance, President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, known for his contentious policies and unpresidential demeanor, shares a similar set of qualities with Trump. Duterte made headlines for his brutal war on drugs, which has resulted in extrajudicial killings, as well as for his inflammatory remarks.

In Indonesia, the election of President Joko Widodo was seen as a populist triumph, much like Trump's election. Widodo, a businessman who challenged the political establishment, rose from humble beginnings to become the leader of the world's third largest democracy. His focus on improving infrastructure and standing up to foreign powers resonates with Trump's "America First" policy.

Another example can be seen in Malaysia, where former Prime Minister Najib Razak, was surrounded by corruption allegations, demonstrating the narrative of a businessman-like leader enmeshed in scandal - similar to Trump's own history of legal woes.

Step 3: Analyzing South East Asia's familiarity with populist sentiment

Throughout the years, South East Asia has faced multiple examples of populist sentiments taking root in the political sphere. The rise of authoritarian leaders in the region has historically been fueled by nationalist ideology and anti-establishment feelings, many of which are echoed in the United States through Trump's populist agenda. This familiarity with populist leaders and the disillusionment with traditional politics could explain why South East Asians are less shocked than others by Trump's election as president of the United States.

Conclusion

Ultimately, the key elements that define President-elect Trump's controversial character and political approach have been evident in various South East Asian leaders in recent years. From Duterte's strongman tactics to Widodo's populist appeal, South East Asian citizens have already seen and experienced a variety of leaders who mirror Trump's brash persona and nationalistic policies. As a result, the people of South East Asia may view Trump's presidency as less of a surprise and more of a continuation of a global political trend that they have already witnessed firsthand in their own region.
