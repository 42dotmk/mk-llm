To prevent unwanted pregnancies when having sex, follow these steps:

Step 1: Understand the importance of contraception
Before engaging in sexual activities, it's crucial to comprehend the significance of contraception and how it helps prevent unwanted pregnancies. Educate yourself about the various methods available, their effectiveness, and any potential side effects to make informed decisions.

Step 2: Have open communication with your partner
Discuss contraception options with your partner to determine the most suitable method for both of you. It's essential for both parties to be on the same page about preventing pregnancy and to respect each other's choice.

Step 3: Choose a suitable contraceptive method
Select a contraceptive method based on factors such as effectiveness, accessibility, affordability, and possible side effects. Here are a few commonly used options:

- Barrier methods: These include condoms (both male and female), diaphragms, and cervical caps. They work by physically blocking sperm from entering the uterus. Barrier methods are readily available and can also protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

- Hormonal methods: These include birth control pills, patches, injections, and vaginal rings. They work by releasing hormones to prevent ovulation or change the uterine environment making it harder for sperm to reach the egg. You'll need a prescription from a healthcare professional for hormonal contraceptives, but they're highly effective when used correctly.

- Intrauterine devices (IUDs): An IUD is a small, T-shaped device that is inserted into the uterus by a healthcare professional to prevent pregnancy. There are two types: hormonal and copper-based. Both types have high effectiveness rates and can be used as a long-term contraceptive method.

- Emergency contraception: Also known as the "morning-after pill," emergency contraception can be used within 72 hours (preferably sooner) after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure. Keep in mind that this should not be used as a regular contraceptive method but only in emergencies.

Step 4: Consistently and correctly use your chosen contraceptive method
Adhere to the necessary instructions when using contraceptives. For instance, if you're on birth control pills, take them every day at the same time without skipping doses. If using condoms, make sure they are used correctly, are not expired, and are stored in a suitable environment to prevent damage.

Step 5: Regularly visit a healthcare professional
Schedule appointments with doctors or healthcare professionals to discuss your contraceptive options, assess the chosen method's effectiveness, and address any side effects you might experience. Regular check-ups ensure that your contraceptive needs are continuously evaluated and adjusted as needed.

In summary, preventing unwanted pregnancies requires responsible decision-making, open communication with your partner, choosing the appropriate contraceptive method, and consistently using it correctly. Keeping up with healthcare appointments and staying informed about your options will further ensure that you are taking the necessary precautions to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
