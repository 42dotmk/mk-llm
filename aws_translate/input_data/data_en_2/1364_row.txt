Title: "Ember of Hope"

Plot Summary:
"Ember of Hope" is a coming-of-age drama about a young woman named Katarina "Kat" Adams who discovers her passion for spoken word poetry. Unbeknownst to her, this newfound obsession drives her to uncover dark family secrets and helps her learn the true meaning of self-expression, love, and forgiveness.

Plot:
Kat, a reserved and introverted English major at a prestigious university, struggles to find her place among her more outgoing peers. Her life changes when she is assigned a project to write and recite an original poem for her poetry class. Reluctantly, Kat throws herself into the world of spoken word poetry.

As Kat searches for inspiration, she comes across an old forgotten box of her late mother's journals in her family's attic. Her mother, an English professor, had passed away when Kat was just a child, leaving unanswered questions and a void in her heart. Kat becomes captivated by her mother's eloquent words and finds solace in reading her poetry.

Determined to present a powerful poem, Kat decides to use her mother's writings as inspiration, combining their words to create a heartfelt narrative. Kat is initially nervous to share her work with the class, but when she recites her poem, she surprises everyone, including herself, with her raw talent and undeniable presence.

Kat's poetry gains recognition and admiration from students and professors. Among her burgeoning admirers is a kind and charismatic slam poetry enthusiast named Alex, who shows genuine interest in Kat's work and encourages her to join a local spoken word group called "Ember of Hope."

As Kat's confidence grows, she starts to unveil long-hidden family secrets in her mother's poetry. These secrets involve a troubled past, a strained marriage, and the subsequent affairs her mother divulged in her writings. Kat's father, an austere and reticent man, tries to prevent her from unearthing these truths and pleads with her to abandon her pursuit of poetry. 

Torn between resentment, anger, and the need for understanding, Kat struggles with the gravity of her mother's past and her newfound love for the art of poetry. As she continues to immerse herself in poetry, she becomes closer to Alex and starts developing romantic feelings for him. This newfound love affair motivates Kat to confront her family's troubled past and find a way to heal their damaged relationships.

In the climax, Kat takes the stage at a major spoken word competition and delivers a powerful and personal poem that reflects her journey of self-discovery, forgiveness, and love. This performance touches the heart of everyone in the audience, including her father, who later apologizes to Kat for not being as supportive as he should have been.

The film concludes with a heartwarming scene of Kat and her father reading her mother's poems together, finally finding peace and understanding after many years of bottled-up emotions. As Kat continues to flourish in the world of spoken word poetry, she realizes that the assignment that seemingly forced her to read a poem was, in fact, a serendipitous guide to finding her voice, her purpose, and healing her family.
