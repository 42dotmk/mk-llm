Question: A pack of dogs found a pile of bones in the dumpster behind the butcher shop. One by one, the dogs crawled into the dumpster, grabbed a mouthful of bones, and ran off with their newfound treasure. In all, there were 5 dogs. The first dog carried off 3 bones. The second dog carried off 1 less bone than the first dog. The third dog carried off twice as many as the second dog. The fourth dog carried off one bone, and the fifth dog carried off twice the number of bones as the fourth dog carried, leaving no remaining bones in the dumpster. How many bones were in the original pile of bones?
Answer: The second dog carried off 1 less bone than the first dog, or 3 - 1 = 2 bones. The third dog carried off twice as many bones as the third dog, or 2 * 2 = 4 bones. The fifth dog carried off twice the number of bones as the fourth dog carried, or 2 * 1 = 2 bones. Therefore, the original pile of bones contained 3 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 12 bones. The answer is 12.
[Question]Linda makes $10.00 an hour babysitting. There is a $25.00 application fee for each college application she submits. If she is applying to 6 colleges, how many hours will she need to babysit to cover the application fees?
[Answer]The application fee is $25.00 per college and she is applying to 6 colleges so that's 25 * 6 = $150.00. She makes $10.00 an hour babysitting. Her application fees total $150.00 so she needs to work 150 / 10 = 15 hours to cover the cost. The answer is 15.
Q: A father and a son start approaching each other at the same time from opposite ends of a hallway that is 16m long. If the father is walking three times as fast as the son, at what distance from the father's end of the hallway will they meet?
A: Since the father is walking 3 times as fast as his son, their speeds are in a ratio of 3:1 respectively. They started at the same time so they will cover distance at the same ratio of 3:1. Each portion of the distance they covered is 16 / (3 + 1) = 4m. The father covered three portions of the distance which is 3 * 4m = 12m from his end. The answer is 12.
Question: A quarterback throws 50 passes in one game. He throws twice as many passes to the right of the field than he does to the left of the field. He throws 2 more passes to the center of the field than he did to the left. How many passes did he throw to the left side of the field?
Answer: Let x represent the number of passes thrown to the left side of the field. Right:2x. Center:x + 2. Total:x + 2x + x + 2 = 50. 4x + 2 = 50. 4x = 48. x = 12 passes. The answer is 12.
