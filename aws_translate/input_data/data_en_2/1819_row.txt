Although the two questions appear similar, they have subtle differences in their focus and context. Let's first understand the meaning and intention behind each question before delving into a comprehensive response.

1. What are some of the popular WikiLeaks about India?
This question seeks to know the popular or widely-discussed WikiLeaks releases that are specifically related to India. "Popular" implies that the leaks gained significant media attention, public interest, or had considerable impact on India and its people in general. Popular leaks might not necessarily be limited to issues of power or politics but could encompass various aspects of Indian society.

2. What are some powerful leaks WikiLeaks published about India?
This question, on the other hand, focuses on the impactful or influential WikiLeaks releases pertaining to India. "Powerful" denotes that these leaks have had significant or far-reaching consequences on Indian politics, government, or the nation's image. The focus here lies mainly on the gravity and magnitude of the leaks rather than their popularity quotient.

While there might be an overlap between the popular and powerful leaks, the differentiating factor is the emphasis on the impact and significant consequences in the latter.

Now that we have distinguished the two questions let's discuss both popular and powerful WikiLeaks releases concerning India.

Popular WikiLeaks about India:
1. Indian Swiss Bank Account Holders: WikiLeaks disclosed a list of Indians holding Swiss bank accounts, which fueled a massive debate on black money and corruption in India. The list exposed politicians, businessmen, and others allegedly involved in stashing unaccounted money in Swiss banks.

2. Radia Tapes: The Radia Tapes exposed the close nexus between powerful Indian journalists, politicians, and corporate lobbyists. These tapes contained recorded telephone conversations between the lobbyist Niira Radia and various influential individuals, revealing corruption and manipulation in Indian media and politics.

Powerful leaks WikiLeaks published about India:
1. US Diplomatic cables on India: A series of diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks shed light on the American perspective of Indian politics, government, policies, and internal matters. These cables revealed sensitive information on India’s diplomatic relations, domestic politics, and military strategy, impacting India’s international standing and exposing the private opinions of Indian politicians.

2. Cash-for-votes Scandal: The WikiLeaks cables reported the alleged bribery that took place during a no-confidence motion against the Indian government in 2008. The cables exposed a conversation between a US political counselor and an Indian politician, stating that 4 opposition MPs were offered cash to save the government. This further amplified concerns regarding political corruption in India.

While there is an overlap between popular and powerful leaks in this case, it is essential to note that the emphasis for popular leaks centers on capturing public interest in a broad sense, while powerful leaks stress the consequences and impact on India's politics, governance, and national image.
