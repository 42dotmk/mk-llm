First, let's address each question individually:

Question 1: Has anyone gotten a refund from Ramit Sethi's courses?

Ramit Sethi is a recognized personal finance advisor and author, best known for his book "I Will Teach You To Be Rich" and his online courses related to personal development and business growth. Although I don't have access to specific customer experiences, there are testimonials available online from people who have participated in his courses and shared their feedback.

In general, the satisfaction rate for his courses seems to be high, and many participants express appreciation for the content and the value they received from it. Like any other educational resource, the experience may vary depending on an individual's goals and commitment.

Ramit Sethi's courses often come with a refund policy, which is usually mentioned on the course's sales page or terms and conditions. These policies may include money-back-guarantees within a specific timeframe (e.g., 30 or 60 days) or under specific conditions, like showing proof of having completed the coursework and still not achieving the desired outcomes. Although I cannot confirm specific instances of customers receiving refunds, it is reasonable to believe that some individuals have requested and received refunds if they were not satisfied with the course content or if they did not achieve the anticipated results within the specified time and conditions.

Question 2: Has anyone received a refund from VIT?

VIT refers to Vellore Institute of Technology, a renowned higher education institution in India. Being an educational institution, it is common for universities and colleges to have refund policies in place (though it depends on individual institutions and their specific policies). These policies may be applicable for various reasons, like withdrawal from the course, not being able to attend due to unforeseen circumstances, or not receiving a visa (for international students). 

While I cannot provide specific examples of individuals who have received refunds from VIT, it is highly likely that some students have received refunds based on the refund policies in place. To determine if a refund is available for a particular situation, a student would need to consult the appropriate department or office at VIT to discuss their specific case and the institution's policies.

Regarding whether the answers to these two questions would be the same (i.e., either both being 'yes' or both being 'no'), it is impossible to give an accurate response since Ramit Sethi's courses and VIT are two separate entities with different offerings and refund policies.

In summary:

1. It is likely that some individuals have received refunds from both Ramit Sethi's courses and VIT based on their respective refund policies and individual circumstances.
2. The answers to the two questions may not necessarily be the same, as they refer to different entities and depend on differing contexts.

For more accurate information, it is recommended to consult the respective customer support or administrative departments of Ramit Sethi's courses and VIT regarding their refund policies and procedures.
