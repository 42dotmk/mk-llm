Q: Elvis is releasing a new album with 10 songs, but he doesn't want to waste too much time on writing. He spends 5 hours in the studio, where he writes, records, and edits his songs. Each song takes 12 minutes to record, then it takes 30 minutes to edit all of his songs.  How many minutes did it take Elvis to write each song, if each song took the same amount of time to write?
A: 5 hours in the studio is the same as 5 * 60 = 300 minutes. To record all of his songs, Elvis takes 12 * 10 = 120 minutes. After editing and recording 300 – 120 – 30 = 150 minutes are left to write all of his songs. Songwriting therefore took 150 / 10 = 15 minutes per song. The answer is 15.

[Question]It takes 320 rose petals to make an ounce of perfume. If each rose produces 8 petals, and there are 12 roses per bush, how many bushes will Fern have to harvest to make 20 12-ounce bottles of perfume?
[Answer]First find the number of roses needed for one ounce of perfume: 320 petals / 8 petals / rose = 40 roses. Then multiply the number of roses needed for one ounce by the number of ounces per bottle to find the number of roses per bottle: 40 roses / ounce * 12 ounces / bottle = 480 roses / bottle. Then multiply that number by the number of bottles to find the total number of roses needed: 480 roses / bottle * 20 bottles = 9600 roses. Then divide that number by the number of roses per bush to find the number of bushes Fern needs to harvest: 9600 roses / 12 roses / bush = 800 bushes. The answer is 800.
Q: Lena is making a collage with pictures of all her closest friends and newspaper clippings that are about their interests. She has found three clippings for each friend’s pictures. It takes her six drops of glue to stick down each clipping. Lena has already glued her seven closest friends’ pictures. How many drops of glue will she need for the newspaper clippings for her collage?
A: Lena has 3 clippings per friend, so she has 3 * 7 = 21 clippings to glue. She needs 6 drops of glue per clipping, so she will need 6 * 21 = 126 drops of glue. The answer is 126.
Question: Bruce buys 5 packs of crayons at $5 each, 10 books at $5 each, and 3 calculators at $5 each. If he has $200, how many bags can he buy with the change if one costs $10 each?
