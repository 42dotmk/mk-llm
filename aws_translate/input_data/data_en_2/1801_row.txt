A bachelor's degree is the minimum requirement for most positions; however, obtaining a master's or doctorate degree can significantly improve your standing in the competitive job market.

Beyond your education, gaining experience in the field is crucial. Look for internships, co-op programs, or part-time jobs in the animal health industry while you are still in college.
