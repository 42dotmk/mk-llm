Title: Colombia Plane Crash Survivor Describes Screams of Terror as Plane Went Down - Crew Member Reveals He Survived by Curling into Foetal Position

In a harrowing tale of survival and courage against excruciating odds, a survivor of the recent Colombia plane crash recounts the horrifying moments leading up to the fatal catastrophe. A crew member who miraculously evaded death in the crash reveals that he survived the devastating plunge by adopting a foetal position.

Ernesto Guevara, the heroic crew member, was one of the few to survive the catastrophic accident that claimed many lives. His heartrending account of the flight's last moments provides a poignant testament to the raw fear and dire circumstances that the passengers faced that ill-fated day.

The flight took off on a cloudless morning, with no indication of the disaster to follow. The weather, Guevara recounts, was clear; a perfect day for a flight. However, a short while into their journey, the tranquillity on the plane began to morph into a chilling scene of terror. The aircraft began experiencing severe turbulence as storm clouds swelled around them.

Amid the growing panic, cries of fear, and clattering utensils, something far more sinister became clear - the plane’s rapid descent. Guevara describes the screams of terror filling the cabin as the passengers realized their fate. "The plane pratically started free-falling", he recalls, "and that’s when everyone on board started screaming. It was not just people fearing for their lives, it was their screams of pure terror as we descended, knowing what was to come."

Despite being caught in this hellscape, Guevara's survival instinct kicked into gear. Remembering an old safety procedure - the Brace Position - which has its roots in protecting war pilot trainees and is designed to protect vital body areas in a crash, he instinctively curled into a foetal position. “I took off my seat belt, pushed my seat back as far as possible, and curled up on the floor, drawing my knees up to my chest," he details.

The sight, sounds, and smell of the crash are still frighteningly fresh in his mind. Upon impact, debris scattered. Fire engulfed the broken plane; the cacophony of the crash was overpowered by the intense smell of burning jet fuel and the horrifying sounds of the dying aircraft.

Coming out of the crash, Guevara found himself broken but miraculously alive amidst the chaos and destruction. His decision to adopt the foetal position turned out to be a life-saving move. Researchers have long debated the protective qualities of this controversial position in accidents. Still, in Guevara's case, this position surely reduced the gravitational impact, protected his vital organs, and inevitably played a significant role in his survival. 

Guevara's tale of survival weaves together fear, courage, instinct and a remarkable will to live against all odds. It's a stark reminder of our innate human capacity to survive even when death looms just one breath away. In the midst of despair, the human spirit's tenacity shines through, reminding us that the will to live can make all the difference, even amidst screams of terror and falling aircraft.
