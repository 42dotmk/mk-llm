The sentiment of this sentence can be perceived as negative or critical towards the current state of Hollywood and the film industry. The sentence is expressing an opinion that, although individual elements of a Hollywood production may have great potential, the final output often ends up being less satisfying or successful than one might expect. There are several reasons behind this perception, including the focus on spectacle, challenges in storytelling and character development, the role of marketing, and a reliance on trends rather than originality.

Firstly, spectacle has become a dominant feature in Hollywood films of late. With advances in technology and the growing demand for immersive experiences, many blockbuster movies rely heavily on visual effects, CGI, and action sequences to captivate audiences. While these aspects can indeed offer an exhilarating experience, they may also lead to the neglect of other essential components of storytelling, such as plot and character development. As a result, the film may end up feeling shallow and disconnected despite its impressive visuals.

Another factor contributing to the notion that the whole is less than the sum of its parts in contemporary Hollywood is the challenges in crafting cohesive and engaging stories. A movie may feature a talented cast, high production values, and competent direction, yet still fall short of expectations due to a weak script or inconsistent pacing. It is not uncommon for movies to suffer from convoluted storylines, clich√©d dialogues, or flimsy character motivations, which ultimately detract from the audience's overall enjoyment of the film.

Moreover, marketing plays a significant role in shaping the perception of a movie. Film studios often invest heavily in promotional campaigns that overhype their products, creating unrealistic expectations among potential viewers. This can lead to disappointment, even when a film has all the ingredients for success on paper. In some cases, the marketing materials might reveal major plot points or spoilers, diminishing the impact of the movie when it is finally released.

Lastly, Hollywood's penchant for following trends and producing remakes, sequels, and adaptations can lead to creative stagnation and a lack of originality. With studios playing it safe by relying on established brands, franchises, or previous successes, the end result often becomes formulaic and predictable. This practice can render the whole less satisfying than the sum of its parts, as it fails to harness the full potential of the individual components.

In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence highlights the perceived issues with modern Hollywood films where a focus on spectacle, challenges in storytelling and character development, the influence of marketing, and a reliance on trends rather than originality lead to an end product that falls short of the combined potential of its individual elements. This critical perception suggests that the film industry ought to prioritize a balance of innovative storytelling, creative risk-taking, and strong character development alongside the visually stunning and immersive experiences that Hollywood is known for.
