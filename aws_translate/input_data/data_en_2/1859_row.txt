1. The point of love, even if one day the other person may stop loving you back and walk away, is that love encompasses a range of emotional and mental states that bring about feelings of happiness, security, and well-being. In a more philosophical context, love is considered an essential human emotion and experience that can contribute to personal growth, understanding, and overall quality of life.

The reality in relationships is that sometimes, feelings change, and people grow apart. While it is true that the possibility of the other person walking away exists, that does not necessarily mean you should avoid love altogether. Love leads to many positive experiences and memories that can shape and define your life. In addition, experiencing love and heartbreak can actually provide valuable lessons that make you stronger, more self-aware, and better equipped to forge healthier and stronger relationships in the future.

Part of love is taking the risk, knowing that there is a chance it may not work out, but also understanding that the experience and strength that come from love are worthwhile. People change and grow throughout their lives, and it's important to cherish the moments and memories of love while recognizing that relationships will have their ebbs and flows.

2. When people walk away from love, sadly, it leaves others feeling hurt and in pain. It is normal for those left behind to feel a mix of emotions and, in certain situations, to seek for someone to blame. However, it is essential to consider the reasons and circumstances when someone walks away from a relationship before assigning blame.

Situations and feelings may change with time, and people may outgrow each other. It might become necessary for individuals to love themselves and prioritize their personal growth and well-being, which might mean ending an unhealthy or unfulfilling relationship. In these cases, it may not be fair to place blame on the person who chose to walk away, as these decisions are often difficult and come after much contemplation and inner struggle.

However, there are instances in which someone leaves a relationship because they acted irresponsibly or without much thought for their partner's feelings. In these cases, it's more understandable to feel wronged and to a certain extent, blame the person for their lack of accountability and sensitivity.

Ultimately, understanding the complexities of why love fades is crucial in the healing process. Assigning blame might provide temporary relief, but it is important to seek understanding, self-reflection, and acceptance of the situation to move past those feelings. Engaging in an internal dialogue and talking through your emotions with friends, family, or even a therapist can help offer clarity during this transitional and emotional time.

In conclusion, the two questions are not the same. The first question focuses on the purpose of love even when it might be lost, while the second question emphasizes the implications of assigning blame when someone walks away from love. Both questions, however, allow for meaningful contemplation on the fragile, complex, and ever-evolving connections made through love and relationships.
