Question: Susan has 3 fish tanks to fill. 1 fish tank contains 7 goldfish and 8 beta fish. The second fish tank contains twice as many fish as the first tank and the third fish tank has a third of the number of fish in the second fish tank. How many fish are in the third fish tank?
Answer: In the first fish tank, there are 7 goldfish + 8 beta fish = 15 fish. The second fish tank therefore has 15 fish in the first tank * 2 = 30 fish. So the third tank has 30 fish in the second fish tank / 3 = 10 fish. The answer is 10.
[Question]While preparing balloons for Eva's birthday party, her mom bought 50 balloons and 1800cm続 of helium. One balloon needs 50cm続 to float high enough to touch the ceiling, and she can fill any remaining balloon with ordinary air. If she used up all of the helium and inflated every balloon, how many more balloons are touching the ceiling than not?
[Answer]50cm続 will make one balloon touch the ceiling so 1800cm続 will make 1800 / 50 = 36 balloons touch the ceiling. There are 50 balloons in total so 50 - 36 = 14 balloons will not float since they were filled with ordinary air. There are 36 - 14 = 22 more balloons touching the ceiling than not. The answer is 22.

Question: Alicia has to buy some books for the new school year. She buys 2 math books, 3 art books, and 6 science books, for a total of $30. If both the math and science books cost $3 each, what was the cost of each art book?
Answer: The total cost of maths books is 2 * 3 = 6 dollars. The total cost of science books is 6 * 3 = 18 dollars. The total cost for maths and science books is 6 + 18 = 24 dollars. The cost for art books is 30 - 24 = 6 dollars. Since he bought 3 art books, the cost for each art book will be 6 / 3 = 2 dollars. The answer is 2.
[Question]Jerry needs to shingle 3 roofs. Each roof is made of two slanted rectangular sides measuring 20 feet by 40 feet. If he needs 8 shingles to cover one square foot of roof, how many shingles does he need total?
[Answer]First find the area of one side of a roof: 20 feet * 40 feet = 800 square feet. Then multiply that number by 2 to find the total area of both sides of the roof: 800 square feet / side * 2 sides = 1600 square feet. Then multiply that number by the number of roofs to find the total area of all the roofs: 1600 square feet / roof * 3 roofs = 4800 square feet. Then multiply the total area of the roofs by the number of shingles needed per square foot to find the total number of shingles needed: 4800 square feet * 8 singles / square foot = 38400 shingles. The answer is 38400.
