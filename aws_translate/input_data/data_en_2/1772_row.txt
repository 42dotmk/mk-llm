Q: Harper drinks a 1/2 bottle of mineral water per day. She buys the mineral water by the case at a big box store. They come 24 bottles to a case and are currently on sale for $12.00. If she wants to buy enough cases to last her 240 days, how much will she spend?
A: She drinks 1 / 2 bottle a day and there are 24 bottles in a case so a case will last 24 / .5 = 48 days. She needs enough to last her 240 days and 1 case will last her 48 days so she needs 240 / 48 = 5 cases. Each case is on sale for $12.00 and she needs 5 cases so that's 12 * 5 = $60.00. The answer is 60.
Question: Twice Betty's age is the cost of a pack of nuts. Doug, Betty's friend, is 40 years old. If the sum of their ages is 90, and Betty wants to buy 20 packs of the nuts, calculate the amount of money she'll pay for the packs of nuts.
Answer: If Doug, Betty's friend, is 40 years old, and the sum of their ages is 90, Betty is 90 - 40 = 50 years old. Since twice Betty's age is the cost of a pack of nuts, a pack of nuts is sold at 2 * $50 = $100. If Betty wants to buy 20 packs of the nuts, she'll have to pay 20 * $100 = $2000. The answer is 2000.
[Question]Tom decides to open a theater. He knows it will cost $5 per square foot of space that he needs and he needs 12 square feet for every seat in his theater. He wants a 500 seat theater. He also realizes construction will cost twice as much as the land. He has a partner who covers 40% of the cost. How much does Tom spend?
[Answer]He needs 500 * 12 = 6000 square feet. This means it cost $5 * 6000 = $30,000. That means construction comes to $30000 * 2 = $60,000. So the total cost is $60000 + $30000 = $90,000. His partner covers $90,000 * .4 = $36,000. So he has to pay $90,000 - $36,000 = $54,000. The answer is 54000.
Q: An 18-month magazine subscription is normally $34. The magazine is currently running a promotion for $0.25 off each twice-a-month issue when signing up for the 18-month subscription. How many dollars cheaper is the promotional subscription than the normal one?
A: The subscription sends twice monthly issues, so there are 2 * 18 = 36 issues. Thus, the promotional offer is 36 * 0.25 = $9 cheaper than the normal subscription. The answer is 9.
Question: Taylor and his friends decide to bring their pets together for a walk. 3 of his friends come first, each having twice as many pets as Taylor has. Another two of his friends have 2 pets each. If Taylor has 4 pets, what's the total number of pets they have together?
Answer: If Taylor has 4 pets, and each of his first friends brings twice as much, the total for each friend is 4 * 2 = 8 pets. The total number of pets for Taylor's first friends is 8 * 3 = 24 pets. The other two friends brought two pets each, a total of 2 * 2 = 4 pets. The total number of pets will be Taylor's pets plus his friend's, which is 4 + 4 + 24 = 32 pets. The answer is 32.
