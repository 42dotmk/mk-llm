At the Feminist Art Program at Fresno State College and later at the California Institute of the Arts, Judy Chicago and her students engaged in a groundbreaking exploration of art from a feminist perspective. They aimed to develop a new approach to art that represented and celebrated women's experiences, histories, and contributions to society. To achieve these goals, they undertook various activities and created impactful artworks that have left a lasting mark on the art world. Here's a brief overview of what they did:

1. Skill Development:Chicago taught various artistic skills including needlework, painting, sculpture, and other traditional and non-traditional art forms to empower her students to express their unique feminine perspectives in their work. They also experimented with labor-intensive skills such as welding and pyrotechnics.

2. Collaborative Art Projects: The students in the program worked together on collaborative projects that highlighted women's shared experiences and challenged the societal norms and expectations surrounding womanhood. One such project was Womanhouse, created in collaboration with Miriam Schapiro, which was the first art exhibition space dedicated to presenting art from a female point of view.

3. Reading and Discussion Groups: Chicago and her students held regular reading and discussion groups focused on women's life experiences, feminist theory, and women's history. These discussions helped inform their artistic expression and deepen their understanding of the female experience.

4. Renovation and Maintenance of the Studio Space: The students and Chicago contributed to the renting and refurbishing of an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. By collaborating on the creation and maintenance of their workspace, the students in the program established an environment that was truly supportive of women artists.

5. Founding the Los Angeles Woman's Building: In 1973, Judy Chicago, alongside Arlene Raven and Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, co-founded the Los Angeles Woman's Buildingâ€”an art school, workshop, and exhibition space exclusively for female artists. The establishment of the Woman's Building provided women artists with a supportive and nurturing environment in which to create, learn, and exhibit their work.

6. Developing and Displaying Feminist Art: Under Chicago's guidance and mentorship, students in the program produced a variety of feminist artworks that explored themes such as gender, identity, power, and control. These artworks often incorporated traditional feminine art forms and materials, like needlework and fabric, alongside more conventionally "masculine" techniques like welding and pyrotechnics. By doing so, the artists effectively subverted traditional gender norms and expectations in the art world.

7. Influencing Future Generations: The Feminist Art Program played a significant role in the broader feminist art movement of the 1970s and, in turn, has left a lasting impact on generations of artists who came after them. The program has inspired and influenced numerous artists and art educators to continue examining the role of women in art, culture, and society.
