Title: US Condemns Brutal Violence from Syria's Government: National Security Council Interference Intensifies 

The National Security Council (NSC) has unequivocally denounced the escalating “brutal violence” exerted by the Syrian government against peaceful protesters, as reported by NPR. This comes as a reaction to a sustained government-led crackdown on dissidents seeking democratic and civil liberties in the Middle Eastern nation.

The NSC, in an official statement, dubbed the crackdown as “completely deplorable” and condemned it in the strongest possible terms. This statement from one of America's highest security bodies signifies a serious standpoint against the flagrant human rights violations in Syria and yet another assertive stance by the United States in standing up for global democratic values.

In response to the abuses by Syria’s government, the US stated it is exploring a comprehensive set of policy mechanisms to counter the situation. Highlighted among these are targeted sanctions, designed to put pressure directly on key figures in the Syrian regime without causing unnecessary strain on the general populace who are already subjected to traumatic experiences.

The officials from the NSC voiced their support for the protesters who have remained resilient and unwavering in their call for freedom of expression, assembly, association, and the ability to freely choose their leaders. This sentiment communicates that the global superpower stands firmly behind the principles of democracy, asserting that the voices of Syrian protesters "must be heard."

While the government's crackdown in Syria is ongoing, a remarkable shift appears to be taking shape within Syria’s army. Notably, soldiers are reportedly increasingly expressing opposition to the violence against protesters. There have been reports of some military personnel in Daraa explicitly refusing to fire on demonstrators — not as isolated instances, but as part of a broader trend. 

This trend is causing concern among Syria’s leaders, as it points to a potential division within the military — the backbone of the regime. There have been chilling reports that some military officials who sided with the protesters have been assassinated, casting a shadow over the loyalty of the army to the incumbent government.

Nicholas Blanford, writing for the Christian Science Monitor, suggests that such a division within the army could “cast serious doubt” on the government's “ability to survive.” The implication is that a split within the military could destabilize the authoritarian government's iron clad hold on power, thereby accelerating its potential collapse.

As the situation develops, the international community and particularly the U.S., through the National Security Council, continues to monitor the situation closely. The emphasis remains on ensuring respect for human rights and democratic values and the pursuit of possible policy options to expedite a resolution to the crisis in Syria. The courage of the Syrian people, as they continue to call out for their freedoms amidst the brutal crackdown, has not gone unnoticed and contributions toward their cause continue to intensify.
