The Perseverance of a Serial Stowaway: Marilyn Hartman's Unrelenting Attempts to Sneak Onto Airplanes

Despite numerous arrests and ongoing legal trouble, Marilyn Hartman, a 63-year-old woman infamously known as the "serial stowaway," has exhibited an unwavering determination to sneak onto airplanes. Recently, she was arrested twice more for loitering in terminal areas at Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports, where she was charged with misdemeanor criminal trespassing on state land. While her persistence may seem bewildering to some, her story raises important questions about the underlying factors that contribute to her compulsive behavior and her quest for a sense of belonging.

Hartman's history of attempting to board planes without tickets dates back to February last year, when she made three separate attempts to stow away to Hawaii from San Francisco. Miraculously, she managed to board a plane on her first try, only to be caught and released two more times as she persisted in her endeavors. Despite spending eight days in jail for her third attempt, the time spent in custody wasn't enough to dissuade her from continuing her flight-crashing pursuits.

In August, she scored a small victory by successfully flying from San Jose to Los Angeles without a ticket. However, she was promptly arrested upon arrival in LA and subsequently ordered by the court to stay away from airports unless she had a boarding pass. Unfazed, she returned to the Los Angeles International Airport just a few hours later, only to be arrested again and sent back to jail.

Evidently, neither imprisonment nor court orders could hinder Hartman's ambition. After being released from jail, her wanderlust led her to Phoenix, where she was once again arrested for loitering in the airport. Then, in February, she allegedly flew from Minnesota to Florida without a ticket - an impressive yet unlawful feat that resulted in her arrest once more.

Although Hartman's exploits may appear to be the work of a cunning and daring individual, those who have had the opportunity to engage with her closely suggest that there might be more at play beneath the surface. Advocates for homeless people who suffer from mental illness believe that her behavior could be indicative of an unmet mental health need.

"What needs to happen is for someone—a doctor, probably—to sit down with her and find out what she needs that she's not getting," one advocate told the San Francisco Chronicle. And considering her frequent encounters with law enforcement and the criminal justice system, it seems evident that a more comprehensive and compassionate approach might be necessary to better understand and address her relentless quest to fly.

As of now, Hartman remains in custody following her latest struggle with Chicago airport security. While it is unclear how her story will unfold in the future, it is evident that her saga offers an invaluable insight into the importance of mental health awareness and the potential consequences of untreated mental illness. For now, one can only hope that Hartman finds the appropriate care and resources needed to navigate her life in a more constructive and legal manner.
