B. symphony was so lavishly funded.

By any measure, the opera was a disaster compared to the symphony, as the symphony was so lavishly funded. The management had spared no expense in ensuring that every element of the symphony was taken care of, down to the minutest detail. The orchestra had been given the best possible instruments, and they'd invited renowned musicians worldwide to join their ranks. Some of them, like the first-chair violinist and the soloist soprano, had agreed to generous sums to secure their talents.

The costumes for the symphony's performers were designed and tailored by the most skilled artisans in the industry, and each piece was adorned with a plethora of exquisite details that would sparkle under the stage lights. The stage itself was host to magnificent backdrops and extravagant props that created an enchanting atmosphere for the audience to step into. The lighting and sound design alone were of the highest quality available, ensuring that each musician could convey their movements and melodies in perfect harmony with one another.

In contrast, the opera's production felt bare-boned and lifeless. With a meager budget to work with, the team was left to scrounge for whatever money they could, with neither the management nor the patrons seeing much value in the production – a fact that became apparent upon attending the performances. The costumes, if they could be called that, were made from low-quality materials and barely held together, falling apart at the seams with every step the performers took on stage.

The stage set could hardly be compared to the symphony's – minimal at best, consisting of a few painted flats that didn't do much to convince the audience of a different place or time. For the musicians and singers, there were none of the stellar performers the symphony boasted. Instead, they had a ragtag group of undertrained local artists who might have been passionate about their craft but lacked the prestige and skill that their counterparts in the symphony possessed.

As the performances unfolded, it was obvious to all but the most oblivious observer that the opera stood little chance of success in the shadow of the spectacular symphony. The audience for the opera was often left wondering what could have been, had they been able to see a production on par with that of the symphony's. The singers and musicians, despite their best efforts, were unable to perform at their fullest potential, hindered as they were by the dire lack of funding and support.

Throughout the run, the symphony continued to amass accolades and admiration from local and international critics alike. The opera, on the other hand, limped along for a few more performances before it was shuttered for good. The cast and crew disbanded, the production assets sold off, and the once-promising idea of the opera was relegated to the annals of history.

In a world where resources were limited, and where art had to compete against commerce and politics, the symphony emerged victorious. The opera was an unfortunate casualty of that struggle, a sad reminder that sometimes, no matter how grand, the underdog won't always gain the recognition it deserves.
