Title: "Leap of Legends: The Rise of Tars and Carter"

Plot:

In the distant world of Barsoom, the lively city of Zodanga prospers under the rule of the wise and just leader, Tars Tarkas. Although the Martian city has known peace for decades, rumors of an upcoming challenge to Tarkas's rule have begun to surface. Amidst the political tension, Tars Tarkas visits a local tavern, seeking solace in anonymity. It is here that he stumbles upon an unbelievable secret: a man has arrived in their world with extraordinary abilities, hailing from the far-off planet Earth - a man named John Carter.

The film opens with Tars Tarkas stumbling upon Carter as he singlehandedly saves a group of Martians from a terrible disaster merely by utilizing his incredible jumping capabilities. Intrigued and realizing that Carter's abilities could be the key to maintaining peace in Zodanga, Tars Tarkas decides to strike a friendship with the Earthman.

Parallel to these events, the villainous Sab Than, bolstered by the power-hungry Matai Shang, secretly plots to overthrow Tars Tarkas and take control of Zodanga. Capitalizing on the people's growing unease and resentment towards the newcomers, Sab Than presents himself as the champion of true Martians and begins to rally an army to usurp the throne.

As Tars Tarkas works to gain Carter's trust and convince him to use his powers to defend Zodanga, Carter must grapple with a newfound responsibility to a world he never expected to be a part of. Along the way, Carter meets Dejah Thoris, a Zodangan princess who is immediately fascinated by Carterâ€™s strange origins and incredible abilities. With her knowledge of Martian science, she helps Carter comprehend the extent of his powers and why he has them in Barsoom.

As friendship turns into love, Dejah Thoris's brother Kantos Kan is wrongfully accused of aiding Sab Than's treacherous schemes. To prove his innocence and unmask Sab Than's true intentions, Carter agrees to put his abilities to the test in an awe-inspiring display at Zodanga's annual "Festival of Legends."

On the fateful day of the event, Carter, flanked by Dejah Thoris and Tars Tarkas, triumphantly showcases his powers, marveling the audience. However, Sab Than and Matai Shang anticipated the spectacle and use the chaos that ensues during John Carter's performance to mobilize their coup.

A climactic battle sees Tars Tarkas, John Carter, and their loyalists fighting off Sab Than and his forces. With the help of his exceptional jumping abilities, Carter manages to defeat Sab Than in a one-on-one duel. Matai Shang is also captured and put on trial for his crimes, leading Tars Tarkas to resume his position as the ruler of Zodanga.

In the aftermath of the battle, John Carter is commended as a hero and officially welcomed by the people of Zodanga. He and Dejah Thoris become happily married, and Carter vows to use his powers to protect both Earth and Barsoom.
