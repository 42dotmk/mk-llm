Matthias has rallied people from all over the planet in their fight against the powerful and tyrannical Cohaagan, the planet's dictator, and his military forces known as The Enforcers.

Cohaagan has enjoyed unchallenged rule over Terrastra for decades, harnessing the planet's rare mineral resources for his own benefit and propagandizing the usefulness of his regime. As the divide between the wealthy and the impoverished deepens, the unrest surrounding Matthias' movement reaches its boiling point.

One fateful day, however, Matthias is found dead in his safe house, sparking chaos and confusion amongst The Flux. Who could have gotten to their fiercely protected leader? Almost immediately, fingers point towards Cohaagan and his Enforcers as the masterminds behind the assassination.

Seeking to unravel the truth, Dana Gray, a young, talented investigator within The Flux, and Noah Kash, a former Enforcer with a disdain for Cohaagan's brutal regime, forge an unexpected alliance to uncover who killed Matthias. Rumors and speculations spread like wildfire, inciting chaos and mistrust among the people, which ultimately plays into Cohaagan's hands.

They gradually unearth that Matthias' assassination may have resulted from a vast conspiracy infiltrated by a double agent from within the heart of The Flux.

As Dana and Noah get closer to identifying the mole, they stumble upon a shocking revelation that implicates some of the most trusted individuals within The Flux, triggering a struggle for power and trust within the movement. Meanwhile, they uncover that Cohaagan had orchestrated part of this intricate web of deceit in an attempt to eliminate Matthias, who had stumbled upon an explosive secret that could topple Cohaagan's reign.

In the climax of the story, our heroes finally expose the mole, dismantle Cohaagan's plan to control Terrastra, and bring retribution for the murder of Matthias.
