Q: Carla is dividing up chores for her two kids, Anna and Billy. She wants each of them to spend the same number of minutes working. Sweeping takes 3 minutes per room, washing the dishes takes 2 minutes per dish, and doing laundry takes 9 minutes per load. If Anna does the sweeping for 10 rooms and Billy does two loads of laundry, how many dishes should Billy wash so they spend the same amount of time doing chores?
A: First find the total time Billy spends on laundry: 2 loads * 9 minutes / load = 18 minutes. Then find the total time Anna spends sweeping: 3 minutes / room * 10 rooms = 30 minutes. Then find how much longer Anna has already worked than Billy: 30 minutes - 18 minutes = 12 minutes. Then divide the difference in work time by the time to wash one dish to find the number of dishes Billy has to wash to work the same amount of time as Anna: 12 minutes / 2 minutes / dish = 6 dishes. The answer is 6.
Question: Benny has bought a new piggy bank and wants to start saving money. In January he adds $19, then adds the same amount in February. By the end of March, he has $46. How many dollars did he add to the piggy bank in March?
Answer: In January and February, Benny added 19 + 19 = $38 to the piggy bank. Calculating the difference between this and the total he has at the end of March shows that he saved 46 â€“ 38 = $8 in March. The answer is 8.

[Answer]She needs 60 ounces of food because 30 / .5 = 60. She needs 4 jars of food because 60 / 15 = 4. It will cost $8 to feed them because 4 x 2 = 8. The answer is 8.
Q: Jules is walking dogs to help pay for his family's vacation. The vacation costs $1,000. There are five members in his family and each one must contribute the same amount towards the vacation cost. He charges $2 to start a walk and $1.25 per block. If he walks 20 dogs, how many blocks in total does he have to walk them?
A: Jules has to earn $200 because 1000 / 5 = 200. He has earned $40 from starting the walks because 20 x 2 = 40. He has to earn $160 from distance, because 200 - 40 = 160. He has to walk 128 blocks because 160 / 1.25 = 128. The answer is 128.
Question: Van Helsing gets paid by the town to remove all the vampires and werewolves. He gets $5 per vampire and $10 per werewolf. He removes half the vampires and removes 8 werewolves, and earned $105. There were 4 times as many werewolves as vampires. What percentage of the werewolves did he remove?
Answer: He earns $80 from werewolf removal because 8 x 10 = 80. He earned $25 from vampire removal because 105 - 80 = 25. He removed 5 vampires from town because 25 / 5 = 5. There were 10 vampires because 5 / .5 = 10. There were 40 werewolves because 4 x 10 = 40. The proportion of werewolves that he removed was .2 because 8 / 40 = .2. The percentage of werewolves removed was 20% because 100 x .2 = 20. The answer is 20.
