Given the context provided, it can be inferred that Addison would likely feel a variety of emotions and physical sensations after eating tacos at the park and getting full quickly. We must consider multiple factors to explore the possible feelings Addison might experience.

Firstly, let's consider the physical sensations that Addison would experience as a result of eating tacos and getting full rapidly. When a person consumes food quickly and becomes full, they might encounter feelings of discomfort or bloating. It is also possible that Addison could feel lethargic after eating a filling meal. This could lead to a decreased inclination towards participating in any physical activities in the park or engaging in social interactions with others.

Secondly, let's examine the emotional aspect. Depending on the circumstances surrounding Addison's decision to eat tacos, several emotions might come into play following the meal. If Addison had been craving tacos and was excited at the prospect of eating them, they might initially feel satisfied and content once they have satisfied their craving. However, if the overly full sensation becomes unpleasant, Addison might experience a range of negative emotions, such as regret or disappointment in overeating or eating too quickly. Additionally, if they were eating in the company of friends or family, they might feel self-conscious or embarrassed about suddenly feeling full or uncomfortable.

Moreover, it's essential to consider the context and environment in which Addison ate the tacos. The park setting might contribute to their feelings in different ways. If the weather was pleasant and the park's atmosphere was relaxing, Addison might feel more inclined to find a soothing place to sit or lie down and let their fullness subside. On the other hand, if the park was crowded, noisy, or chaotic, they might feel overwhelmed or agitated, especially if they are already experiencing physical discomfort from their meal.

Lastly, Addison's personal disposition and temperament would also play a role in how they feel after consuming the tacos. If they are generally an optimistic and resilient person, they might be more capable of managing the physical discomfort and focusing on the positive aspects of their experience, such as the enjoyment of a satisfying meal or the opportunity to spend time outdoors in the park. Conversely, if they are more inclined to dwell on negative feelings or have had a stressful day, the discomfort of getting full quickly could exacerbate their negative emotions and impact their overall mood.

In conclusion, while it is difficult to pinpoint precisely how Addison would feel after rapidly becoming full from eating tacos at the park, it is likely that they would experience a mixture of physical sensations and emotions. Factors such as their personal disposition, the circumstances surrounding their meal, and the environment of the park would all play a role in shaping their feelings. Ultimately, one could expect a combination of physical discomfort due to the fullness, emotional contentment from satisfying a craving, and potential regret or disappointment depending on various external factors.
