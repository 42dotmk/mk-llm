Q: Hannah is making banana bread. She needs to use 3 cups of flour for every cup of banana mush. It takes 4 bananas to make one cup of mush. If Hannah uses 20 bananas, how many cups of flour should she use?
A: First find the number of cups of banana mush Hannah gets: 20 bananas / 4 bananas / cup = 5 cups. Then multiply the number of cups of mush by the ratio of flour to mush to find the number of cups of flour: 5 cups mush * 3 cups flour / 1 cup mush = 15 cups flour. The answer is 15.

[Question]Lilith originally had five dozen water bottles that she needed to sell at $2 each to get exactly enough money to buy her friend a birthday gift. However, at the store, Lilith realized she could not sell at $2 because the regular price was $1.85 per water bottle in her town, and she had to reduce her price to $1.85 as well to sell her water bottles. Calculate the total amount of money Lilith will have to find to buy her friend the birthday gift after selling her water bottles at the reduced cost.
[Answer]Lilith had 5 dozen water bottles, and since a dozen has 12 water bottles, the total number of water bottles she had was 12 bottles / dozen * 5 dozen = 60 bottles. To buy her friend the birthday gift, Lilith originally had to sell her water bottles for a total of 60 bottles * $2 / bottle = $120. When she reduced the price to $1.85 to meet the regular price, the total amount of money she had from the sales was $1.85 / bottle * 60 bottles = $111. To buy her friend the birthday gift, Lilith has to find $120 - $111 = $9 more. The answer is 9.
Q: Jennifer purchased 40 cans of milk at the store before meeting her classmate Mark, who was also buying milk. Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for every 5 cans Mark bought. If Mark purchased 50 cans, how many cans of milk did Jennifer bring home from the store?
A: If Mark bought 50 cans of milk, the number of times Jennifer added 6 cans for every 5 that Mark bought is 50 / 5 = 10 times. The total number of additional cans she bought is 10 * 6 = 60 cans. If she initially had 40 cans, she went home with 40 + 60 = 100 cans of milk. The answer is 100.
Question: Every day, Sara bakes 10 cakes and puts them in his refrigerator. He does this for 5 days. Carol then comes over and eats 12 of his cakes. If it takes 2 cans of frosting to frost a single cake, how many cans of frosting does Bob need to frost the remaining cakes?
Answer: After 5 days, Sara has baked 5 days * 10 cakes / day = 50 cakes. After Carol's feast, there are 50 cakes - 12 cakes = 38 cakes remaining. Sara needs 2 cans / cake * 38 cakes = 76 cans of frosting. The answer is 76.
