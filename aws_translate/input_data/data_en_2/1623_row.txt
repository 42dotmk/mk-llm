q... By the end of 2014, the total installed global power generating capacity is nearly 6.142 TW (million MW) which does not include the DG sets not connected to local electricity grids. In 2014, world energy consumption for electricity generation was coal 40.8 %, natural gas 21.6 %, nuclear 10.6 %, hydro 16.4 %,' others' (solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, etc.) 6.3 % and oil 4.3 %. Coal and natural gas were the most popular energy fuels for generating electricity. The world's electricity consumption was 18,608 TWh in 2012. This figure is about 18 % smaller than the generated electricity, due to grid losses, storage losses, and self-consumption from power plants (gross generation). Cogeneration (CHP) power stations use some of the energy that is otherwise wasted for heating buildings or in industrial processes.

Answer this question: what percentage of the world's electricity is supplied by coal?
a... The relevant information is: In 2014, world energy consumption for electricity generation was coal 40.8 %, natural gas 21.6 %, nuclear 10.6 %, hydro 16.4 %,' others' (solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, etc.) 6.3 % and oil 4.3 %.
The answer is 40.8

q... Lens speed refers to the maximum aperture diameter, or minimum f-number, of a photographic lens. A lens with a larger maximum aperture (that is, a smaller minimum f-number) is called a "fast lens" because it can achieve the same exposure with a faster shutter speed. Conversely, a smaller maximum aperture (larger minimum f-number) is "slow" because it delivers less light intensity and requires a slower (longer) shutter speed.

What does the speed of a lens mean?
a...
