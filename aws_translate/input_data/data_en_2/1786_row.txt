Q: Emma bought a loaf of bread that had a certain number of slices. Her little cousin Andy ate 3 slices from the bread at two different points in time, and then Emma decided she would make toast with the remaining slices. If she uses 2 slices of bread to make 1 piece of toast bread, how many slices were in the original loaf if she was able to make 10 pieces of toast bread and had 1 slice of bread left?
A: Little Andy ate 3 slices 2 times giving a total of 3 * 2 = 6 slices of bread. 1 piece of toast bread requires 2 slices of bread so 10 pieces need 10 * 2 = 20 slices of bread. There is 1 slice of bread left so in total there were 6 + 20 + 1 = 27 slices of bread in the loaf. The answer is 27.
Question: Sean designs and sells patches. He orders his patches in a unit of 100 and is charged $1.25 per patch. If he turns around and sells all 100 patches for $12.00 each, what is his net profit?
Answer: He orders 100 patches and they cost $1.25 each so the patches are 100 * 1.25 = $125.00. He sells each of the 100 patches for $12.00 each so he makes 100 * 12 = $1,200.00. He makes $1,200.00 selling patches and spends $125.00 to have them made so his net profit is 1200 - 125 = $1,075.00. The answer is 1075.
[Question]Caden has four jars of coins. One jar of pennies, one jar of nickels, one jar of dimes and one jar of quarters. He has twice as many quarters as he does dimes. He has five times as many nickels as he does dimes. He has three times as many pennies as he does nickels. If he has 120 pennies, how much money does he have?
[Answer]Starting with 120 pennies he has $1.20. If he has three times as many pennies as he does nickels, he has 120 pennies / 3 nickels per penny = 40 nickels. 40 nickels = 40 * $0.05 = $2. If he has five times as many nickels as dimes he has 40 nickels / 5 dimes per nickel = 8 dimes. 8 * $0.10 = $0.80. if he has twice as many quarters than he does dimes, he has 8 dimes * 2 quarters per dime = 16 quarters = 16 * $ 0.25 = $4.00. In all he has $1.20 + $2.00 + $0.80 + $4.00 = $8.00. The answer is 8.
Q: If Katherine has 4 apples and 3 times as many pears in her fridge, how many bananas does she have if she has a total of 21 pieces of fruit?
A: Katherine has a total of 3 * 4 apples = 12 pears. She therefore had 4 apples + 12 pears = 16 apples and pears. We know she has 21 total pieces of fruit, so this means she must have 21 total - 16 = 5 bananas. The answer is 5.
Question: Yuko likes to play board games. He decides to play a game with his brother Yuri. They must roll 3 dice at the same time and move the squares corresponding to the value of the 3 dice. Yuri started and his dice had the following combination: 2, 4, and 5. On Yuko's turn, he rolled 1, 5, and X. How many squares must Yuko's last die move him so that he is in front of his brother?
Answer: The sum of Yuri's dice gave, 2 + 4 + 5 = 11 squares. For Yuko to get the same sum in the dice, 1 + 5 + X = 11 squares. Solving the equation, X = 11 - 6, X = 5 squares. To stand in front of his brother, Yuko needs to be at least 1 place in front, so his last die will move him, 5 + 1 = 6 squares. The answer is 6.
