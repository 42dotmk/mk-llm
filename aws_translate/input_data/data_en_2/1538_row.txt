A judge plays a crucial role in the criminal justice system when someone is convicted of a crime. Out of the given options, the most accurate answer is "pass sentence."

A judge's primary responsibility in a criminal trial is to ensure that the proceedings are conducted fairly and in accordance with the law. They need to uphold the rights of both the prosecution and the defense, as well as ensure that all procedures and legalities are followed strictly. The judge's role typically includes the following:

1. Conducting the trial: The judge oversees the trial proceedings, deciding on issues of law and making rulings on evidentiary matters. They provide instructions to the jury (if present) on the applicable law and ensure that the trial progresses smoothly.

2. Enforcing courtroom decorum: The judge enforces the rules of courtroom etiquette and decorum, maintaining a respectful atmosphere in the court.

3. Reviewing legal submissions: The judge reviews the arguments and evidence submitted by both parties. They may seek clarifications, ask questions, and even call for additional information if needed.

4. Ensuring impartiality: The judge guarantees that all parties involved in the trial are treated fairly and impartially, regardless of their social, economic, or political backgrounds.

5. Providing legal guidance: The judge instructs the jury about the law and the elements of the offense the defendant is charged with. They also clarify the burden of proof and the legal standard for a conviction.

When a defendant is convicted of a crime (usually, this means that either they have admitted guilt by pleading guilty or the jury has found them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt), the judge's subsequent responsibilities include:

1. Determining the appropriate sentence: The judge, after considering the facts of the case, the crime committed, and any mitigating or aggravating factors, will decide on a suitable punishment in accordance with the sentencing laws. This may include incarceration, probation, fines, community service, and other forms of punishment.

2. Pronouncing the sentence: The judge formally announces the punishment in open court, providing an explanation for their decision. They will also inform the defendant of their rights to appeal the conviction and/or sentence.

3. Ensuring due process: The judge ensures that all legal requirements are met throughout the entire process, including the sentencing phase. This is essential to protect the defendant's rights and guarantee a fair trial.

4. Facilitating rehabilitation: In many cases, judges also play a role in encouraging or facilitating the rehabilitation of the convicted individual. This could include recommending appropriate programs, services, or interventions aimed at reducing the likelihood of reoffending.

In conclusion, the primary duty of a judge when a defendant is convicted of a crime is to pass the sentence in accordance with the legal system's guidelines and regulations. This not only serves justice by holding the convicted individual accountable but also ensures that the punishment is fair, proportionate, and effective in preventing crime and promoting rehabilitation.
