Angel Island State Park is accessible from several marinas in the San Francisco Bay, including Tiburon, Sausalito, and San Francisco's Marina District.

Step 2: Navigating the Waters

As you embark on your journey, be mindful of the various navigational aids that guide you through the intricate waterways of the San Francisco Bay. Use navigational charts, GPS, or even mobile applications to help plot your course and preserve your bearings. Always maintain a safe speed and a proper lookout to avoid hazards and other boats.

Step 3: Approaching Ayala Cove

Upon reaching Angel Island, keep a lookout for the official park signage that will direct you to Ayala Cove.

As you approach the cove, you will notice the scenic docks nestled against the beautiful backdrop of the island's lush greenery.

Step 4: Docking Your Boat

As you enter Ayala Cove, prepare for docking your boat. Ayala Cove's docks feature ample space for your boat, but it is essential to approach slowly and be prepared to maneuver around other boats, if necessary. The park staff often provide guidance on docking procedures, so maintain open communication with them via VHF radio.

Ensure that all your ropes, fenders, and docking equipment are ready and that your crew is well-versed in their roles. The goal is to approach the dock in a controlled manner to prevent any damage to your boat or the dock. The docking process may take several attempts, but remain patient and stay focused.

Step 5: Mooring Your Boat

Once your boat is securely docked, it's time to moor it to prevent any drifting while you explore the island. Using the mooring lines, secure your boat to the cleats provided on the dock. Double-check the tightness and reliability of your knots and make any necessary adjustments. Some boats at Ayala Cove may use the park's mooring balls, which offer additional security.
