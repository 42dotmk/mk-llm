[Question]Sansa is a famous artist, she can draw a portrait and sell it according to its size. She sells an 8-inch portrait for $5, and a 16-inch portrait for twice the price of the 8-inch portrait. If she sells three 8-inch portraits and five 16-inch portraits per day, how many does she earns every 3 days?
[Answer]Sansa earns $5 x 3 = $15 every day by selling three 8 - inch portraits. The price of the 16 - inch portrait is $5 x 2 = $10 each. So, she earns $10 x 5 = $50 every day by selling five 16 - inch portraits. Her total earnings is $50 + $15 = $65 every day. Therefore, the total amount she earns after 3 days is $65 x 3 = $195. The answer is 195.

[Answer]Ann had 3 dozen oatmeal cookies - 2 dozen = 1 dozen oatmeal cookies left. Ann had 2 dozen sugar cookies - 1.5 dozen = .5 dozen sugar cookies left. Ann had 4 dozen chocolate chip cookies - 2.5 dozen = 1.5 dozen chocolate chip cookies left. Ann has a total of 1 + .5 + 1.5 dozen cookies = 3 dozen cookies. 3 dozen cookies is 3 * 12 cookies = 36 cookies remaining. The answer is 36.
Q: Nina loves to travel. She tries to travel at least 400 kilometers in one month outside of her home country. Every second month she does twice that distance. If she were able to keep up with her resolution, how many kilometers would she travel during 2 years?
A: Every second month Nina does twice the regular distance, which means 400 * 2 = 800 kilometers. Two years is 24 months, so half of this time is 24 * 0.5 = 12 months. So in 12 months Nina does 400 * 12 = 4800 kilometers. And in the other 12 months, she does 800 * 12 = 9600 kilometers. So in two years, Nina would be able to make 4800 + 9600 = 14400 kilometers. The answer is 14400.
