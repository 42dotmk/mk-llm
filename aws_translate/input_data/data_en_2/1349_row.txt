Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the KPMG study focused on high tech, high value, and pharmaceutical industries, all of which have experienced significant growth. The hon. member emphasizes that the growth of these industries can be traced back to the government's research and development (R&D) policies.

The KPMG study, as referenced, seems to have analyzed these specific industries and determined their growth trajectories, paying attention to factors that contributed to their successes. The mention of the government's R&D policies by the hon. member suggests that these policies played a crucial role in fostering an environment conducive for growth and innovation within these sectors.

The government's R&D policies might have included a range of measures, such as:

1. Financial support: This could involve the allocation of funds to businesses and institutions involved in R&D in the form of grants, tax credits, or other financial incentives. These resources would enable organizations to invest in cutting-edge research and technologies, helping them stay competitive and contribute to overall industry growth.

2. Intellectual property protection: Robust policies to safeguard inventions, patents, and other intellectual property rights are crucial in promoting innovation. By ensuring that businesses can protect their ideas, the government may encourage more risk-taking and investment into R&D.

3. Collaboration and partnerships: The government's policies might also have promoted collaborations between the private sector, universities, and research institutions. Joint research and partnership is often a key driver of innovation, enabling the sharing of resources, knowledge, and expertise to fast-track the development of new products and solutions.

4. Education and talent development: Governments play a central role in ensuring that industries have access to a skilled workforce by investing in education and training programs related to high tech, high value, and pharmaceutical industries. Fostering talent is essential for driving ongoing innovation and success in these sectors.

5. Infrastructure development: Government policies may also have provided support for crucial infrastructure, such as research facilities, labs, and technology hubs, fostering the growth of the industries concerned.

6. Market access and trade: Government policies in market access and international trade can also benefit the growth of specific industries, especially by opening up new markets and lowering barriers to entry for businesses.

In conclusion, based on the information presented, it can be inferred that the KPMG study appears to show a link between the government's policies and the growth and success of the high tech, high value, and pharmaceutical industries. The exact details of the study and the policies in question would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the government's contributions to the industries' growth. However, based on what has been shared, the overall conclusion seems to support the view that the government's R&D policies have played a significant role in the advancement of these industries.
