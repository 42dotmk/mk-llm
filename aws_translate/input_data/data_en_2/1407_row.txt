Whitewater, California is a small community located in Riverside County, near Palm Springs. The water supply in Whitewater comes from various sources, including local groundwater, imported water, and the Whitewater River. A detailed explanation of each source is provided below.

1. Local Groundwater:
Whitewater, like many communities in Riverside County, relies on local groundwater as a major source of its water supply. The groundwater comes from underground aquifers, which are natural reservoirs of water stored in permeable rock formations beneath the Earth's surface. These aquifers are replenished through a process called groundwater recharge, where water from precipitation, snowmelt, and runoff percolates through the soil and collects in the aquifer.

In Whitewater, the primary aquifers are located in the San Gorgonio Pass Groundwater Basin and the Upper Coachella Valley Groundwater Basin. Through wells and pumping stations, water is extracted from these aquifers and transported to the community for their drinking, sanitation, and irrigation needs.

2. Imported Water:
In addition to relying on local groundwater, Whitewater also receives imported water from other sources. This imported water is primarily sourced from the State Water Project (SWP) and the Colorado River Aqueduct (CRA). 

The SWP is a network of reservoirs, aqueducts, and pumping stations that deliver water from Northern California to Southern California. Whitewater receives a portion of its water supply from Lake Perris, a major reservoir in the SWP, which is managed by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWDSC) and the Eastern Municipal Water District (EMWD).

The CRA is a 242-mile-long aqueduct system that transports water from the Colorado River to Southern California. Managed by the MWDSC, the CRA provides water to Whitewater as part of the desert region's water allocation. The imported water from both the SWP and CRA is used to supplement local groundwater resources, ensuring a reliable water supply for the community.

3. Whitewater River:
The Whitewater River also serves as a vital water source for the community. Originating from the San Gorgonio Wilderness, the river flows southwest through the San Gorgonio Pass, passing through the community of Whitewater before eventually joining the Coachella Valley Stormwater Channel. 

The Whitewater River helps recharge local groundwater basins through natural percolation as well as a process called "spreading," where water from the river is diverted to recharge basins to infiltrate the ground and replenish the aquifers. The local water agencies, like the Coachella Valley Water District (CVWD) and the Desert Water Agency (DWA), operate these spreading facilities along the Whitewater River for groundwater replenishment purposes.

In summary, the water supply in Whitewater, California comes from a combination of local groundwater, imported water from the State Water Project and the Colorado River Aqueduct, and the Whitewater River. All these sources work together to ensure a reliable water supply for the community's needs while maintaining the health and sustainability of the local environment.
