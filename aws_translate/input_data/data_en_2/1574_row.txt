Reasoning and answer: Whitney is buying 2 posters for $5 each, so the posters will cost 2 * $5 = $10 total cost for posters. Whitney is buying 3 notebooks for $4 each, so the notebooks will cost 3 * $4 = $12 total cost for notebooks. Whitney is buying 2 notebooks for $2, so the bookmarks 2 * $2 = $4 total cost for bookmarks. Since Whitney is paying $10 for posters, $12 for notebooks, and $4 for bookmarks, her total purchase will cost $10 + $12 + $4 = $26 total purchase cost. Whitney’s mom gave her 2 $20 bills, so she will be paying with 2 * $20 = $40 total payment. Since Whitney is paying with $40 and her purchase cost will be $26, she will have $40 - $26 = $14 left over after the purchase.
The answer: 14

Reasoning and answer: The second earthquake caused 2 * 4 = 8 buildings to collapse. The third earthquake caused 2 * 8 = 16 buildings to collapse. The fourth earthquake caused 16 * 2 = 32 buildings to collapse. Including the first earthquake, the earthquakes caused 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 60 buildings to collapse.
The answer: 60
What was the question?
Question: An earthquake caused four buildings to collapse. Experts predicted that each following earthquake would have double the number of collapsing buildings as the previous one, since each one would make the foundations less stable. After three more earthquakes, how many buildings had collapsed including those from the first earthquake?
