It is true that, with the recent entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Parliament will need, overall, additional capacities for administrative work. However, after the introduction of the status of assistants at the beginning of the current legislature, we still do not have clear evidence that more assistants are needed.

The Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on December 1, 2009, brought significant changes to the functioning of the European Union and its institutions, including the European Parliament. One of the main objectives of the treaty was to enhance the democratic legitimacy of the EU by strengthening the role of the European Parliament in decision-making processes and increasing its powers in areas such as legislative and budgetary matters, foreign and security policy, and appointment procedures for high-level EU officeholders.

As a result of this increased role, the Parliament is indeed faced with a higher workload and more complex administrative tasks, meaning that it requires additional resources, including staff and administrative capacities, to effectively carry out its duties.

With regard to the status of assistants, it is important to differentiate between different types of staff that work for the European Parliament. There are Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) and their personal staff, who are also known as parliamentary assistants. These assistants are directly employed by MEPs to support them in their daily tasks and legislative activities. At the beginning of the current legislative term, the status of parliamentary assistants was introduced, along with rules governing their employment conditions, duties, and obligations, in an effort to ensure a more transparent and professional relationship between MEPs and their assistants.

While it has been acknowledged that the Treaty of Lisbon has led to a higher workload for the European Parliament and its Members, it is not immediately clear whether this increased workload has led to a specific necessity for more parliamentary assistants. It should be noted that Parliament does have access to various other resources and supports, such as committee secretariats and political group staff, which also contribute to managing the responsibilities brought about by the treaty. However, it could be argued that further analysis and assessment regarding the potential need for increased staffing levels would be beneficial. This could involve an examination of the existing workloads of parliamentary assistants, as well as exploring alternative solutions that may address the administrative challenges arising from the Treaty of Lisbon, and thus ensuring the European Parliament functions effectively and efficiently.

In conclusion, while the Treaty of Lisbon has undeniably increased the administrative and workload demands on the European Parliament and its staff, it is not yet definitively established whether there is a specific need for a higher number of parliamentary assistants. Further evaluation and assessment of the existing resources and challenges implied by the treaty would provide a more informed basis for deciding on the necessity of such a measure.
