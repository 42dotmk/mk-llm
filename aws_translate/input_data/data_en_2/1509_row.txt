Step 1: Get a Haircut:
Starting with a haircut lays the foundation for your new look. Whether it's a trim or a bold new style, having a fresh cut ensures that your hair is healthy, even, and ready for the coloring process. It's important to consider your face shape, hair texture, and personal preferences when choosing a new haircut.

When selecting a hair dye, it's important to take your natural hair color into account. Many factors contribute to the final appearance of dyed hair, including undertones, highlights, and lowlights. By understanding your hair's natural characteristics, you'll be better equipped to choose a shade that complements your features and enhances your overall look.

Step 3: Choose a Color That Suits You:
Determining the right hair color also involves considering various personal factors like your skin tone, eye color, and personal style. To make an informed decision, research different color palettes and try experimenting with virtual hair dye apps which enable you to preview how various shades would look on you. If you're still unsure, consult a professional colorist who can help guide you in the right direction.

1. Hair dye of your chosen color
2. Gloves to protect your hands
3. A mixing bowl
4. A hair dye applicator brush
5. A hair clip or hair bands for sectioning off hair
6. A plastic cape or towel to protect your clothing and shoulders
