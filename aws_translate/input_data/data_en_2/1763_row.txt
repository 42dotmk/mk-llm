Question: It took Dad 5 more than twice as long to vacuum upstairs then to vacuum downstairs. He vacuumed for a total of 38 minutes. How many minutes did he vacuum upstairs?
Answer: Let D = time in minutes to vacuum downstairs. Upstairs = 2D + 5 minutes. 3D + 5 = 38. 3D = 33. D = 11 minutes. Upstairs = (2 * 11) + 5 = 27 minutes. Dad took 27 minutes to vacuum upstairs. The answer is 27.
[Question]Adam has just bought some new books so he has decided to clean up his bookcase. After he adds his new books to his bookshelf he realizes that he has bought enough books to finish completely filling his bookcase with 2 books left over. Before his shopping trip, Adam had 56 books in his bookcase. If his bookcase has 4 shelves and averages 20 books per shelf, how many books did Adam buy on his shopping trip?
[Answer]Adamâ€™s bookshelf has 4 shelves that fit 20 books each, which is 4 * 20 = 80 books in total to fill the bookshelf. Adam ended the day with a full bookcase of 80 books in the bookcase and 2 books left over, 80 + 2 = 82 books total. If Adam started the day with 56 books and ended the day with 82 books then Adam bought 82 - 56 = 26 books bought on his shopping trip. The answer is 26.

Question: The time Juan takes to grab his lunch from his office and back is half the time he takes to read a book. If he has a 4000-page book, how many pages does he read in an hour if he takes 4 hours to move from his office to grab lunch?
Answer: If Juan takes 4 hours to move from his office to grab lunch, moving from his office and back takes 2 * 4 = 8 hours. The time Juan takes to grab his lunch from his office and back is half the time he takes to read a book, meaning he reads a book in 8 * 2 = 16 hours. If he has a 4000 - page book, he will read 4000 / 16 = 250 pages in an hour. The answer is 250.
[Question]In a certain school, 2/3 of the male students like to play basketball, but only 1/5 of the female students like to play basketball. What percent of the population of the school do not like to play basketball if the ratio of the male to female students is 3:2 and there are 1000 students?
[Answer]The students are divided into 3 + 2 = 5 parts where 3 parts are for males and 2 parts are for females. Each part represents 1000 / 5 = 200 students. So, there are 3 x 200 = 600 males. And there are 2 x 200 = 400 females. Hence, 600 x 2 / 3 = 400 males play basketball. And 400 x 1 / 5 = 80 females play basketball. A total of 400 + 80 = 480 students play basketball. Therefore, 1000 - 480 = 520 do not like to play basketball. The percentage of the school that do not like to play basketball is 520 / 1000 * 100 = 52. The answer is 52.
