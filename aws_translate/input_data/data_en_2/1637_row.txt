 UPDATE: Warren was freed at 2:35 p.m. after posting a $100,000 bond. She's due in court June 14.

 Estella Warren is making one pretty jail bird right now. 
  
 The model and Planet of the Apes star landed herself in the slammer after allegedly smashing into three cars in Los Angeles on Monday. 
  
 The steering-challenged beauty drove away from the scene, was nailed by cops and ultimately arrested for DUI. And then it really got bad...

 Warren, who was driving her Toyota Prius when the incident happened, initially resisted arrest—in other words, kicked a cop—after police caught up with her, but she was eventually cuffed and hauled off to the station after failing a field-sobriety test (go figure) just past midnight. 
  
 But that wasn't the end of her adventure. 
  
 When Warren was being booked, she managed to slip her skinny model wrists out of her handcuffs and bolted for the back door of the station, where she tried to escape. 
  
 Which, as most people know, is kind of frowned upon by cops. 
  
 The Sports Illustrated swimsuit hottie was quickly caught (again) and was rewarded for her efforts by being booked on an additional charge of felony escape. Which brought her rap sheet total up to four for the night: she's also facing charges on assault, hit and run and, of course, DUI. 
  
 Incidentally, while Warren has publicly cited her age as 32, her booking report lists her as 40. Though in fairness, she can definitely pass for younger. 
  
 Her bail has been set at $100,000.

Besides being out of control and resistant to her arrest, Warren was also listed as 40 years old -- eight years older than she has claimed to be. 
  
 On Wikipedia, her birthday is listed as December 23, 1978, which makes her almost exactly my age. And yet, I know that isn't true from my only memories of her in movies and magazines. She was actually born in 1970, it seems. 
  
 She may have fooled directors and producers, but who could blame her? Life in Hollywood isn't easy for an older actress. But eight years is an awful lot to shave off. Here are some other actresses I suspect are doing more fibbing than truth telling when it comes to age:
