*no.

The two questions are not the same, as they pertain to different chemical compounds and are asking for different pieces of information.

The first question asks about the Lewis dot structure for glycerol. Glycerol, also known as glycerin, is a simple polyol compound with a chemical formula of C3H8O3. It has three carbon (C) atoms, eight hydrogen (H) atoms, and three oxygen (O) atoms. In order to determine the Lewis dot structure for glycerol, you would follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of valence electrons. Each carbon atom has 4 valence electrons, each hydrogen atom has 1 valence electron, and each oxygen atom has 6 valence electrons. Therefore, the total number of valence electrons for glycerol is (3x4) + (8x1) + (3x6) = 12 + 8 + 18 = 38 valence electrons.

2. Arrange the atoms to form a skeleton structure. Place the three carbon atoms in the center in a straight line, and connect them with single bonds. Attach the three oxygen atoms to the line of the carbon atoms, one oxygen for each carbon. Finally, add the hydrogen atoms around the carbon and oxygen atoms.

3. Distribute the valence electrons as both bonding electrons (shared in bonds) and non-bonding electrons (lone pairs). Following the octet rule, make sure that each atom has a stable electron configuration. Each carbon atom should have four bonds, each oxygen atom should have two bonds and two lone pairs, and each hydrogen atom should have one bond.

4. If needed, adjust multiple bonds to achieve full octets for the central atoms. In the case of glycerol, the octet rule is satisfied without the need for multiple bonds.

By following these procedures, you can draw the correct Lewis dot structure for glycerol.

The second question, on the other hand, asks for the Lewis dot structure of carbon disulfide (CS2). Carbon disulfide has a chemical formula of CS2, with one carbon (C) atom and two sulfur (S) atoms. To determine the Lewis dot structure for carbon disulfide, follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of valence electrons. The carbon atom has 4 valence electrons and each sulfur atom has 6 valence electrons. Thus, the total number of valence electrons for carbon disulfide is 4 + (2x6) = 4 + 12 = 16 valence electrons.

2. Arrange the atoms to form a skeleton structure. Place the carbon atom in the center and the two sulfur atoms on either side. Connect the carbon atom to each sulfur atom with single bonds.

3. Distribute the valence electrons as both bonding electrons and non-bonding electrons, following the octet rule. Each sulfur atom should have two bonds and two lone pairs, and the carbon atom should have four bonds.

4. Adjust multiple bonds, if necessary, to achieve full octets for the central atoms. In this case, changing the single bonds between carbon and sulfur atoms to double bonds will satisfy the octet rule for both carbon and sulfur atoms.

By following these steps, you can determine the Lewis dot structure for carbon disulfide. As you can see, the two questions ask about entirely different chemical compounds and require separate processes to find their respective Lewis dot structures. Therefore, the answer is *no, the questions are not the same.
