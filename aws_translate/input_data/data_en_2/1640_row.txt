Atletico Madrid secured their first win of the season by defeating newly-promoted Eibar 2-1 in their first La Liga home game at the Wanda Metropolitano Stadium. This victory comes on the heels of their opening match, which concluded in a goalless stalemate against Rayo Vallecano.

Despite the absence of head coach Diego Simeone from the touchline as he served his eight-match ban, the Rojiblancos managed to power through and claim their initial three points. Simeone, who was forced to watch from the stand, has been a key motivator for the team's recent resurgence and success.

Before the match commenced, Atletico Madrid was presented with the La Liga trophy, marking 105 days since their momentous victory that secured their first league title in 18 years. The clinching game was a gripping 1-1 draw against Barcelona at the iconic Nou Camp stadium.

With this crucial win, Atletico Madrid sets their sights on a successful title defense and mounting another challenge in the UEFA Champions League. As the season unfolds, it will be exciting to witness the potential evolution of this squad under the guidance of their inspirational coach, Diego Simeone, once his ban is lifted.
