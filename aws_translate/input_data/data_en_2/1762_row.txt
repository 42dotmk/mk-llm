The blocks that support rails for railway tracks are called sleepers or railroad ties. Sleepers are critical components of a railroad infrastructure, as they provide essential support and stability to the rails, ensuring the smooth and safe passage of trains.

Sleepers serve multiple purposes in the construction and maintenance of railway tracks. Some of their most important functions include:

1. Providing a stable and firm base for the rails: Sleepers evenly distribute the weight of trains across the track bed, ensuring stability and reducing the risk of rail deformation or buckling. By maintaining a consistent rail gauge – the distance between the inner sides of the two rails – sleepers help minimize derailments caused by misaligned tracks.

2. Anchoring the rails to the ground: With the use of fastening systems, such as clips, spikes or bolts, sleepers help secure rails in place and prevent them from shifting due to friction, vibration, thermal expansion, or contraction.

3. Absorbing vibrations: Sleepers, in combination with ballast – the crushed stones surrounding the sleepers – help dampen the vibrations and noise created by passing trains, thereby reducing wear and tear on the rails and protecting nearby structures, such as buildings and bridges.

4. Facilitating drainage: Sleepers work in conjunction with ballast to create a track structure that enables water to drain away from the rails. Proper drainage is crucial for preventing track damage caused by standing water and frost heave in freezing conditions.

Sleepers are typically made from a variety of materials, each with their own advantages and drawbacks:

1. Wooden sleepers – Made from hardwood, such as oak, these sleepers have been used for centuries and are known for their durability and ease of use. However, they can be susceptible to decay and damage from insects, and often require treatment with preservatives to ensure longevity.

2. Concrete sleepers – Introduced in the 20th century, concrete sleepers offer increased strength and durability over wooden alternatives. They also resist decay and insect damage and require less maintenance. However, they are heavier and more difficult to handle, often requiring special equipment for installation.

3. Steel sleepers – Steel sleepers are strong and durable, with excellent resistance to corrosion and decay. They are also lighter than concrete sleepers and can be more easily installed and replaced. However, they can be more expensive than other options and can be susceptible to heat-induced deformation.

4. Composite sleepers – Made from a combination of materials such as recycled plastics or rubber, composite sleepers are an environmentally friendly option. They offer excellent durability, resistance to decay, and vibration absorption, while being lightweight and easy to handle.

In conclusion, sleepers, or railroad ties, are crucial components of the railway infrastructure, ensuring the stability, safety, and longevity of the tracks. Available in a range of materials, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages, sleepers play an indispensable role in supporting rails and enabling the efficient operation of railway systems worldwide.
