[Question]At the new store, there are 3 times as many grape candies as cherry candies, and 2 times as many apple candies as grape candies. All the candies cost $2.50 each. If the total cost of the candies is $200, how many grape candies does the store have?
[Answer]Total number of candies is 200 / 2.5 = 80 candies. Let x be the number of cherry candies. There are 3 * x grape candies. There are 2 * 3 * x = 6 * x apple candies. x + 3 * x + 6 * x = 80. 10 * x = 80. x = 8. There are 8 * 3 = 24 grape candies. The answer is 24.
Q: Tina made a large pan of brownies and cut it into 24 pieces. She had one with lunch and dinner every day for 5 days. Her husband snagged one per day for 5 days to take to work. They shared 4 with dinner guests. How many brownies were left?
A: Tina ate one twice a day for 5 days so 2 * 5 = 10. Her husband at 1 per day for 5 days so 1 * 5 = 5. She made 24, ate 10, her husband ate 5 and the guests ate 4 so 24 - 10 - 5 - 4 = 5 brownies left. The answer is 5.
Question: Nina loves to travel. She tries to travel at least 400 kilometers in one month outside of her home country. Every second month she does twice that distance. If she were able to keep up with her resolution, how many kilometers would she travel during 2 years?
Answer: Every second month Nina does twice the regular distance, which means 400 * 2 = 800 kilometers. Two years is 24 months, so half of this time is 24 * 0.5 = 12 months. So in 12 months Nina does 400 * 12 = 4800 kilometers. And in the other 12 months, she does 800 * 12 = 9600 kilometers. So in two years, Nina would be able to make 4800 + 9600 = 14400 kilometers. The answer is 14400.
[Question]Grace is looking to plant some lettuce in her raised bed garden. Her raised bed is comprised of 2 large beds on top with 2 medium beds on the bottom. The top bed can hold 4 rows of lettuce with 25 seeds being sown per row. The medium bed can house 3 rows with 20 seeds being sown per row. How many seeds can Grace plant in all four beds of her raised bed garden?
[Answer]A large bed can hold 4 rows with 25 seeds per row, 4 * 25 = 100 seeds per large bed. 100 seeds per large bed and there are 2 beds, 100 * 2 = 200 seeds needed in total for both large beds. A medium bed can hold 3 rows with 20 seeds sown per row, 3 * 20 = 60 seeds per medium bed. 60 seeds per medium bed and there are 2 medium beds, 60 * 2 = 120 seeds needed in total for both medium beds. 200 seeds needed for the large beds combined with 120 seeds needed for the medium beds comes to 200 + 120 = 320 seeds needed to plant all four beds of the raised garden bed. The answer is 320.
