No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they focus on different subjects. The first question revolves around the "European Jewish" component of your sister's DNA results on AncestryDNA.com, while the second question inquires about the possibility of having zero Native American blood if your great grandfather was full Cherokee.

To address the first question, the "European Jewish" component found in your sister's DNA results on AncestryDNA.com refers to the genetic lineage tied to Jewish populations primarily from Central and Eastern Europe. These populations, known as Ashkenazi Jews, have a long history that spans over a thousand years. Their origin traces back to the ancient Israelites in the Levant (the geographical region that includes present-day Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan, and parts of Syria). The Jewish diaspora, a series of migrations and dispersals throughout various regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa, has led to different groups of Jewish populations forming distinct genetic markers.

The Ashkenazi Jewish population, in particular, experienced a significant growth in Central and Eastern Europe during the late Middle Ages. Over time, the Ashkenazim have developed unique genetic characteristics due to a combination of endogamy (marrying within their own communities), founder effects (a small number of initial settlers contributing to the gene pool), and population bottlenecks (a temporary reduction in population size, limiting genetic diversity). As a result, the "European Jewish" designation in your sister's DNA results points to her having a genetic connection, albeit potentially distant, to this specific Jewish population.

As for the second question, regarding the possibility of having zero Native American blood despite having a great-grandfather who was full Cherokee, the answer is not straightforward. DNA inheritance is complex due to the nature of the recombination process that occurs when genetic material is passed down from one generation to another. During the formation of an individual's chromosomes, a random reshuffling of genetic information happens, resulting in children receiving a combination of DNA from both of their parents in an unpredictable manner.

While it might seem surprising, it is possible for an individual to inherit little or no DNA from their great-grandparents. Generally, the further back in the family tree, the higher the chances of an ancestor's DNA "washing out" or becoming undetectable. In the case of your sister's AncestryDNA.com report showing zero Native American ancestry, it is plausible that due to the random and complex nature of DNA inheritance, she did not inherit a detectable amount of Cherokee DNA from her great-grandfather.

However, it is important to note that DNA tests offered by various companies have varying levels of accuracy and depend on the size and diversity of their reference populations. Different companies may yield slightly different results for the same individual. It might be helpful to test with another reputable company or confirm your family's historical records to have a more comprehensive understanding of your sister's ancestry.
