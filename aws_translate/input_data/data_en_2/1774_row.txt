Q: Sherman has a 30-minute commute to the office and a 30-minute commute home every day. On the weekends, he spends 2 hours, each day, driving his kids to their different activities. How many hours does Sherman drive a week?
A: He drives 30 minutes to work and 30 minutes home every day for a total of 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. He makes this drive 5 days a week for a total of 5 * 60 = 300 minutes. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour and he drives 300 minutes, 5 days a week so that's 300 / 60 = 5 hours. He drives 2 hours on both Saturday and Sunday so he drives 2 * 2 = 4 hours on the weekends. He commutes 5 hours during the week and spends 4 hours driving on the weekend for a total of 5 + 4 = 9 hours. The answer is 9.
Question: There are 11 boys and 13 girls in a class. If 1 boy is added to the class, what percentage of the class are girls?
Answer: There are a total of 11 + 1 = 12 boys in the class. Hence, there are a total of 12 boys + 13 girls = 25 students in a class. So 13 / 25 x 100% = 52% of the class are girls. The answer is 52.
[Question]Henry needs to declutter his book collection of 99 books. From his bookshelf, he was able to fill 3 boxes of 15 books each to take to a donation center. He had 21 books in a room he could donate, 4 on his coffee table and 18 cookbooks stashed in the kitchen. When he dropped them off, he noticed a box of books that had a "free to a good home" note. He grabbed 12 books to take back to his place. How many books does Henry now have?
[Answer]He filled 3 boxes with 15 books each so 3 * 15 = 45 books. From the rest of his house he is donating 45 + 21 + 4 + 18 = 88 books for donation. His collection is 99 books and he is donating 88 books, so that leaves him with 99 - 88 = 11 books. He picks up 12 books to add to his collection of 11 books so he now has 12 + 11 = 23 books. The answer is 23.
Q: Polly and Gerald went for a fun afternoon riding mini race cars at the munchkin track, which is a one-quarter mile circular track. Polly managed to circle the track 12 times in one half hour, but Gerald's car was malfunctioning, and he only moved at an average speed half of what Polly did. What speed did Gerald's car average, in miles per hour?
A: Polly circled the one - quarter mile track 12 times in 0.5 hours at a speed of 12 / 0.5 = 24 circuits of the track per hour. 24 / 4 = 6 miles per hour. Gerald traveled at a speed half of what Polly traveled for an average speed of 6 / 2 = 3 miles per hour. The answer is 3.
Question: On a mall-wide sale, Andre bought a $1350 treadmill for a 30% discount and 2 pieces of 45-pound plates for $50 each. How much did Andre pay for the treadmill and plates?
Answer: Andre had $1350 x 30 / 100 = $405 discount for the treadmill. So, a treadmill cost $1350 - $405 = $945. Two 45 - pound plates cost $50 x 2 = $100. So, Andre paid a total of $945 + $100 = $1045. The answer is 1045.
