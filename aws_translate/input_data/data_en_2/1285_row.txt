The Rolls-Royce engines used to power Concorde were the Olympus 593 Mk 610 turbojet engines. These engines were specifically developed for supersonic aviation, enabling Concorde to reach its top cruising speed of Mach 2.04 (around 1,354 mph or 2,180 km/h) and maintain it for extended periods.

The Olympus 593 Mk 610 engines were a collaboration between Rolls-Royce (UK) and Snecma (France), both of which were leading aerospace engine manufacturers. This joint development allowed the project to pool resources and expertise from the United Kingdom and France, as both countries were involved in the development and production of Concorde.

This engine design was based on the original Rolls-Royce Olympus engines that were initially developed in the 1950s for military aircraft such as the Avro Vulcan. Over the years, the Olympus engines went through multiple design stages and performance upgrades, culminating in the Olympus 593 optimized for supersonic passenger aircraft.

The Olympus 593 Mk 610 engines were unique and packed with advanced technologies in order to meet the challenging requirements of Concorde. Some of the key features of these engines included:

1. Power and efficiency: The Olympus 593 engines were extremely powerful, each producing 32,000 to 38,000 pounds of thrust. This massive power enabled Concorde to climb rapidly and reach high altitudes, where it could cruise at supersonic speeds, consuming less fuel in the thinner atmosphere.

2. Variable intake system: At supersonic speeds, the air entering the engine needs to be slowed down to subsonic speeds. The Olympus 593 engines featured a variable intake system that would adjust the intake geometry based on the speed of the aircraft. This ensured that the engines received the optimal airflow in both subsonic and supersonic flight conditions.

3. Afterburners: To achieve supersonic speeds, Concorde required additional thrust, which was provided by afterburners in the Olympus 593 engines. The afterburners would inject fuel into the exhaust stream, igniting it and providing a significant boost in thrust. Concorde mainly used the afterburners during takeoff and while transitioning to supersonic flight.

4. Noise reduction: The Olympus 593 engines were among the first commercial engines to incorporate noise reduction technologies. These included specific tailpipe designs and significantly lower thrust during landing to reduce the sonic boom and overall noise pollution near airports.

5. Advanced materials and construction: The Concorde's engines were subjected to extreme temperatures and stresses during supersonic flight. The Olympus 593 engines used advanced materials such as titanium and other high-temperature alloys to withstand these challenging conditions.

In summary, the Rolls-Royce Olympus 593 Mk 610 engines powered Concorde as it made history by providing supersonic transport to the general public, thus revolutionizing civil aviation. The engines' innovative technology and capabilities played a significant role in the aircraft's distinguished service and the public's perception of the Concorde as a symbol of technological advancement and luxury air travel.
