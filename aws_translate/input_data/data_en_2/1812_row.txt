Brian always drank from fresh coconuts unlike Matthew because, unlike his friend, Brian was fortunate to live in an exotic location where coconut trees were abundant and commonly found in his surroundings. This provided him with easy access to fresh coconuts which he enjoyed regularly. Matthew, on the other hand, lived in a suburb in the city where fresh coconuts were harder to come by, as they needed to be transported from other places, leading to a decrease in freshness and potentially higher prices due to transportation costs.

In addition to their differing living environments, Brian's exposure to the tropical climate and local culture shaped his preference for fresh coconuts as a natural and healthy source of hydration and nutrients. Not only were they a resource that could be readily harvested from his own backyard, but they also became a part of his daily routine, embodying the essence of living closer to nature. This lifestyle provided Brian with the opportunity to consume coconuts that had not gone through any packaging or processing, which meant that he was consuming them at their most natural and beneficial state.

Matthew, living in a city suburb, was more likely to experience limited access to fresh coconuts as well as a lack of familiarity with the practice of consuming them regularly. Supermarkets and grocery stores in urban areas might stock coconuts, but they are not always guaranteed to be fresh or equivalent to the quality of those from their natural source. Additionally, the culture and lifestyle in city suburbs do not usually encourage or emphasize the consumption of fresh coconuts as it does in tropical regions.

Furthermore, city dwellers like Matthew may have less awareness regarding the benefits of drinking directly from fresh coconuts, and might opt more readily for bottled coconut water or other packaged varieties that can easily be found on store shelves. This convenience, though it offers a level of accessibility, does not provide the same nutrient-rich experience as the fresh coconuts Brian was able to enjoy.

Furthermore, it should also be mentioned that Brian's preference for fresh coconuts stemmed not only from geographical factors but may also have been influenced by a personal inclination towards choosing healthier, more organic, and environmentally-friendly sources of nutrition and hydration. This preference would be further reinforced by his living conditions that provided ample opportunities to connect with nature and understand the value of wholesome food sources. Meanwhile, Matthew's city-based lifestyle may have contributed to his drinking choices being different from Brian's, due to the prominence and reliance on processed and packaged products.

In conclusion, Brian always drank from fresh coconuts unlike Matthew because of the differences in their living environments, cultural influences, accessibility to fresh coconuts, and personal preferences shaped by their surroundings. While Brian enjoyed the luxury of fresh coconuts right from the source, Matthew had to navigate an urban landscape where fresh coconuts were not as easily available, often resulting in alternative choices to find coconut-based hydration.
