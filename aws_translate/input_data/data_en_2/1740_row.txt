[Question]James decides to cut down some trees. In the first 2 days, he cuts down 20 trees each day. For the next 3 days his 2 brothers help him cut down trees. They cut 20% fewer trees per day than James. How many total trees were cut down?
[Answer]He cuts down 2 * 20 = 40 trees by himself. Each of his brothers cuts down 20 * .2 = 4 fewer trees per day. So they each cut down 20 - 4 = 16 trees. So for the next 3 days they cut down 20 + 16 * 2 = 52 trees per day. So they cut down 40 + 52 * 3 = 196 trees. The answer is 196.
Q: Sam earns $10 an hour on Math tutoring. For the first month, he earned $200; and for the second month, he earned $150 more than the first month. How many hours did he spend on tutoring for two months?
A: For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350. So, he earned a total of $200 + $350 = $550 for the first two months. Therefore, he spent $550 / $10 = 55 hours on math tutoring for the first two months. The answer is 55.
Question: Bobby has an aquarium with twice as many fish as Sarah's has. Sarah has 5 more fish in her aquarium than Tony does. Tony has 3 times as many fish in his aquarium as Billy does. Billy has 10 fish. How many fish do all 4 people have put together?
Answer: Since Tony has 3 times as many fish as Billy's 10, that means Tony has 3 * 10 = 30 fish. Sarah has 5 more fish than Tony's 30, meaning she has 5 + 30 = 35 fish. Bobby has twice as many fish as Sarah does, meaning he has 35 * 2 = 70 fish. Therefore, altogether there are 10 + 30 + 35 + 70 = 145 fish. The answer is 145.
[Question]Justin wanted to watch a movie that came on at 8 pm that night. His parents agreed as long as he finished his homework and chores before the movie started. He wouldn't be home until 5 pm because of baseball practice. He knew dinner would take 45 minutes, and he figured his homework would take 30 minutes to finish. He needed to clean his room, which would take 30 minutes; then take out the trash, which would take about 5 minutes; and empty the dishwasher, which would take another 10 minutes. What was the latest time that Justin could start his chores and homework to be done by 8 pm to watch his movie?
[Answer]Justin would spend 45 minutes at dinner, 30 minutes doing homework, 30 minutes cleaning his room, 5 minutes on the trash and 10 on dishes for a total of 45 + 30 + 30 + 5 + 10 = 120. Justin knows that 60min is the same as 1 hour. He has 120 minutes of work so 120 / 60 = 2 hours. His movie comes on at 8 pm and he has 2 hours of chores so 8 - 2 = 6 pm is the latest time he could start his chores. The answer is 6.
