Q: Jenna wants to buy a concert ticket that costs $181, plus five drink tickets for $7 each. If Jenna earns $18 an hour and works 30 hours a week, what percentage of her monthly salary will she spend on this outing?
A: First find the total cost of the drink tickets: 5 tickets * $7 / ticket = $35. Then add that cost to the cost of the ticket to find the total cost: $35 + $181 = $216. Then multiply Jenna's hourly rate by the number of hours she works each week to find her weekly earnings: $18 / hour * 30 hours / week = $540 / week. Then multiply her weekly earnings by the number of weeks she works each month: $540 / week * 4 weeks / month = $2160 / month. Then divide the cost of the concert by Jenna's monthly earnings and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: $216 / $2160 * 100% = 10%. The answer is 10.

[Question]Antoine is having a dinner party and his butcher recommends 1/2 pound of meat per person. If he's inviting 6 people over and the beef tenderloin is $15.00 a pound, how much will this cost him?
[Answer]He's inviting 6 people over and needs 1 / 2 pound of meat for each so that's 6 * .5 = 3 pounds of meat. The beef tenderloin is $15.00 a pound and he needs 3 pounds so that's 15 * 3 = $45.00 for dinner. The answer is 45.
Q: A special school for deaf and blind students has a deaf student population three times the size of blind student population. If the number of deaf students is 180, how many students are there altogether?
A: Call the number of blind students b. There are 180 deaf students, which is three times the number of blind students, so 3b = 180. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 1 / 3 gives b = (1 / 3) * 180 = 60. The total number of students is 180 + 60 = 240. The answer is 240.
Question: 4 students participated in a 200m race. If the average completion time of the last three students was 35 seconds, and the average completion time of all four runners was 30 seconds, how long (in seconds) did it take the student who came first to finish the race?
Answer: The last 3 students had an average completion time of 35 seconds so the sum of their completion times was 3 * 35 = 105 seconds. All 4 students (now including the student who came first) had an average completion time of 30 seconds, meaning the sum of their completion times is 4 * 30 = 120 seconds. The student who came first spent 120 - 105 = 15 seconds in the race. The answer is 15.
