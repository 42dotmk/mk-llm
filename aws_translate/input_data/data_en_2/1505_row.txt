[Question]Matt has six cats and half of them are female. If each female cat has 7 kittens, and Matt sells 9 of them, what percentage of his remaining cats are kittens (rounded to the nearest percent)?
[Answer]First find the number of cats that are females: 6 cats / 2 = 3 cats. Then find the total number of kittens born: 7 kittens / cat * 3 cats = 21 kittens. Then subtract the 9 kittens that were sold: 21 kittens - 9 kittens = 12 kittens. Then add the number of kittens to the number of adult cats to find the total number of cats: 12 kittens + 6 cats = 18 cats. Then divide the number of kittens by the total number of cats and multiply by 100% to find the percentage of cats that are kittens: 12 kittens / 18 cats * 100% = 66.666...%, which rounds up to 67%. The answer is 67.
Q: A coach placed 15 tennis balls and 5 soccer balls each into 5 baskets. He gave 5 of his students a short period of time to remove as many balls each from a basket as they could. 3 of them removed 8 balls each and the other 2 removed a certain number of balls each. If a total of 56 balls are still in the baskets, how many balls did the other 2 students each remove?
A: Combining the tennis and soccer balls, there are 15 + 5 = 20 balls in each basket. There are 5 baskets, hence 5 * 20 = 100 balls in total. 3 students removed 8 balls each, they removed 3 * 8 = 24 balls. From the total number of balls, they left 100 - 24 = 76 balls. There are 56 balls left so the other 2 students must have removed a total of 76 - 56 = 20 balls. This means that each of these 2 students removed 20 / 2 = 10 balls. The answer is 10.
Question: Josh has a device that automatically records the temperature in his lab every 5 seconds. To perform an analysis of environmental conditions, Josh lets the device record data for one hour. How many instances of data will the device record?
Answer: There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. The device records data every 5 seconds so there will be 3600 / 5 = 720 instances of data in an hour. The answer is 720.
[Question]Eliana walked 200 steps for her morning exercise, did some press-ups, then added some 300 more steps to her count for the first day. The next day, she walked twice the number of steps she walked on the first day. And on the third day, Eliana walked an additional 100 steps. What's the total number of steps Eliana walked during these three days?
[Answer]On the first day, she walks 200 + 300 = 500 steps. The next day she walks twice the steps, which is 2 * 500 = 1000. The total number of steps after the two days are 1000 + 500 = 1500. On the third day, she walks an additional 100 steps, bringing the three - day total to 1500 + 100 = 1600 steps. The answer is 1600.
