Q: Liezl prepared four sets of 2-dozen paper cups for her daughter's birthday party. If 5 cups were damaged and 30 were not used, how many paper cups were used?
A: Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 then 2 dozens of cups is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cups. So, Liezl prepared a total of 24 cups x 4 sets = 96 paper cups. A total of 5 + 30 = 35 paper cups were not used. Hence, 96 - 35 = 61 paper cups were used. The answer is 61.
Question: A cattle breeder owns 52 dairy cows. Each cow gives 1000 oz of milk per day. Calculate the amount of milk produced per week by the cows.
Answer: Per day, the amount of milk produced is 1000 * 52 = 52000 oz. Per week, the amount of milk produced is 52000 * 7 = 364000 oz. The answer is 364000.
[Question]Each frog needs to eat 30 flies per day to live. Each fish needs to eat 8 frogs per day to live. Each gharial needs to eat 15 fish a day to live. How many flies get eaten every day in this swamp if it has 9 gharials?
[Answer]First find the number of fish the gharials need to eat: 9 gharials * 15 fish / gharial = 135 fish. Then find the number of frogs by multiplying that quantity by the number of frogs per fish: 135 fish * 8 frogs / fish = 1080 frogs. Then multiply the number of frogs by the number of flies each frog eats to find the number of flies: 1080 frogs * 30 flies / frog = 32,400. The answer is 32400.
Q: Haylee has 3 dozen guppies in her aquarium. Jose has half as many guppies as Haylee in his tank. Charliz has one-third of what Jose has in his tank. Nicolai has 4 times as many guppies as Charliz in his pond. How many guppies do the four friends have altogether?
A: Haylee has 3 x 12 = 36 guppies. Jose has 36 / 2 = 18 guppies. Charliz has 18 / 3 = 6 guppies. Nicolai has 6 x 4 = 24 guppies. Altogether, the four friends have 36 + 18 + 6 + 24 = 84 guppies. The answer is 84.
Question: Hasan is packing up his apartment because he’s moving across the country for a new job. He needs to ship several boxes to his new home. The movers have asked that Hasan avoid putting more than a certain weight in pounds in any cardboard box. The moving company has helpfully provided Hasan with a digital scale that will alert him if a package is too heavy. Hasan is in the kitchen, and he fills a cardboard box with 38 dinner plates. When he checks the box, the scale reports his box is too heavy. Hasan knows each of his plates weighs 10 ounces. He removes a single plate from the box and checks the movers’ scale again. The scale reports his box is still too heavy. Hasan repeats the process again and again. When he has removed enough plates, the movers’ scale shows the box is now an acceptable weight for shipping. Hasan deduces that each shipping box can hold 20 pounds before the scale says the box is too heavy. How many plates did Hasan need to remove from the shipping box?
