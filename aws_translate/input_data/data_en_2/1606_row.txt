Considering the context provided, it is likely that Carson would want to put the newly acquired knowledge and skills from Sydney into practice by attempting to bake a cake on their own. Carson's next steps may involve the following:

1. Gathering necessary ingredients: To bake a cake, Carson would need to gather the essential ingredients such as flour, sugar, baking powder, eggs, milk, butter, salt, and any desired flavorings (like vanilla or cocoa) or additives (like chocolate chips or nuts) to create the specific type of cake they want to make.

2. Procuring suitable equipment and tools: For baking a cake, Carson would require appropriate utensils, baking equipment, and tools such as mixing bowls, measuring cups and spoons, a whisk or electric mixer, a spatula, a sifter, parchment paper, a cake pan, and, of course, an oven.

3. Preheating the oven: Carson must preheat the oven to the required temperature, depending on the cake recipe they choose to follow. Most cakes are baked at a temperature between 325-375°F (165-190°C).

4. Preparing the cake batter: Carson would need to follow the instructions provided in the cake recipe or the steps taught by Sydney to create the cake batter. This process generally involves creaming together the butter and sugar, adding eggs one at a time, and gently incorporating the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, and salt) and the wet ingredients (milk and flavorings).

5. Pouring the batter into the cake pan: Once the cake batter is smooth and well-mixed, Carson should pour it into a greased and/or parchment-lined cake pan to ensure easy removal after baking.

6. Baking the cake: Carson should place the cake pan in the preheated oven and bake the cake for the suggested time mentioned in the recipe, usually anywhere between 20-45 minutes, depending on the type and size of the cake. They must also ensure not to open the oven door until the cake is close to being done, as this could cause the cake to deflate.

7. Checking for doneness: Carson can determine whether their cake is fully baked by inserting a toothpick or a knife into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean or with just a few crumbs, the cake is ready. If it comes out wet or with uncooked batter, Carson should bake the cake for an additional few minutes and check again.

8. Cooling the cake: Once the cake is baked, Carson should remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes in the pan before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. This step is essential to avoid the cake from falling apart when slicing or decorating.

9. Decorating the cake: If Carson wants to, they can now decorate the cake with frosting, icing, or any other toppings. They could explore various decorating techniques and creative ideas to make their cake visually appealing.

In summary, Carson would most likely want to apply their newfound knowledge of baking a cake by gathering suitable ingredients and equipment, following a recipe, preparing, and baking the cake, and possibly even decorating it as desired. This endeavor would allow Carson to test their skills, gain more experience, and enjoy the satisfaction of creating a delicious homemade cake.
