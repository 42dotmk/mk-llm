The soothsayer said Emily had more fantastical dreams than Cynthia because Emily had a more vivid imagination. This doesn't undermine Cynthia's imaginative prowess at all, but it was merely the level of vividness in their imaginative capacity that set them apart, especially in creating fantasy. This difference was quite trackable in the way their dreams materialized and how they recounted each episode.

Imagination, as it pertains to Emily and Cynthia, needs to be understood as a spectrum rather than an absolute capability. Each individual dream they chalked down on the canvas of their subconscious was a direct reflection of their imagination at that time. Like two artists with different styles, the differences between Emily and Cynthia's dreams were not indicative of a greater or lesser ability, simply a different methodology.

Emily's dreams were sculpted with a vibrant shade of inventive brilliance, encapsulating eccentricities, and intricate details that seemed plucked from the pure ether of fantasy. Her dreams weren't just stories; they were rich narratives brimming with a multitude of diverse characters, otherworldly landscapes, and unpredictable events. These details sprouted from a vivid imagination that worked overtime, weaving an elaborate tapestry of different elements, all contributing to the conception of a spectacularly fantastical world within her mind.

Her dreams were like grand epics, fantasy fiction novels that wove an intricate tale of mysterious creatures and mythical landscapes. The soothsayer took note of the astounding detail, the remarkable coherence, and the gripping suspense that characterized Emily's dreams.

This isn't to say that Cynthia lacked an imaginative spirit. Cynthia, too, had a remarkable capability to dream up scenarios and weave stories from her subconscious. Her dreams, however, ran on a different wavelength. They were more rooted and grounded in reality, with an artistic interpretation of the metaphorical aspect of existence.

Cynthia's dreams had a kind of mystical realism. They were nuanced versions of reality with surreal tinges, emphasizing more on emotional depth, metaphorical interpretations, and psychological elements. Cynthia's imagination was more oriented toward introspective thought and abstract concepts. 

To sum it up, Emily and Cynthia were two sides of the same coin. Emily adorned the side of vibrant extensive imagination that crafted vast, grand, and detailed fantasies, while Cynthia represented the other side, with grounded, in-depth, and introspective dreams highlighting elements of life and the self's abstract aspects. It was this difference between Emily's vibrantly vivid fantasies and Cynthia's more grounded imaginative dreams that led the soothsayer to make his observation.

The amalgamation of Emily's unconventional plots with those of Cynthia's introspective themes creates a comprehensive representation of the wonders of human imagination. This combination serves as a reminder that creativity and imagination know no boundaries; whether fantastical or introspective, each dream carries its unique beauty, starring as a testament to the boundless potentials of the human mind.
