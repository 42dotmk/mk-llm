Boiling potatoes is a simple and versatile cooking method that can be accomplished by following these detailed steps:

1. Choose the right potatoes: Select potatoes that are firm, with no green spots, sprouts, or blemishes. The most common types of potatoes suitable for boiling are Russet, Yukon Gold, and red potatoes. Each type offers different textures and flavors:

   - Russet potatoes are starchy and ideal for mashing or making potato salad.
   - Yukon Gold potatoes have a buttery texture, making them suitable for boiling and mashing.
   - Red potatoes are waxy and hold their shape well, making them perfect for boiling and serving in salads or side dishes.

2. Clean the potatoes: Rinse the potatoes thoroughly under cold running water to remove any dirt and debris from the skin. Use a vegetable brush to gently scrub the surface if necessary. 

3. Peel or leave the skin on: Depending on your preference, you can either peel the potatoes with a vegetable peeler or leave the skin on. If leaving the skin on, just double-check to ensure that they are clean.

4. Cut the potatoes (optional): If you want to cook your potatoes quickly or plan to use them in a salad, you can cut them into quarters or smaller, even-sized pieces to ensure uniform cooking. If you prefer whole boiled potatoes, make sure they are of similar size for even cooking.

5. Fill a large pot with water: Use a large pot with enough cold water to cover the potatoes by at least 1 inch (2.5 cm). 

6. Salt the water (optional): Add a generous pinch of salt to the water for seasoning. This step is optional, but it can enhance the flavor of the potatoes.

7. Add the potatoes to the pot: Carefully place the potatoes or potato pieces into the pot of cold water. Starting with cold water allows for even cooking from the inside out.

8. Bring to a boil: Turn the burner up to high heat, and bring the water to a rolling boil. Keep an eye on the pot as it reaches boiling, as it may bubble up and possibly overflow.

9. Lower heat and simmer: Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to medium or medium-low, ensuring that it maintains a steady simmer. Cover the pot with a lid to help maintain the temperature and accelerate cooking.

10. Check for doneness: Boil the potatoes until they are fork-tender. Cooking times will vary depending on the type and size of the potatoes. As a general guide:
   
   - Small, whole new potatoes or fingerlings usually take 12-15 minutes.
   - Quartered or diced Yukon Gold, red, or other waxy potatoes may take around 15-20 minutes.
   - Large, whole Russet or baking potatoes might take 20-25 minutes or more.

11. Drain the water: Once the potatoes are tender, carefully remove the pot from heat and pour the contents through a colander to drain the water.

12. Let the potatoes cool (if required): If you are planning to use the boiled potatoes in a salad or prefer them to be served cold, let them cool down for about 15-20 minutes before using. Otherwise, they can be served hot as a side dish or mashed with butter and milk for a delicious mashed potato dish.
