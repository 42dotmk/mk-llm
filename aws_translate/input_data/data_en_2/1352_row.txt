In order to help you decide whether to prefer IT over CSE at BIT Mesra, or if you should choose Thapar for CSE or BIT Mesra for IT, we first need to understand the key differences between IT and CSE, as well as the differences between the two institutes. Based on these factors, I will provide a reasoning and recommendation for both situations and then determine if the questions are the same. 

Step 1: Understand IT vs CSE
Information Technology (IT) focuses on the practical application, management, and maintenance of computer systems and networks. On the other hand, Computer Science Engineering (CSE) involves a broader study of algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and computer hardware.

Step 2: Analyze the reputation of BIT Mesra and Thapar University
BIT Mesra is well-known for its Engineering and Technology disciplines and has strong industry connections. Thapar University is also considered one of the top private engineering institutions in India with a reputation for its Computer Science program. We need to consider factors like campus life, faculty, placements, and alumni network.

Step 3: Compare CSE in Thapar vs IT in BIT Mesra
CSE at Thapar University would provide a strong foundation in computer science and engineering, while IT at BIT Mesra would allow you to build practical skills specifically for managing and supporting information systems. If your primary interest is in computer programming, software development, and theoretical knowledge, CSE at Thapar may be the better option. If you are more focused on the practical application, network, and systems management, then IT at BIT Mesra could be a better choice.

Step 4: Evaluate preferences and career goals
It's essential to consider your preferences and long-term career goals. If you want a more research-oriented path or work as a software engineer, CSE could be preferable. However, if you aim to work in roles like IT manager, network architect, or systems analyst, IT would be better suited.

Now, considering the steps listed above, we can address the questions you asked.

Question 1: Should one prefer IT instead of CSE at BIT Mesra?
Answer: It depends on your interests, preferences, and career goals. If you are more inclined towards practical applications, network, and systems management, then you may prefer IT. However, if you want a broader understanding of computer science, algorithms, and programming languages, you might choose CSE.

Question 2: What should I choose, Thapar for CSE or BIT Mesra for IT and why?
Answer: If you are passionate about computer programming, software development, and want a strong foundation in computer science, opt for CSE at Thapar. If you want to focus on practical applications and managing information systems, choose IT at BIT Mesra.

Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? 

Answer: [-] no

While both questions revolve around decision-making between IT and CSE, the questions are not the same. The first asks whether IT should be preferred over CSE at BIT Mesra, while the second is a comparison between Thapar's CSE and BIT Mesra's IT in terms of personal interests and preferences.
