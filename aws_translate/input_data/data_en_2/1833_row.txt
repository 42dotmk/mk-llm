his expertise lay primarily in the domain of mechanical engineering. As a renowned mechanical engineer, he had spent a significant portion of his life studying, designing, and constructing various types of engines – from internal combustion engines found in cars, to steam engines and turbines that powered massive industrial machines and generators. His deep understanding of the mechanical principles, thermodynamics, and fluid dynamics involved in the function of engines had made him an authority in the field.

However, this same man found himself unable to write instructions for building houses because his knowledge and experience did not extend to civil engineering and architecture. While mechanical engineering primarily focuses on the design, development, and analysis of mechanisms and machines, civil engineering concerns the planning, design, construction, and maintenance of various infrastructures such as roads, bridges, buildings, and other physical facilities. 

Building a house involves understanding materials and their varying properties, like wood, steel, concrete, and bricks, as well as accounting for factors like the structural stability of the building, environmental stresses, and local building codes and regulations. Furthermore, architectural design principles such as aesthetics, functionality, and spatial optimization need to be considered in order to create a comfortable and efficient living space. Such considerations are quite distant from the man's area of expertise, which lies primarily in the mechanical realm.

Though engineering, in general, focuses on problem-solving and design, there are distinct differences between the various disciplines. In mechanical engineering, the man would rely on Newton's laws of motion, equations relating to heat transfer and fluid dynamics, and principles of materials science to optimize the performance of engines. In contrast, with civil engineering and architecture, the knowledge required extends to concepts such as soil mechanics, structural analysis, and urban planning – all of which are critical factors in designing and constructing houses.

The man could certainly attempt to learn civil engineering and architectural principles, but this would likely take a significant amount of time, involving additional education, research, and hands-on experience. Moreover, writing instructions for building houses would require not only an understanding of these principles but also a familiarity with the specific types of materials and techniques utilized in a given region, to account for differences in climate, culture, and aesthetics.

In conclusion, the man could write comprehensive instructions for building engines, drawing from his considerable knowledge and experience in mechanical engineering. But when it comes to constructing houses, his lack of knowledge and experience in the fields of civil engineering and architecture hinder his ability to generate detailed guidance on the subject. Such a task would require an expanded understanding of the relevant principles and context, proper interdisciplinary collaboration, or even a significant investment of time and effort in acquiring new knowledge and skills.
