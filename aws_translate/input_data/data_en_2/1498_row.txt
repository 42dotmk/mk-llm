The last step of the process after successfully sending the rocket carrying the satellite into space would be to establish communication with the satellite, monitor its performance, and perform any necessary adjustments to ensure its successful operation in orbit.

1. Establish communication with the satellite: Once the satellite reaches its designated orbit, the ground control team needs to establish communication with it. This is done through a network of ground stations that transmit and receive signals from the satellite. The communication link enables the team to assess the satellite's health, transmit commands, and receive data from its instruments and payload.

2. Monitor the satellite's performance: After establishing communication, the ground control team continuously monitors the satellite's performance parameters, such as its power levels, temperature, and positioning. This helps to ensure that the satellite operates optimally in the harsh environment of space and can carry out its intended purpose effectively.

3. Perform orbit adjustments if necessary: The satellite's initial orbit may not be perfect, requiring the team to make minor adjustments to fine-tune its position. This could involve using the satellite's onboard propulsion system to change its altitude or inclination, ensuring that it remains in the desired orbit for the duration of its mission.

4. Calibrate instruments and payload: After positioning the satellite in the right orbit, the team calibrates its onboard instruments and payload to ensure their accuracy and reliability. This may involve adjusting the sensitivity of scientific instruments or updating software to process the data collected by these instruments.

5. Conduct routine maintenance and updates: Throughout its lifetime, the satellite requires ongoing maintenance, both in terms of hardware and software. This includes monitoring any signs of degradation, updating software, and planning for contingencies, such as potential collisions with space debris or other satellites in orbit.

6. Analyze and utilize the data collected: As the satellite carries out its intended purpose, it generates data that needs to be collected, analyzed, and used by various stakeholders. For example, a weather satellite might provide crucial information to meteorologists, while a communications satellite might enable telecommunication and internet service providers to offer services to their customers.

7. Deorbit and decommission the satellite: Eventually, the satellite will reach the end of its operational life. At this point, it must be either deorbited, where it re-enters Earth's atmosphere and burns up, or maneuvered into a graveyard orbit, where it will no longer pose a risk to other operational satellites. Once this has been accomplished, the satellite is considered decommissioned, and the mission is complete.

In conclusion, the final step in the process of launching and operating a satellite is to ensure its successful operation by establishing communication, monitoring its performance, performing necessary adjustments, analyzing the collected data, and eventually decommissioning it when its mission is complete.
