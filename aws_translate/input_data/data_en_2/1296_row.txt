[Question]Cary is an engineer in charge of designing an irrigation system for three farmers. Farmer Bob grows 3 acres of corn, 9 acres of cotton, and 12 acres of beans. Farmer Brenda grows 6 acres of corn, 7 acres of cotton, and 14 acres of beans. Farmer Bernie grows 2 acres of corn and 12 acres of cotton. If corn takes 20 gallons of water an acre, cotton takes 80 gallons of water an acre, and beans take twice as much water as corn, what percentage of the total water used will go to Farmer Bob's farm?
[Answer]First figure out how much water beans take by multiplying the water use for corn by 2: 20 gallons / acre * 2 = 40 gallons / acre. Next, calculate Bob's water use by multiplying each plant's water use per acre by the number of acres he planted, then adding up the total water use for all three crops: 3 * 20 + 9 * 80 + 12 * 40 = 1260. Now do the same thing for Brenda: 6 * 20 + 7 * 80 + 14 * 40 = 1240. And do the same thing for Bernie: 2 * 20 + 12 * 80 = 1000. Now add up each farmer's water use to find the total water use: 1260 + 1240 + 1000 = 3500. Now divide Bob's water use by the total water use and multiply by 100 to find what percentage of the water he used: 1260 / 3500 * 100 = 36%. The answer is 36.
Q: Olga has an aquarium with fish in 5 different colors. There are 12 yellow ones, half as many blue ones, and twice as many green ones as yellow ones. How many fish does Olga have in her aquarium?
A: Olga has half as many blue fish as yellow ones, which means 12 * 0.5 = 6 blue fish. Green fish are twice as many as yellow ones, so in total there are 12 * 2 = 24 green fish. So all the fish sum up to 12 + 6 + 24 = 42. The answer is 42.
Question: We the People has 17 cows. Happy Good Healthy Family has two more than three times the number of cows We the People has. If their cows are taken to a ranch to graze together, how many cows will be in the ranch altogether?
Answer: Three times the number of cows We the People has is 3 * 17 = 51 cows. Happy Good Healthy Family has two more than three times the number of cows We the People has, a total of 51 + 2 = 53 cows. If the cows are taken to a ranch to graze together, their total will be 53 + 17 = 70 cows. The answer is 70.
[Question]Mr. Martinez is two feet taller than his daughter, Chiquita. If Chiquita is 5 feet tall, calculate their combined height.

Q: A trader made a profit of $960 after a week of sales. To raise $610 to pay for her next shipment of wares, she splits the profit in half and solicits donations from her family and friends. If she received a total donation of $310 and adds it to one-half of her profit, how much money did she make above her goal?
A: She splits her $960 profit in half to get $960 / 2 = $480. She receives a total donation of $310, so she now has $310 + $480 = $790. She needed only $610 so she has $790 - $610 = $180 more than she needs. The answer is 180.
