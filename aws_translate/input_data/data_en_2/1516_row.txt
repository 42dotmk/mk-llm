The series, which was produced with 20th Century Fox Television for CBS, follows a team of doctors and support staff stationed at the "4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital" in Uijeongbu, South Korea, during the Korean War (1950 -- 53). The show's title sequence features an instrumental-only version of "Suicide Is Painless", the original film's theme song.
