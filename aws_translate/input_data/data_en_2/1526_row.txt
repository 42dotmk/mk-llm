[Question]Tara is saving up to buy a new clarinet. She already has $10 saved. The clarinet costs $90. She plans to sell her old books to make the money. She sells each book of hers for $5. However, when she is halfway towards her goal, she loses all her savings and has to start over. How many books does she sell in total by the time she reaches her goal?
[Answer]Halfway towards her goal is $45 because 90 / 2 = 45. She sells $35 worth of books before she loses the money because 45 - 10 = 35. She sells 7 books before losing her money because 35 / 7 = 5. She then sells 18 books because 90 / 5 = 18. She sells 25 books in total because 18 + 7 = 25. The answer is 25.

[Question]Two vampires have come to the sleepy village of Willowton, population 300. Every night, each vampire turns 5 more people into vampires. How many vampires are there after two nights?
[Answer]First find the number of new vampires after one night: 5 people / vampire * 2 vampires = 10 people. Add that to the starting number of vampires to find the total number of vampires after one night: 10 vampires + 2 vampires = 12 vampires. Then find the number of new vampires on the second night: 5 people / vampire * 12 vampires = 60 people. Add that number to the starting number of vampires on the second night to find the total number of vampires after two nights: 60 vampires + 12 vampires = 72 vampires. The answer is 72.
Q: A salesman bought a case of 48 backpacks for $576. He sold 17 of them for $18 at the swap meet, 10 were sold to a department store for $25 each. If the remainder were sold for $22 each. How much was the salesman's profit?
A: The salesman sold 17 bags for 17 bags x $18 / bag = $306. He sold 10 more for 10 bags x $25 / bag = $250. Thus far he has sold 17 bags + 10 bags = 27 bags. Therefore he sold 48 bags - 27 bags = 21 bags for $22 each. 21 bags were sold for 21 bags x $22 / bag = $462. In total the salesman made $306 + $250 + $462 = $1018. The salesman made $1018 - $576 = $442 in profit. The answer is 442.
