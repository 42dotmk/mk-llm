The guide, entitled "How to Act in Extreme Situations or Instances of War," was compiled in reaction to Russia's aggressive behaviour towards neighbouring states. Over the past few years, the Russian Federation has engaged in acts of aggression towards its neighbors, particularly those in the Baltic region, causing an increased sense of alarm among these smaller nations.

Lithuania, along with its Baltic neighbors Latvia and Estonia, has experienced numerous incidents of Russian incursion into their airspace and maritime territory, as well as cyberattacks on their critical infrastructure. These countries, being members of both the European Union and NATO, are particularly vulnerable to Russia's ambitions to reassert its dominance in the region and disrupt the balance of power.

The 98-page guide, published by the Lithuanian government, addresses various aspects of potential invasion and subsequent occupation geared towards ensuring the safety and preparedness of its citizens. Some of the key recommendations contained within this document reflect both practical actions and psychological resilience strategies.

Keeping calm: One of the fundamental messages within the guide is the importance of remaining calm under pressure, as panic and disorganization can potentially lead to disastrous consequences in a crisis situation.

Using Facebook to organize resistance: In the event of an invasion, communication infrastructure may be compromised, rendering traditional methods of communication unreliable. The guide advises citizens to use social media platforms like Facebook to organize and coordinate resistance activities, share vital information with one another, and maintain connections with the rest of the world.

Doing your job worse than before: As a potential last resort, the guide suggests that Lithuanian citizens could adopt a subtle form of resistance against an occupying force by deliberately performing their everyday tasks less efficiently than usual. This passive-aggressive strategy could potentially slow down or disrupt the operations of the occupying forces without necessarily inviting harsh reprisals.

The publication of this survival guide underscores the degree to which Russia's actions, including the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its ongoing involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, have raised concerns among its Baltic neighbors regarding their own security. By preparing their citizens for the possibility of an invasion, the Lithuanian government is taking a proactive stance, reinforcing the importance of individual and collective responsibility in the face of a potential threat.

In conclusion, Lithuania's decision to release a comprehensive guide on how to survive an invasion reflects the heightened sense of insecurity generated by Russia's aggressive behaviour towards its neighbouring states. The guide provides practical advice and psychological strategies that not only empower Lithuanian citizens with the knowledge and skills necessary to protect themselves against potential threats but also serves as a deterrent to any potential aggressors by showcasing a nation prepared to stand united for its sovereignty and freedom.
