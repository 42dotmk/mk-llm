(b). Rachel spoke the language there.

While it was a serendipitous adventure for Rachel and Sarah, not knowing Czech proved to be a significant barrier for Sarah. Rachel, on the other hand, excelled at understanding and speaking the language, thanks to her semester in Prague during college.

Upon arriving, Rachel took the lead, navigating the picturesque city streets with ease while Sarah struggled to decipher street signs and menus. As the days progressed, Sarah began feeling more like a burden than an exploratory companion.

Step 1: Begin with their arrival in Prague, enhance the character's experiences.
As their flight touched down in Prague, the excitement of exploring a new city was palpable for both Sarah and Rachel. While Rachel effortlessly conversed with locals, collected information about the best places to visit, and navigated public transportation, Sarah tried her best to participate but found herself feeling isolated and out of her element.

Step 2: Incorporate an event that highlights the language barrier for Sarah.
One evening, the girls decided to attend a traditional Czech marionette show. As Rachel enthusiastically chatted with the elderly puppeteer, Sarah found herself unable to participate in the conversation, silently watching in envy as her friend's eyes lit up in a moment of cultural exchange. This growing sense of isolation only heightened Sarah's frustration with the language barrier.

Step 3: Explore the realization of the impact of the language barrier on their friendship and trip.
As the trip progressed, it became evident that the barrier wasn't just linguistic - it was also driving a wedge between the friends. Rachel found herself having to mediate every interaction Sarah experienced, and the once-independent woman was forced to rely heavily on her friend. This dynamic made both of them uncomfortable, and the tension was palpable.

Step 4: Introduce a turning point that initiates change and growth for the characters.
One day, while sitting in a cozy cafe, a kind-hearted local woman heard Sarah's frustration and offered a helpful suggestion. She introduced Sarah to a language app that would help her learn to speak and understand Czech at a beginner's level. Sarah decided to give it a try, and over the next few days, began making efforts to communicate in the local language.

Step 5: Show the growth and improvement in the friendship and overall trip experience.
As Sarah's language skills improved, even if only slightly, the mood of the trip changed for the better. She felt empowered, as she was now able to engage in simple interactions and understand what was happening around her. Rachel was relieved to see her friend regaining her independence, and their camaraderie strengthened. Both friends began fully enjoying the beauty and intrigue of Prague, from the majestic castle and Charles Bridge to the quaint, cobblestone alleys of the Old Town.

In the end, the trip to Prague started as a frustrating experience for Sarah but ultimately led to personal growth and a deepened friendship with Rachel, who was able to guide her through the language barrier and see her true spirit shine through adversity.
