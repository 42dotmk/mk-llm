Question: Erik's dog can run 24 miles per hour. It is chasing a rabbit that can run 15 miles per hour. The rabbit has a head start of .6 miles. How many minutes does it take for the dog to catch up to the rabbit?
Answer: The dog runs .4 miles per minute because 24 / 60 = .4. The rabbit runs .25 miles per minute because 15 / 60 = .25. We know that .4(Number of Minutes) = .25(Number of Minutes) + .6. Therefore .15(Number of Minutes) = .6. Therefore (Number of Minutes) = 4. The answer is 4.
[Question]Julie wants to give her favorite cousin a $2345 mountain bike for his birthday. So far, she has saved $1500. Since the birthday is still a few weeks away, Julie has time to save even more. She plans on mowing 20 lawns, delivering 600 newspapers, and walking 24 of her neighbors’ dogs. She is paid $20 for each lawn, 40 cents per newspaper, and $15 per dog. After purchasing the bike, how much money will Julie have left?
[Answer]Mowing lawns will earn Julie 20 * 20 = 400 dollars. Her earnings, in dollars, from delivering newspapers will be 600 * 40 / 100 = 240 dollars. After walking 24 of her neighbor’s dogs, she will earn 24 * 15 = 360 dollars. She will therefore earn a total of 400 + 240 + 360 = 1000 dollars. Combining earnings from her job with her savings will give Julie 1000 + 1500 = 2500 dollars. Subtracting the cost of the mountain bike from the total will leave Julie with a balance of 2500 - 2345 = 155 dollars. The answer is 155.
Q: Joe goes camping with his dad on a Friday. Joe's dad has 21 marshmallows, and Joe has four times as much marshmallows as his dad. If Joe’s dad roasts a third of his marshmallows, and Joe roasts half of his marshmallows, how many marshmallows did they roast in total?
A: Joe’s dad roasts 21 / 3 = 7 of his marshmallows. Joe has 21 * 4 = 84 marshmallows. Joe roasts 84 / 2 = 42 of his marshmallows. Joe and his dad roasted 7 + 42 = 49 marshmallows in total. The answer is 49.
Question: The ratio of boys to girls in a classroom is 3:5. If there are 4 more girls than boys, how many students are in the classroom?
Answer: Since the ratio of boys to girls is 3:5, then the class is divided into 3 + 5 = 8 parts. The girls have 5 - 3 = 2 parts more than the boys. Since 2 parts are equal to 4, then 1 part is equal to 4 / 2 = 2 students. Hence, there are 8 parts x 2 = 16 students. The answer is 16.
[Question]Gretchen read that you should spend 10 minutes walking for every 90 minutes you spend sitting. If Gretchen spends 6 hours working at her desk, how long will she spend walking?
[Answer]First find the total number of minutes Gretchen spends sitting at her desk: 6 hours * 60 minutes / hour = 360 minutes. Then divide this amount by 90 minutes to find how many walking breaks Gretchen takes: 360 minutes / 90 minutes / break = 4 breaks. Then multiply the number of breaks by the length of each break to find how long Gretchen spends walking: 4 breaks * 10 minutes / break = 40 minutes. The answer is 40.
