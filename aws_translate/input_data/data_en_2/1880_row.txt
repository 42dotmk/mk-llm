Q: While at Wizards Park, Kate buys 3 magic wands, one for herself and two for her friends. When she returns she sells the wands to her friends for $5 more than she paid. If she collected $130 after the sale, how much money did each wand cost?
A: Out of 3 wands purchased, Kate sold her friends 3 wands - 1 wand = 2 wands. For 2 wands she charged $130, so for 1 wand she charged $130 / 2 wands = $65 / wand. Since she charged $5 more for each wand than she paid, Kate paid $65 - $5 = $60 for each wand. The answer is 60.

[Question]Tony has a terrible toothache and decides to buy some painkillers from the store. He picks up a bottle of 50 pills and takes them home. He takes 2 pills each day three times a day for the first 2 days, before cutting this amount in half for the next 3 days. On the sixth day, he takes a final 2 pills in the morning and ends up feeling better. How many pills are left in the bottle?
[Answer]Tony starts with 50 pills and takes 2 pills each 3 times a day, meaning he takes 2 * 3 = 6 pills in total. Tony repeats this process for two days in total, meaning over those two days he takes 2 * 6 = 12 pills. Tony then cuts down his pill usage in half, meaning he's now taking 6 / 2 = 3 pills a day. Since he repeats this process for three days, that means he takes 3 * 3 = 9 pills for that period. Adding in the two pills Tony took on the final day, that means he took 12 + 9 + 2 = 23 pills. Since there were 50 pills in the bottle to begin with, this means Tony has 50 - 23 = 27 pills remaining. The answer is 27.
Q: Clyde and Grace are building block towers. Grace’s tower is 8 times the size of Clyde’s at 40 inches tall. How many inches taller is Grace’s tower than Clyde’s?
A: Clyde’s tower is 1 / 8 the size of Grace’s tower or 40 inches / 8 = 5 inches tall. Grace’s tower is 40 inches – 5 inches = 35 inches taller than Clyde’s. The answer is 35.
Question: An animal shelter recently took in twelve cats. The shelter already had half that number of cats. Two days later, three had been adopted. The next day, one of the cats had five kittens, and one person arrived to pick up one of the cats that was their missing pet. How many cats does the shelter have now?
Answer: The shelter started with 12 / 2 = 6 cats. The cats they took in increased the number to 12 + 6 = 18 cats. Three cats were adopted, so they had 18 - 3 = 15 cats. One cat had 5 kittens, which increased the number of cats to 15 + 5 = 20 cats. The pet owner came to get his missing cat, so they now have 20 - 1 = 19 cats. The answer is 19.
