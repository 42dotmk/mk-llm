No, it would not be accurate to infer that a ship management team is an optional requirement. The reason for this lies in the multi-faceted and critical responsibilities carried out by a ship management team. In fact, a ship management team is an essential component of owning and operating a ship engaged in the business of importing and exporting goods. The responsibilities of the ship management team are crucial to the safe, efficient, and compliant running of the vessel; hence it is not just an optional requirement.

Here are some of the main responsibilities of a ship management team that highlight their indispensability:

1. Technical Management: A ship management team is responsible for the technical aspects of the ship's operation. This includes maintaining the ship's machinery and equipment, carrying out necessary repairs, and making sure the vessel adheres to the international and local safety regulations.

2. Crew Management: The ship management team is responsible for employing the crew, ensuring their proper training and certification, managing work schedules, and handling payroll, benefits, and disciplinary actions. Crew welfare and compliance with international maritime labour laws are also critical tasks performed by the ship management team.

3. Safety Management: A ship management team is crucial for ensuring the safety of both the crew and the ship itself. This includes implementing safety measures, providing training to the crew, compliance with international maritime safety standards, and implementing risk management strategies. The management team also needs to run regular safety drills and maintain emergency response plans.

4. Financial Management: A ship management team is responsible for budget management, analyzing the cost of operations, and monitoring voyages' profitability. The team must ensure that the finances of a ship are well-organized and that there are no unnecessary expenses.

5. Regulatory Compliance: A ship management team ensures that the vessel complies with maritime laws and regulations. This includes obtaining and maintaining relevant certifications and documents, interacting with authorities during inspections, and adhering to environmental regulations.

6. Navigational Management: A ship management team is responsible for planning the ship's navigation, ensuring the vessel is on the appropriate route, and following the instructions of the ship's captain. It also involves the constant monitoring of weather conditions and utilizing the latest navigational technologies.

7. Chartering and Commercial Management: A ship management team is responsible for negotiating contracts and agreements with charterers, cargo owners, or shipping brokers. This includes pricing strategy, fixing charters, and maximizing the profitability of voyages.

To sum up, a ship management team is an integral part of a vessel's operations, responsible for several critical aspects necessary for the safe, efficient, and compliant running of a ship. Therefore, it cannot be considered an optional requirement. Instead, it is an essential component of owning and operating a ship involved in importing and exporting goods.
