Q: Three frogs are trying to hop across the road. The first frog takes 4 times as many hops as the second. The second frog takes twice as many as the third. If the three frogs took a total of 99 hops, how many hops did it take the second frog to cross the road?
A: Let x represent the number of hops it took the third frog. The second frog:2x. First frog:4(2x) = 8x. Total:x + 2x + 8x = 99. 11x = 99. x = 9. Second frog:2(9) = 18 hops. The answer is 18.
Question: Tomorrow, Pete must finish paying off the last $90 he owes on a bike. He goes through his wallet and finds two $20 bills. Checking his pockets, he finds four $10 bills. Unhappy that he doesn't have the entire amount, he suddenly remembers that he has plastic bottles that can be returned to his local store for cash. If the store pays 50 cents for each bottle, how many bottles will Pete have to return to the store?
Answer: Pete’s wallet contains 2 * 20 = 40 dollars. The money in Pete’s pockets is 4 * 10 = 40 dollars. In total Pete has 40 + 40 = 80 dollars. He owes 90 dollars on the bike and therefore needs 90 - 80 = 10 more dollars. Since 50 cents is ½ dollar, then the number of bottles required to get 10 dollars is 10 / (1 / 2) = 10 * 2 = 20 bottles. The answer is 20.
[Question]Matt's protein powder is 80% protein. He weighs 80 kg and wants to eat 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight each day. How much protein powder does he need to eat per week?
[Answer]He wants to eat 80 * 2 = 160 grams of protein a day. That means he needs 160 / .8 = 200 grams of protein per day. So he needs 200 * 7 = 1400 grams per week. The answer is 1400.
Q: A baker is comparing the day’s sales to his daily average. He usually sells 20 pastries and 10 loaves of bread. Today, he sells 14 pastries and 25 loaves of bread. If pastries are sold for $2 and loaves of bread are sold for $4, what is the difference, in dollars, between the baker’s daily average and total for today?
A: The daily average sales of pastries amounts to 20 pastries * $2 / pastry = $40. The daily average sales of bread amounts to 10 loaves of bread * $4 / loaf = $40. Therefore, the daily average is $40 + $40 = $80. Today’s sales of pastries amounts to 14 pastries * $2 / pastry = $28. Today’s sales of loaves of bread amounts to 25 loaves of bread * $4 / loaf = $100. Therefore, today’s sales amount to $28 + $100 = $128. This means the total difference between today’s sales and the daily average is $128 – $80 = $48. The answer is 48.
