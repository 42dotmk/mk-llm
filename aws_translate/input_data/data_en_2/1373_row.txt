While the statement provided captures a part of Superman's comic book history, there are various important events and story arcs that have occurred to Superman over the decades. Here is a more detailed answer:

Superman first appeared in Action Comics #1 in 1938, created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. The character quickly became an icon and an essential part of DC Comics' line-up, spawning a plethora of stories and iterations leading to his current version.

The statement you provided mentions the Silver Age Superman, a version that existed mainly from the mid-1950s to the mid-1980s. During this time, Superman underwent numerous adventures with a campier and more science-fiction-focused tone. "Crisis on Infinite Earths" (1985-1986) was a DC Comics crossover event that aimed to make the DC universe more cohesive and less convoluted by eliminating multiple parallel worlds and alternate versions of characters. As a result, elements of Superman's Silver Age history were rewritten or erased.

The story you mentioned, "Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?" by Alan Moore, was indeed an "imaginary tale" or an "Elseworlds" story, which served as a tribute to Silver Age Superman's long history. It was published in 1986 as a two-part send-off for this version of the character before a major reboot that would redefine Superman for a new era.

The reboot involved writer and artist John Byrne, who was tasked with reimagining the character following the reboot. His series, titled "The Man of Steel" (1986), modernized Superman's origin, powers, and mythos for contemporary audiences. In this new version, Superman's powers were somewhat reduced compared to the Silver Age, making him less god-like and more relatable to readers. The series also offered an updated take on his relationships with supporting characters like Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, Ma and Pa Kent, and others.

Since then, Superman has undergone several other significant changes and events in the comics, such as:

1. "The Death of Superman" (1992): Superman died fighting the monster Doomsday in a highly publicized storyline that captured mainstream media attention. He would later be resurrected, of course.
2. "Superman: Red Son" (2003): An Elseworlds tale that imagines Superman's origin in the Soviet Union rather than the USA.
3. "Infinite Crisis" (2005-2006): Another major crossover event that once again redefined the DC universe and revised some aspects of Superman's history.
4. The New 52 (2011): DC Comics rebooted its entire line, including Superman's, with a modern and more streamlined continuity.
5. DC Rebirth (2016): A relaunch of the DC comic book line which sought to restore classic elements of the characters, including Superman's, bringing about a more hopeful and inspiring version of the hero.

In summary, various changes and events have happened to Superman in comics throughout the years. While the statement you provided is accurate for a specific moment in Superman's history, it does not encompass the entire scope of his evolution. The character has undergone multiple reboots, reimaginings, and significant storylines that have transformed his narrative over time.
