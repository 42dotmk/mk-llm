jar, brushing off the bits of grass that clung to its surface. Just moments earlier, she had so confidently handed it to Satina, speaking softly about its power, about its ability to trace Vane. And now, as Satina stared at the word so carelessly etched onto the side of the vessel, she could feel her heart pounding against her ribcage, struggling to escape the confines of her body.

Death.

The word seemed to echo around the small clearing, mixing with the howling wind that blew through the low branches of the surrounding trees. It was a warning, a cautionary label that underscored the threat this jar posed – not only to Vane but potentially to them all. Satina wondered if Hadja had fully understood the consequences of what she had done, of what she had so thoughtlessly brought into their midst.

"What have you done, Hadja?" Satina whispered heatedly, her voice quivering with a mixture of fear and rage. "Why would you bring this? Do you even know what it means?"

Hadja looked up from the jar, her eyes wide with surprise. Clearly, she hadn't expected Satina to react in such a way. "I – I didn't mean any harm," she stammered, clutching the clay vessel to her chest. "I thought it might help us find Vane."

"You thought wrong," Satina hissed, tearing her eyes from the chilling word on the jar's side and fixing Hadja with a venomous glare. "This... this thing," she said, waving a trembling hand at the jar, "it's dangerous."

Hadja glanced down at the jar, frowning in confusion. "But how can it be? It's just a simple tracing spell, Satina," she insisted, her voice small and wavering, as though even she was not entirely convinced by her own words. "I swear, I never meant for anything bad to happen."

Satina could see the genuine fear in Hadja's eyes, the pained desperation with which she clung to the belief that she had made a grave mistake. But even so, her anger could not entirely be assuaged. "We can't use this, Hadja," she said firmly, her voice suddenly hard and unyielding. "Whatever spell this jar contains, it's not worth the risk."

Hadja looked as though she might argue, but ultimately, she nodded her head, the motion slow and heavy with defeat. "Very well," she murmured, carefully setting the jar back down in the grass. "I'm... I'm sorry, Satina."

Satina watched her go, her body still trembling with the force of her emotions. As the other woman disappeared back into the treeline, Satina glanced once more at the jar, her gaze lingering on the word that had sent chills racing down her spine.

Death.

Instinctively, she wrapped her arms around herself, as if that might somehow protect her from the unknown dangers that now seemed to surround them. For the first time, Satina found herself questioning the lengths to which she and her friends were willing to go in their desperation to find Vane – and, more importantly, she began to wonder whether some lines were better left uncrossed.

Unbeknownst to her, as Satina turned away from the jar and followed Hadja into the shadows of the forest, a thin, black tendril of smoke slowly began to rise from the vessel's firmly sealed lid, twisting and snaking its way into the darkness of the night sky.
