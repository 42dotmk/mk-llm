Q: Maria wants to paint a picture and needs some tools to do that. She wants to buy a set of brushes for $20 and some canvas for three times more than the brushes. The paint costs Maria $8 per liter, and she needs at least 5 liters. How much money will she earn on the painting if she will be able to sell it for $200?
A: Maria wants to pay 3 * 20 = $60 for the canvas. Maria needs 5 liters of paint, so the cost of it would be 8 * 5 = $40. So in total Maria will earn 200 - 40 - 60 - 20 = $80 if she will be able to sell the painting at the mentioned price. The answer is 80.
Question: Tara has been planning to buy a laptop which costs $1000. A computer shop accepts payment in installments of $65 per month provided that a 20% down payment is made. If Tara wants to pay an additional $20 for the down payment, how much will her balance be after paying for 4 months?
Answer: Tara has to make a $1000 x 20 / 100 = $200 down payment. Since Tara wants to pay $20 more for the down payment, her total down payment will be $200 + $20 = $220. So her remaining balance payable over a year is $1000 - $220 = $780. Tara has to make a monthly payment of $780 / year / 12 months / year = $65 / month. The total cost of her payments for 4 months is $65 / month x 4 months = $260. Therefore, Tara's balance after 4 months is $780 - $260 = $520. The answer is 520.
[Question]At a garage sale, Tish bought 4 items: a red horseshoe magnet, two stuffed animals, and a large sticker which read, "Why can't teachers solve their own math problems?" The magnet cost three times more than the sticker, but only one quarter the price of the two stuffed animals combined. If the Magnet cost $3, how much, in dollars, did a single stuffed animal cost?
[Answer]If the magnet cost 3 - times more than the sticker, the sticker cost 3 / 1 = 1 dollar. If the magnet cost 1 / 4 the price of the two stuffed animals combined, then two stuffed animals cost 3 * 4 = 12 dollars. Thus, a single stuffed animal cost 12 / 2 = 6 dollars. The answer is 6.
Q: Dale owns 4 sports cars. The red one can travel at twice the speed of the green one, but the green one can travel at 8 times the speed of the blue one. The yellow one is broken and cannot move at all. If the blue one can travel at a speed of 80 miles per hour, at what speed, in miles per hour, can the red car travel?
A: If the blue car can travel at 80 mph, then the green one can travel at 8 * 80 = 640 mph. If the green car can travel at 640 mph, then the red can travel at 2 * 640 = 1280 mph. The answer is 1280.
