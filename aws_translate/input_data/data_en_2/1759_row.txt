The translation to English highlights the importance of prudential supervision for the proper functioning of a management company.

Prudential supervision typically involves the oversight of financial institutions and organizations by national or international authorities. The main objective of this type of supervision is to maintain the integrity and stability of the financial system, as well as protecting investors, consumers, and the overall economy.

In the context of a management company, prudential supervision encompasses a variety of duties and responsibilities. This can include monitoring the financial position, risk management processes, corporate governance, and business operations of the company. It also involves ensuring that the organization complies with all relevant regulatory requirements, laws, and standards.

The role of prudential supervision in a management company is crucial because it helps to minimize risks and ensure the long-term viability and performance of the firm. A well-regulated financial system promotes investor confidence, fosters economic growth, and reduces the likelihood of financial crises and collapses.

Some key aspects of prudential supervision in a management company include:

1. Capital adequacy: Ensuring that the management company maintains sufficient capital to absorb potential losses and continue its operations in the event of adverse market conditions or financial stress.

2. Risk management: Assessing and monitoring the company's risk profile, as well as ensuring that appropriate risk mitigation strategies, policies, and procedures are in place to manage and control risks effectively.

3. Corporate governance: Ensuring that the company adheres to strong corporate governance practices, including transparency, accountability, effective risk management, and a robust internal control system.

4. Compliance: Monitoring the company's compliance with regulatory requirements, reporting obligations, and standards of ethical conduct.

5. Financial reporting and disclosure: Ensuring that the organization provides accurate and timely financial information to regulators, investors, and other stakeholders to enable informed decision-making.

6. Prudential reporting and regulatory communication: Ensuring that the company maintains open lines of communication with regulatory authorities to facilitate ongoing monitoring and supervision, and to promptly address any concerns or issues that may arise.

The reference to "section 2" in the translated phrase may suggest that this prudential supervision responsibility or guideline is part of a broader document, agreement, or regulatory framework. It is crucial for stakeholders, regulators, and management companies to understand and adhere to these prudential supervision requirements to maintain a safe and financially sound environment for all parties involved.
