Canada and the United States have a long history of collaboration dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries. However, the relationship only became a formal alliance following World War II. To fully understand when Canada and the US became allies, it is essential to consider significant events in their shared history and various milestones that have solidified their diplomatic relations.

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the relationship between Canada and the US was tumultuous marked by conflicts such as the War of 1812. Following the end of this war, the Treaty of Ghent was signed in 1814, which laid the foundation for improved relations between the two nations.

After the war, Canada and the US developed mutual interests in terms of trade, commerce, and peaceful coexistence. The Oregon Treaty of 1846, the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842, and other subsequent agreements helped facilitate this process.

Nevertheless, the two countries did not become formal allies until World War II, a period that significantly transformed their relationship. World War II marked the beginning of a more explicit strategic alliance. While Canada and the United States fought together against the Axis powers, it was not until the end of the war that their partnership was formalized.

The true origins of their alliance can be traced back to the signing of the Charter of the United Nations in 1945, making both Canada and the United States founding members. Having collaborated in various international initiatives in the years that followed, they further solidified their alliance in 1949 with the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a military alliance intended to counterbalance the power of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.

Another pivotal moment in their relationship came in 1957 through the signing of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) agreement, a joint defense pact between Canada and the United States, aimed at defending North American airspace. This pact demonstrated their commitment to working together in matters of military importance and continental defense.

The collaboration between Canada and the US has only grown stronger in subsequent decades, and their relationship now encompasses political, economic, military, social, and cultural cooperation. This partnership is also reinforced by the vast number of agreements and institutions they share â€“ including trade agreements like the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement (1988) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA, now USMCA) implemented in 1994.

In summary, while the roots of cooperation between Canada and the United States can be traced back to the early 19th century, they did not become formal allies until the post-World War II era with the signing of the United Nations Charter in 1945. The relationship was further cemented with their joint membership in NATO in 1949 and the establishment of NORAD in 1957. Today, the Canada-US alliance is a strong and multifaceted partnership encompassing various aspects of international affairs, from defense and trade to cultural exchanges and environmental cooperation.
