Title: Rising Tensions Within Syria's Army Amid Government Crackdown On Protesters

The National Security Council has recently condemned the brutal violence perpetuated by the Syrian government against their own citizens during protests, according to NPR reports. Labeling it as "completely deplorable and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms," their official statement reflected international outrage over the government's use of force to suppress its people's demands for democratic rights.

In response to the ongoing violence, the United States is reportedly exploring various policy options, which may include targeted sanctions against Syria's government. Additionally, American officials have expressed support for the protesters and highlighted that their demands for freedom of expression, association, and the right to assemble peacefully, as well as the freedom to choose their own leaders, should not be ignored.

As the crackdown on protesters continues across Syria, there is a growing sense of unrest within the country's armed forces. Soldiers are becoming increasingly opposed to employing violence against demonstrators, with reports emerging of some soldiers in the city of Daraa refusing to open fire on their fellow citizens. This is not the first instance of military dissent, and there have been several cases of military officials being assassinated for reportedly siding with the protesters.

According to Nicholas Blanford of the Christian Science Monitor, the deepening division within the Syrian army could "cast serious doubt" on the government's ability to withstand the ongoing crisis and maintain control over its populace. The consequences of such discord among the armed forces are far-reaching, as it could potentially lead to a state of internal conflict that would only exacerbate the country's current instability.

The widening gap between the government and its people, as well as the rising tensions within key institutions such as the army, are indicative of the growing pressure on the Syrian authorities to address the issues raised by the protesters. As the international community continues to condemn the government's violent reaction to peaceful protests and demand accountability for its actions, there is an increasing chance that more severe consequences may be levied against Syria's leadership.

It remains to be seen whether targeted sanctions or other policy options will be effective in compelling the Syrian government to halt its crackdown on protesters and respond constructively to their demands. However, the growing signs of dissent within the military could be instrumental in hastening this process, as a divided army is unlikely to be able to support the government indefinitely.

In conclusion, the escalating violence in Syria is indicative of a deepening crisis, and the authorities must move to address the concerns of their citizens and respect their right to peacefully demand democratic change. The increasing rift within the armed forces, combined with international condemnation and pressure for action, could well bring the government to a tipping point, ultimately resulting in a more significant shift in policy or power.
