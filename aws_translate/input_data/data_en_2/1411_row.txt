It takes her six drops of glue to stick down each clipping. Lena has already glued her seven closest friends’ pictures. How many drops of glue will she need for the newspaper clippings for her collage?
A: Lena has 3 clippings per friend, so she has 3 * 7 = 21 clippings to glue. She needs 6 drops of glue per clipping, so she will need 6 * 21 = 126 drops of glue. The answer is 126.
Question: Anderson makes mud masks for spa treatments. In every batch of mud that he mixes, he adds three sprigs of mint, and he adds two green tea leaves for every sprig of mint. He had to switch to a different kind of mud, which makes the other ingredients he adds half as effective. How many green tea leaves should Anderson add to a new batch of mud to get the same efficacy as before?
Answer: Anderson adds 3 * 2 = 6 green tea leaves in every batch of mud. They are half as effective in the new mud, so Anderson should ad 6 * 2 = 12 green tea leaves to get the same efficacy as before. The answer is 12.

Q: In the final game of the basketball season, four players scored points. Chandra scored twice as many points as did Akiko. Akiko scored 4 more points than did Michiko, and Michiko scored half as many points as did Bailey. If Bailey scored 14 points, how many points in total did the team score in the final game of the season?
A: If Bailey scored 14 points, and Michiko scored half as many points as Bailey, then Michiko scored 14 / 2 = 7 points. If Akiko scored 4 more points than did Michiko, then Akiko scored 7 + 4 = 11 points. Since Chandra scored twice as many points as did Akiko, then Chandra scored 11 * 2 = 22 points. Thus, in total, the team scored 14 + 7 + 11 + 22 = 54 points in total during the final game of the season. The answer is 54.
Question: Wendy's truck has a gas tank that can hold 20 gallons. She also has a car with a gas tank that holds 12 gallons. The truck's tank is half full. The car's tank is 1/3 full. If she fills them both up completely, how many gallons does she add?
Answer: The truck tank has 10 gallons in it because 20 x .5 = 10. The car tank has 4 gallons in it because 12 x (1 / 3) = 4. She needs to add 10 gallons to the truck because 20 - 10 = 10. She needs to add 8 gallons to the car because 12 - 4 = 8. She needs to add 18 gallons in total because 10 + 8 = 18. The answer is 18.
