Before the season of sacrifice, various pre-Lenten celebrations and traditions take place in different regions and cultures all around the world. Primarily observed in countries with strong Christian influences, these celebrations serve as an opportunity for people to engage in festivities and enjoy the pleasures of life before the rigorous fasting and penitential observances of the Lenten season.

In areas with a large Roman Catholic presence, the pre-Lenten season is marked by Carnival, which involves elaborate costume parades, music, dancing, and indulgence in food and drink. The Carnival season traditionally begins on the Feast of the Epiphany (January 6), and culminates with the Mardi Gras (Shrove Tuesday or Fat Tuesday), the day before the first day of Lent (Ash Wednesday). 

However, in countries such as the Philippines, which is predominantly Roman Catholic, Carnival is no longer celebrated after the dissolution of the Manila Carnival in 1939. Instead, Filipinos observe their own unique way to prepare for the Lenten season, called "Pabasa" or "Pasyon", which is a recitation of the narrative of Christ's life, passion, and death.

In historically Lutheran countries like Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, the pre-Lenten celebration is known as Fastelavn. Traditionally held on the Sunday or Monday seven weeks before Easter, Fastelavn typically involves children dressing up in costumes, exchanging colorful cards known as "fastelavnskort," and participating in fun activities, such as hitting a barrel filled with sweets and goodies (similar to a piñata) until it breaks open.

In areas with a high concentration of Anglicans and Methodists, pre-Lenten festivities occur on Shrove Tuesday, which involves indulging in rich, fatty foods like pancakes before the fasting of Lent begins. It is often associated with penitential observances and reflection, preparing oneself spiritually for the coming season of sacrifice.

In Eastern Orthodox nations, such as Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, the pre-Lenten season is called Maslenitsa or "Butter Week." Celebrated during the week before Great Lent, Maslenitsa involves colorful festivities, folk music, games, and the consumption of traditional pancakes called "blini," which symbolize the sun. As a fusion of pagan and Christian traditions, this celebration serves as a precursor to the stricter fasting period and religious observances that follow during Great Lent.

In German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands, the Carnival season typically opens on November 11 (often at 11:11 a.m.)—a date that dates back to celebrations held before the Advent season or harvest celebrations of St. Martin's Day. These festivities, also known as Fasching or Fastnacht, are marked by parades, costume parties, and other merrymaking activities before the somber tone of the Lenten season sets in.

In conclusion, the time before the season of sacrifice is marked by various celebrations that differ according to cultural and religious backgrounds. These festivities allow people to engage in fun, merrymaking, and often indulgence before they embark on the solemn, reflective, and penitential observances of the Lenten period.
