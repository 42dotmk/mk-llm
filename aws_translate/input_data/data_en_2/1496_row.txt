Reasoning and answer: The total number of shirts in the donation box is 4. The total number of pants in the donation box is 4 x 2 = 8. The total number of shorts in the donation box is 8 / 2 = 4. The total number of clothes donated is 4 + 8 + 4 = 16 pieces.
The answer: 16

Wearing the high - tech shoes, Candace can hike 6 mph * 2 = 12 mph for the first two hours. Then she gets one blister, so her speed drops to 12 mph - 2 mph = 10 mph for the next two hours of the hike. After that time Candace gets another blister, but 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours, so the hike is over and we don't care about her speed anymore. Candace spends an equal amount of time walking at 12 mph and 10 mph, so we can average the two speeds to find an overall speed of (12 mph + 10 mph) / 2 = 11 mph.
The answer: 11
Reverse engineering the question: Candace is trying to decide whether to wear her old shoes or new high-tech shoes for a hike. The high-tech shoes will help Candace walk twice as fast, but they're not broken in yet, so she'll get 1 blister after every 2 hours she spends walking in them. Each blister slows Candance down by 2 miles per hour. If Candance walks 6 miles per hour in the old shoes and plans to hike for 4 hours, how many miles per hour can she go in the new shoes?

Reasoning and answer: They will earn 15 x $2 = $30 for the candied apples. They will earn 12 x $1.5 = $18 for the candied grapes. Therefore, Cindy and Olaf will earn $30 + $18 = $48 if they sell everything.
The answer: 48

Reasoning and answer: They are to order a total of 3 burger meals and 3 sodas for Paulo and Jeremy. The cost of a soda is $6 / 3 = $2. So, the 3 sodas will amount to $2 / soda x 3 sodas = $6. The 3 burger meals will amount to $6 / burger x 3 burgers = $18. Hence, the total cost for their orders is $6 + $18 = $24.
The answer: 24
