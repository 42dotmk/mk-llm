[Question]Tom's rabbit can run at 25 miles per hour. His cat can run 20 miles per hour. The cat gets a 15-minute head start. In hours, how long will it take for the rabbit to catch up?
[Answer]The cat got a 15 / 60 = .25 hour head start. That means it ran 20 * .25 = 5 miles. The rabbit goes 25 - 20 = 5 mph faster than the cat. So it takes 5 / 5 = 1 hour for the rabbit to catch up. The answer is 1.
Q: The student council sells scented erasers in the morning before school starts to help raise money for school dances. The local bookstore donated 48 boxes of erasers. There are 24 erasers in each box. If the student council sells the erasers for $0.75 each, how much money will they make?
A: There are 48 boxes x 24 erasers = 1,152 erasers. The student council will make 1,152 erasers x $0.75 = $864. The answer is 864.
Question: In a car racing competition, Skye drove a 6-kilometer track. For the first 3 kilometers, his speed was 150 kilometers per hour. For the next 2 kilometers, his speed was 50 kilometers per hour more. For the remaining 1 kilometer, his speed was twice as fast as his speed on the first 3 kilometers. What is Skye's average speed for the entire race?
Answer: Since time is obtained by dividing distance and speed, then Skye took 3 km / 150 km per hr. = 1 / 50 of an hour to finish the first 3 kilometers of the race. His speed on the next 2 kilometers was 150 + 50 = 200 kilometers per hour. Hence, it took him 2 km / 200 km per hr. = 1 / 100 of an hour to finish the next 2 kilometers. His speed on the remaining 1 kilometer is 150 x 2 = 300 kilometers per hour. Hence, it took him 1 / 300 of an hour to finish the 1 kilometer. So, the total time it took for Skye to complete the race was 1 / 50 + 1 / 100 + 1 / 300 = 1 / 30 of an hour. Therefore, his average speed for the entire race was 6 km / 1 / 30 hour = 180 kilometers per hour. The answer is 180.
[Question]With 40 seconds left to play in the basketball game, the Dunkinville Hornets were leading the Fredingo Fireflies by a score of 86 to 74. In the remaining seconds in the game, the Fireflies scored 7 three-point baskets while holding the Hornets to only 2 two-point baskets to win the game. How many more points did the Fireflies score in the game than did the Hornets?
[Answer]In the final 40 seconds, the Fireflies scored seven 3 - point baskets to improve their score by 3 * 7 = 21 points. Thus, the Fireflies final total was 74 + 21 = 95 points. In the final 40 seconds, the hornets scored an additional two 2 - point baskets to improve their score by 2 * 2 = 4 points. Thus, the Hornets final total was 86 + 4 = 90 points. The final difference in points between the two teams was 95 - 90 = 5 points. The answer is 5.
