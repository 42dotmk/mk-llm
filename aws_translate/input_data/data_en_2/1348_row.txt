[Question]An aquarium holds an equal number of clownfish and blowfish. 26 of the blowfish stay in their own tank, and the remaining blowfish swim into a display tank. An equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank, but then a third of these clownfish swim back into their own tank. If the aquarium holds a combined total of 100 fish, how many clownfish are now in the display tank?
[Answer]There is an equal number of clownfish and blowfish, which means there are 100 fish / 2 = 50 blowfish. Since some stay in their tanks, there are 50 blowfish – 26 blowfish = 24 blowfish in the display tank. There were the same amount of clownfish until 24 clownfish / 3 = 8 clownfish swam back to their own tank. This leaves 24 clownfish – 8 clownfish = 16 clownfish in the display tank. The answer is 16.
Q: In a house of 15, 3/5 of the people eat pizza. If Aviana brought pizza with 50 pieces, and each person eating pizza took 4 pieces, calculate the number of pizza pieces that remained.
A: If there are 15 people in the house, the number of people eating pizza is 3 / 5 * 15 = 9 people. If each house member who eats pizza took four pieces to eat, the number of pieces taken is 4 * 9 = 36 pieces. Since the total number of pieces was 50, the number of pieces not taken is 50 - 36 = 14 pieces. The answer is 14.
Question: John is a hack author. He writes a book every 2 months. He has been writing for 20 years and has earned an average of $30,000 per book. How much money has he made writing?
Answer: He writes 12 / 2 = 6 books a year. That means he has written 6 * 20 = 120 books. So he has made 120 * 30,000 = $3,600,000 from writing. The answer is 3600000.
[Question]John starts a TV show. He pays $1000 per episode for the first half of the season. The second half of the season had episodes that cost 120% more expensive. If there are 22 episodes how much did the entire season cost?
[Answer]The season is broken up into 22 / 2 = 11 episode based on cost. The first 11 episodes cost 11 * 1000 = $11,000. The next set of episodes cost 1000 * 1.2 = $1200 more per episode. So they cost 1000 + 1200 = $2200 each. So in total they cost 2200 * 11 = $24200. So in total the season cost 24200 + 11000 = $35,200. The answer is 35200.
Q: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?
A: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $1200 remaining. So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $200 each. Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200 / 5 = $40 each. The answer is 40.
