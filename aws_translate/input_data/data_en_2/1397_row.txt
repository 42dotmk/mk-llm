General average sacrifice is a legal principle in maritime law that deals with the allocation of shared losses and costs incurred by all parties who have an interest in a vessel and its cargo when an extraordinary sacrifice or expenditure is made to preserve the ship and its cargo from a common peril. This concept finds its origins in the Lex Rhodia, an ancient set of sea laws dating back to around 800 BCE from the island of Rhodes, and it remains a fundamental aspect of modern maritime law today.

In a general average sacrifice, when the ship and its cargo are threatened by an imminent danger during a voyage, an intentional and reasonable sacrifice or expenditure can be made by the ship's crew to save the majority of the property. This could involve activities such as jettisoning cargo overboard to lighten the ship in a storm or cutting away damaged masts and rigging. The financial loss resulting from this extraordinary sacrifice or expenditure would then be proportionally shared among all the parties with an interest in the vessel and its cargo.

The concept of general average sacrifice is founded on the idea that all interested parties should contribute to the loss in accordance with the benefits they derive from the common safety of the ship and its cargo. To make such a claim, various conditions need to be met, such as that the circumstances must warrant extraordinary measures, the deliberate action must be reasonable, and there must be actual or imminent danger.

The York-Antwerp Rules, first devised in 1890 and revised multiple times since then, are a set of internationally recognized rules governing general average claims. These rules provide guidelines for the calculation and apportionment of financial loss among ship owners, cargo owners, and other interested parties, such as insurers.

Now, to address the second part of your question, stating that "American companies accepted it in 1949" is an oversimplification and may not accurately reflect the historical developments related to the general average principle in the United States. While the York-Antwerp Rules have been widely adopted around the world, it is important to note that the rules themselves have undergone several revisions over the years, including in 1924, 1950, 1974, and 1994, all of which have had varying levels of acceptance in different jurisdictions. However, it is true that the United States has accepted the general average principle, and the York-Antwerp Rules were incorporated into American maritime law following the adoption of the 1950 version.

In conclusion, the general average sacrifice is a long-standing and fundamental concept in maritime law aimed at the fair apportionment of costs and losses among all parties involved in a common maritime adventure when extraordinary sacrifices are made to preserve the ship and its cargo. While it is correct to say that the United States has accepted the general average principle and the York-Antwerp Rules, referring to a specific date such as 1949 may not be accurate as the York-Antwerp Rules have undergone revisions and updates over the years, with varying levels of acceptance in different countries.
