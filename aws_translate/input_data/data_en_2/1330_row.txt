The answer: 18
Reverse engineering the question: Mark is reading books, for 2 hours each day. He decided to increase his time spent on reading books weekly, by 4 hours. How much time does Mark want to spend during one week on reading books?

Reasoning and answer: He has $2 in $1 bills because 2 times 1 equals 2. He has $5 in $5 bills because 1 times 5 equals 5. He has $3.25 in quarters because 13 times .25 equals 3.25. He has $2 in dimes because 20 times .1 equals 2. He has $.40 in nickels because 8 times .05 equals .4. He has $.35 in pennies because 35 times .01 equals .35. He has $13 because 2 plus 5 plus 3.25 plus 2 plus .4 plus .35 equals 13.
The answer: 13

3 / 5th of 20 liters of water is 20 * (3 / 5) = 12 liters. 5 / 6th of 18 liters of vinegar is 18 * (5 / 6) = 15 liters. 12 liters of water mixed with 15 liters of vinegar gives 12 + 15 = 27 - liter mixture.
The answer: 27
Reverse engineering the question: In a dye-making process, a young lady mixes 3/5th of 20 liters of water with 5/6th of 18 liters of vinegar. How many liters of the mixture are obtained?

Reasoning and answer: He got a discount of 400 * .8 = $320. He got that discount for 3 - 1 = 2 visits. So each of those visits cost 400 - 320 = $80. So he paid 2 * 80 = $160 for those visits. That means he paid a total of 400 + 160 + 100 = $660.
The answer: 660

Kara drinks 4 * 3 = 12 ounces of water with her medication each day. In a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = 84 ounces of water with her medication. In two weeks, she drinks 84 * 2 = 168 ounces of water with her medication. One day, she forgot two tablets, so she did not drink 2 * 4 = 8 ounces of water. Thus, Kara drank 168 - 8 = 160 ounces of water with her medication over two weeks.
The answer: 160
Reverse engineering the question: Kara has to drink 4 ounces of water every time she takes her medication. Her medication instructions are to take one tablet three times a day.

The tickets for both of her brothers will cost her $10 * 2 = $20. To buy tickets for all of them, it will cost Isabelle $20 + $20 = $40. Between all of them, they have saved a total of $5 + $5 = $10. Since they have already saved $10, she needs to earn an additional $40 - $10 = $30 to afford the tickets. Since she makes $3 per week, it will take her $30 / ($3 / week) = 10 weeks to save enough money for all of the tickets.
The answer: 10
