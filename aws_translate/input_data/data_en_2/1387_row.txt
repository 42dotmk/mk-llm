In order to cook muffins into a muffin shape, you will need to follow a specific process and have some essential baking tools. Here is a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to cook muffins into a perfect muffin shape:

1. Gather the necessary tools and ingredients:

To cook the perfect shaped muffins, you will need:

   - Muffin recipe (prepare a suitable recipe, based on your preferences like chocolate chip, blueberry, banana, etc.)
   - Muffin pan (a standard muffin pan has 12 cups, but you can use a mini or jumbo pan based on your needs)
   - Muffin liners (paper or silicone liners)
   - Mixing bowls
   - Whisk or electric mixer
   - A spatula
   - Measuring cups and spoons
   - An ice cream scoop or a spoon to portion the batter
   - A cooling rack

2. Preheat the oven:

Before you start preparing the muffin batter, preheat the oven according to the recipe you have chosen. Generally, muffins are baked at a temperature ranging from 350째F (175째C) to 425째F (220째C) for 18-25 minutes, depending on the recipe and size of the muffins.

3. Prepare the muffin batter:

Follow the recipe instructions to prepare the muffin batter. Typically, it involves combining the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar) in one bowl and the wet ingredients (eggs, milk, oil or butter, and extracts) in another, before gently combining the two mixtures. If your recipe calls for any additional ingredients like fruit, nuts, or chocolate chips, fold them in at the end. Take care not to overmix the batter; mix until just combined to achieve a tender and fluffy muffin texture.

4. Prepare the muffin pan:

Line the muffin pan with paper or silicone muffin liners. This not only helps the muffins retain their shape but also makes it easier to remove them from the pan once they are baked. If you prefer not to use liners, grease the muffin cups with non-stick spray, butter, or oil to prevent the muffins from sticking.

5. Portion the batter:

Using an ice cream scoop or a spoon, divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups. Filling the cups about 2/3 to 3/4 full will allow them to rise and create a rounded top, giving you the classic muffin shape. If you overfill the cups, the muffins might spread and bake onto the surface of the pan.

6. Bake the muffins:

Place the muffin pan in the preheated oven and bake according to your recipe's instructions. Muffins are generally baked for 18-25 minutes, but this can vary depending on the recipe and muffin size. To ensure your muffins are cooked through, insert a toothpick into the center of a muffin; if it comes out clean or with only a few crumbs, the muffins are done.

7. Cool the muffins:

Once they're baked, remove the muffin pan from the oven and let the muffins cool in the pan for about 5 minutes or until they are cool enough to handle. Carefully remove the muffins from the pan and transfer them to a cooling rack. It is important to let the muffins cool before attempting to remove the liners, as this will help them maintain their shape.

By following these steps carefully, you will be able to cook muffins into a perfect muffin shape. Enjoy your delicious, fluffy and well-shaped homemade muffins!
