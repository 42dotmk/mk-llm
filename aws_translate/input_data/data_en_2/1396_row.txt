The country that became the first sovereign state of the 21st century when Indonesia relinquished control on it in May 2002 is East Timor, also known as Timor-Leste. East Timor is situated in Southeast Asia, specifically on the eastern half of the island of Timor, which is located between Indonesia and Australia. It also includes the nearby islands of Atauro and Jaco, as well as the exclave Oecusse, an East Timorese territory surrounded by Indonesian West Timor. The country's capital city is Dili, and the official languages are Tetum and Portuguese. The nation has a population of around 1.3 million people.

The path to Timor-Leste's sovereignty was long and marked by a turbulent history of colonial rule, occupation, and struggle for self-determination. For over 400 years, Portugal colonized the eastern part of Timor island. In November 1975, following the Carnation Revolution and the withdrawal of Portuguese colonial administration, East Timor claimed independence as the Democratic Republic of East Timor. However, only nine days later, the Indonesian military invaded the country and subsequently occupied it, leading to a brutal 24-year-long occupation.

During their occupation, Indonesian forces committed numerous atrocities against the Timorese population, causing an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 deaths. East Timor's struggle for independence continued, with the support of international solidarity movements, and eventually led to a critical turning point in 1999. In the wake of international pressure, the newly elected Indonesian president, B.J. Habibie, agreed to hold a UN-sponsored referendum in East Timor, where the people could choose between autonomy within Indonesia or independence.

On August 30, 1999, the people of East Timor voted overwhelmingly for independence, with 78.5% favoring the separation from Indonesia. Unfortunately, the vote was followed by widespread violence and destruction committed by pro-Indonesian militias and Indonesian military personnel. The United Nations intervened, and an Australian-led International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) was deployed to restore peace and security.

The UN established the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) to oversee the transition to independence, which included drafting a constitution and organizing elections. In 2002, Xanana Gusm√£o, a prominent independence activist and former guerrilla fighter, was elected the nation's first president. Finally, on May 20, 2002, East Timor declared its formal independence as a sovereign state, becoming the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, the first new sovereign nation of the 21st century.

Since gaining independence, Timor-Leste has met with a multitude of challenges, including political instability, economic development, and nation-building tasks. Numerous international and regional organizations, such as the United Nations and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), have provided significant support to enable Timor-Leste's growth and progress. While there is still much work to be done, the people of Timor-Leste continue their journey towards building a stable and prosperous nation.
