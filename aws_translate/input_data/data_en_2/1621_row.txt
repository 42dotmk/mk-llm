Yes, your found answer provides a basic definition of cluster sampling, but it only touches the surface of the concept and doesn't completely address the differences between multistage and cluster sampling. To give you a more comprehensive understanding, let me provide a detailed comparison between the two sampling techniques.

Multistage sampling and cluster sampling are both probability sampling techniques that are employed when studying large and complex populations. They are designed to make the sampling process more efficient and manageable.

Cluster Sampling:

Cluster sampling is a technique used when "natural" but relatively homogeneous groupings are evident in a statistical population. In this method, the entire population is divided into separate clusters, usually based on some shared characteristic or geographical proximity. The clusters should be more or less representative of the population. Then, a random sample of these clusters is selected for the study. All the elements within the chosen clusters are included in the sample.

For instance, if a researcher wants to study the academic performance of high school students in a large city, they may divide the population into clusters based on individual schools. Then, a random sample of schools is selected, and data is collected from all students in those chosen schools.

Advantages of cluster sampling include reduced travel and administrative costs and easier implementation compared to simple random sampling.

Multistage Sampling:

Multistage sampling is an extension of cluster sampling and involves multiple stages of sampling within the selected clusters. In this technique, the population is first divided into clusters, and then, instead of selecting all elements in the chosen clusters, further random samples are drawn from within each selected cluster at different stages. This process can be carried out in multiple stages, depending on the desired sample size and level of detail.

Continuing with the previous high school academic performance example, in a multistage sampling design, the researcher might first choose a set of schools (clusters). Then, within each selected school, a random set of classrooms or specific grades might be chosen. Following this, a random sample of students from within the selected classrooms or grades may be taken. This multi-step approach reduces the overall sample size while still maintaining a fair representation of the population.

Multistage sampling can increase the overall efficiency and accuracy of research findings while reducing the sample size and logistical challenges.

In summary, the main difference between multistage and cluster sampling lies in the additional stages of sampling within the clusters for multistage sampling. While both techniques involve breaking the population into clusters, cluster sampling includes all elements within the chosen clusters, whereas multistage sampling involves multiple stages of random sampling within those selected clusters to obtain the final sample. Each technique has its advantages and can be applied depending on the nature of the study, the required level of accuracy, and the available resources.
