B). yes.

Both questions revolve around the impact of scrapping old 500 and 1000 rupees notes and the introduction of new 500 and 2000 rupees notes on the issue of black money and money laundering in India. These measures are part of an initiative called demonetization, which aimed to eradicate black money and corruption in the country. However, it is essential to explain each aspect in detail to understand if this initiative can offer a permanent solution.

Scrapping old 500 and 1000 rupees notes and demonetization was an effort to address the circulation of black money, which is the income often obtained illegally or without paying the appropriate taxes. These notes accounted for about 86% of the cash in circulation at the time of demonetization, in November 2016. By invalidating these high-value banknotes, the Indian government aimed to flush out black money holders, reduce corruption, and curb the financing of terrorism and other illegal activities.

Although demonetization affected the country's economy in the short term by causing cash shortages and exacerbating deflationary trends, it prompted more citizens and businesses to adopt digital payment methods and conduct banking transactions, thereby increasing transparency within the financial system.

However, saying that demonetization is a permanent solution for eradicating black money may not be entirely accurate. While it did force many black money holders to deposit their illicit funds in banks, black money generation usually depends on deeper structural issues related to tax and regulatory systems. As a result, addressing these underlying issues is essential for a long-term solution to the problem of black money. Moreover, the tax system's complexity needs simplification to encourage compliance and reduce the incentive to generate black money.

The introduction of new banknotes, specifically the 2000 rupees notes, has raised concerns about their potential contribution to money laundering and black money accumulation. While the newly introduced notes were designed with enhanced security features to nullify the risk of forgery, there is still the possibility of these high-value notes being used to store unaccounted-for wealth and conduct illegal transactions.

However, some measures have been taken to mitigate the risk of money laundering and black money generation through the new notes. One such measure is the increased use of digital payments in the economy following demonetization. As digital transactions become more prevalent, the reliance on physical cash decreases, affecting the generation and circulation of black money. Nevertheless, it cannot guarantee complete eradication or prevention of these problems.

In conclusion, though the scrapping of old 500 and 1000 rupees notes and the introduction of new 500 and 2000 rupees notes provided a temporary solution to the black money issue, achieving permanent eradication would depend on addressing underlying structural problems like tax and regulatory systems. Additionally, regardless of the enhanced security features, the newly introduced 2000 rupees notes may still contribute to money laundering and black money if not well-regulated.
