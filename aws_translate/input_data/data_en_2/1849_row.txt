The two questions you've asked are not asking the same thing, they pertain to different aspects of cricket in India.

Now, to answer your questions in detail:

1. The selection in an Indian cricket team, especially at a national level, involves a few steps. Here are details on that process:

• Local Club and School Teams: Start by practicing and honing your skills at a local level by playing in school teams, local cricket club or in district cricket leagues. This is primarily to gain experience and understand the intricacies of the game better.

• Cricket Academies: Next, you might want to consider joining a cricket academy. These academies have experienced coaches who can help refine your skills and teach you the advanced technicalities of cricket.

• District Level Cricket: By playing for your local or district cricket leagues, you may be noticed by state selectors. They choose proficient players and offer them a chance to play at the state level.

• State Level and First Class Cricket: If your performance at the district level stands out, you'll be given opportunity to represent your state. Playing well at the state level can give you an entry into Ranji Trophy, the premier domestic cricket championship in India.

• National Level: Consistently good performances in these tournaments may attract attention of the national selectors who are always on the lookout for potential players for the Indian cricket team. 

• Performance at Every Level: Keep in mind that it's not only about reaching these various levels, it's mainly about performing exceptionally at each level. For you to rise through this hierarchy, your performance, dedication and resilience matter the most.

• Age Groups: Also, there are age-group tournaments like the U-16, U-19 and U-23 conducted by BCCI. By performing well in these tournaments, you get a chance to play for India A and India U-19 teams.

It's to be noted that joining a cricket academy is not compulsory but can be very beneficial for improved training and guidance, especially from a very young age.

 
2. About the representation of different religions in sports, it's essential to understand that selection for the Indian cricket team is based on merit and not on religion or any other communal basis. 

There are several Muslim cricketers, like Zaheer Khan, Mohammad Shami, Irfan Pathan and Yusuf Pathan, who have represented India internationally. It's just that the number might be proportional to the population distribution and also interest and access to facilities and opportunities in the particular sport within different communities. Furthermore, talent doesn't discriminate on the basis of religion. 

It could also be that more Muslim players are not making it to the national team because they are not passing through the rigorous selection and performance criteria set by BCCI, not because of their religion. Talent, consistent performance, fitness, and discipline – these are aspects that determine a cricketer's journey to the Indian team.

In conclusion, the road to becoming a part of the Indian cricket team requires commitment, hard work, consistency and a passion for the game, irrespective of one's religious beliefs.
