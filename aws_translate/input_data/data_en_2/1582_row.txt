Plot:

Act 1:

- The opening scene introduces Slicker Smith (Bud Abbott) and Herbie Brown (Lou Costello), two small-time pickpockets who make a living off unsuspecting people on the bustling streets of New York City. They pick their targets and use their wit, charm, and slapstick comedy to distract, snatch wallets, and evade the law.
  
- One evening, they decide to target an elegant soiree at the mansion of eccentric billionaire Chester Van Treem (Vincent Price). Slicker and Herbie sneak into the party, disguised as waiters, to scope out their potential victims.
  
- While snatching wallets and purses from wealthy party guests, Herbie accidentally lifts a unique amulet from Chester's niece, Lady Victoria (Ingrid Bergman). He shows Slicker their new "score," unaware of the amulet's significance.

Act 2:
  
- The mysterious amulet begins to cause inexplicable events: doors magically opening, constantly changing weather, and peculiar transformations. Slicker and Herbie find themselves pursued by Van Treem's villainous henchmen, who are fiercely determined to retrieve the powerful artifact.
  
- Our comedic pair hilariously stumble into a secret underground society, the "Dominion of Havoc," led by the enigmatic Mr. S (Peter Lorre). This covert group has been searching for the amulet for centuries, believing it holds the key to dominating the world.
  
- Terrified but curious, Slicker and Herbie are tasked by the "Dominion of Havoc" to protect the amulet and learn the secret to unlocking its power. The hapless duo finds themselves facing a series of comedic challenges and obstacles, from deciphering cryptic clues to confronting supernatural entities.

Act 3:
  
- As Slicker and Herbie continue their pursuit of the amulet's secrets, they form unlikely alliances with Lady Victoria, who has a hidden agenda, and a misunderstood stray dog who turns out to be an otherworldly protector of the amulet's power.
  
- The climactic showdown takes place at Van Treem's mansion, with everyone vying for control of the amulet. Meanwhile, Slicker and Herbie, through their misadventures and bumbling mishaps, accidentally stumble upon the true nature of the amulet: a force for unity and peace on Earth, utterly incompatible with greed and malice.
  
- The "Dominion of Havoc" disbands, and Chester Van Treem has a change of heart, thanks to Lady Victoria's persuasion. The now useless amulet is returned to Lady Victoria, and Slicker and Herbie pledge to leave their life of crime behind, with the help of their newly acquired friends.

"Moonlight Mayhem" is a box-office hit, with audiences laughing at the hilarious antics of Abbott and Costello as Slicker Smith and Herbie Brown. The film is a delightful roller coaster of high-energy gags, unexpected twists, and heartwarming resolutions, cementing itself as a beloved classic in the comedy genre.
