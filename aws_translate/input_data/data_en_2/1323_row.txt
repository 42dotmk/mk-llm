Quick Question: In general, the more massive a star is, the shorter its lifespan on the main sequence. After the hydrogen fuel at the core has been consumed, the star evolves away from the main sequence on the HR diagram. The behavior of a star now depends on its mass, with stars below 0.23 M becoming white dwarfs directly, whereas stars with up to ten solar masses pass through a red giant stage.
