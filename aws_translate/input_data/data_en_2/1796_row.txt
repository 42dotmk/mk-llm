The team's total number of goalies and defenders is 3 + 10 = 13. The number of midfielders in the team is twice the number of defenders, which means there are 2 * 10 = 20 defenders in the team. The total number of players in the team playing the positions of goalies, defenders and midfielders is 20 + 13 = 33. If there are 40 players in the team, then the number of strikes in the team is 40 - 33 = 7.
The answer: 7

Reasoning and answer: If the box has four dozen bottles of water, there are 4 * 12 = 48 bottles of water in the box. After the first half, the 11 players take 11 * 2 = 22 bottles of water from the box. If they take 11 more bottles of water at the end of the game, the number increases to 22 + 11 = 33 bottles of water taken. Without the bottles taken, there are 48 - 33 = 15 bottles of water remaining in the box.
The answer: 15

Reasoning and answer: On Saturday, he threw the ball 20 times, and since the temperature was 50 degrees, he could throw only 20 yards, totaling 20 * 20 = 400 yards. On Sunday, the temperature favored him, and he threw the ball twice the distance he could throw on Saturday, which is 2 * 20 = 40 yards. If he threw the ball 30 times, he threw for 30 * 40 = 1200 yards. In the two days, he threw 1200 + 400 = 1600 yards.
The answer: 1600
