Act 1: Prologue and Discovery

The movie opens in the bustling city of Chennai, India, where an elderly man, Gurumoorthy, lives a simple life as an unassuming Mridangam teacher. Despite his immense talent, he never gained fame or recognition in the world of Carnatic music, having chosen instead to focus on his students and the purity of the art.

Meanwhile, a young and ambitious documentary filmmaker, Tara, returns to India from the US. She comes across a recording of one of Gurumoorthy's performances from decades ago, and she is instantly captivated by his unique style and the soul-stirring rhythms he creates. Intrigued, she begins her research on the elusive Mridangam musician, only to discover that little is known about him in the present day.

Parallel to this, Tara documents Gurumoorthy's current life, showcasing his unwavering dedication to his students and his selfless efforts to preserve the ancient art of Mridangam.
