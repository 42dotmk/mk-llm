When a rock is altered by heat from a nearby magma, a process called metamorphism occurs, specifically thermal or contact metamorphism. This is a geological phenomenon by which the rocks change their mineralogical composition, texture, structure, and physical properties as a result of exposure to high temperatures and, to a lesser degree, the introduction of chemically-active fluids released from the magma. The transformed rock is referred to as a metamorphic rock.

There are several key aspects to understanding how rocks alter when exposed to heat from nearby magma:

1. Temperature: The temperature gradient around the magma determines how the original rock, known as protolith, will be affected. Magma temperature typically ranges from 700째C to 1300째C (1300째F to 2400째F), causing the surrounding rocks to heat up. Generally, the closer the rock is to the magma, the higher the temperature experienced, resulting in more profound metamorphism.

2. Minerals: Different minerals will respond distinctively to the heat from the nearby magma. For instance, when clay minerals heated, they alter into mica, and eventually garnet. Similarly, calcite from limestone or marble may react with silica to produce wollastonite. The specific combination of heat, pressure, and mineral chemistry dictates which new minerals will form during metamorphism.

3. Texture and structure: The texture and structure of rocks transform under heat from nearby magma. Firstly, crystal size tends to increase due to the process of recrystallization. This might result in the development of an interlocking mosaic of crystals consistent in size. Secondly, new textural arrangements may emerge as minerals become more thermodynamically stable during the alteration. Thirdly, foliated or banded textures might form in some instances due to the magmatic heat's reorientation of pre-existing minerals.

4. Dehydration and fluid activity: The heat may cause chemical changes in the minerals within the rock, leading to the release of water or other volatiles. These expelled fluids can result in further alteration of the rock, in a process known as metasomatism. This exchange of chemical components can facilitate the formation of new minerals or help transport metal ions, concentrating valuable elements and contributing to the formation of ore deposits.

5. Level of metamorphism: The level of metamorphism experienced by a rock depends on its temperature exposure and proximity to the magma. Lower levels of metamorphism can result in changes in mineralogy and texture without significantly affecting the protolith's structure. In contrast, higher levels of metamorphism may result in complete recrystallization and transformation of the rock into new metamorphic forms.

In summary, when rock is altered by heat from nearby magma, it undergoes metamorphism. This process significantly changes its mineralogical composition, texture, structure, and physical properties. The key factors at play include the magma's temperature and its proximity, minerals within the rock, and hydration or dehydration of the rock. The degree of metamorphism determines the type and scale of alterations experienced by the affected rock.
