The claim that the freedom to move is a human right can be supported by various sources of evidence: international human rights law, philosophical arguments, historical developments, and socio-economic benefits.

1. International Human Rights Law: The right to freedom of movement is enshrined in multiple international human rights documents. These include Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which states that "everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state" and the right to leave and return to one's country. Additionally, Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) protects the right to liberty of movement and the associated freedoms of choosing residence, leaving any country, and returning to one's own country. Such legal provisions emphasize the importance of the freedom to move as an inherent human right.

2. Philosophical Arguments: The philosophical foundation for the right to freedom of movement can be found in the works of various philosophers. For example, John Locke, in his "Two Treatises of Government," argued that individuals have a natural right to life, liberty, and property. Freedom of movement is a crucial component of liberty, allowing people to pursue opportunities, escape oppression, and develop relationships with others. Immanuel Kant also maintained that human beings possess inherent dignity, autonomy, and rationality, which entitle them to certain rights, including freedom of movement.

3. Historical Developments: Throughout history, there have been numerous examples of individuals and groups advocating for the right to freedom of movement. This evolution can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as Greece and Rome, where limited forms of freedom of movement were recognized for certain citizens. The abolition of slavery and the end of apartheid in South Africa are other significant examples where the freedom of movement was recognized as a fundamental human right. Furthermore, the establishment of the European Union and the Schengen Agreement, which allow free movement between member countries, demonstrates an ongoing commitment to the right to move freely.

4. Socio-Economic Benefits: The freedom to move has numerous socio-economic benefits that support its claim as a human right. Migrants can contribute significantly to the economies of both their host and home countries, promoting cultural exchange, fostering innovation, and enhancing the overall well-being of societies. Moreover, the freedom to move enables people to escape poverty and persecution, thereby enhancing their quality of life and helping to reduce global inequalities. In this sense, freedom of movement not only aligns with humanitarian goals but also promotes social and economic development on a global scale.

In summary, the argument that the freedom to move is a human right is supported by various types of evidence. The international human rights law, philosophical underpinnings, historical developments, and socio-economic benefits all contribute to the recognition of the right to move as integral to human dignity, autonomy, and well-being.
