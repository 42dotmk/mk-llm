Solidarity with Iraq and Palestine is integral to the internationalist struggle against neo-liberal globalization.

In this statement, the importance of showing unity and support for the people of Iraq and Palestine in the fight against the harmful impacts of neo-liberal globalization is being highlighted. Neo-liberal globalization is the economic and political project that promotes the liberalization of trade, deregulation, privatization, and the reduction of government's role in the economy. It has greatly influenced global politics and economics over the past few decades.

First, let's focus on the significance of solidarity with Iraq and Palestine. Both countries have faced considerable challenges in the recent past, and these challenges have been exacerbated by the effects of neo-liberal globalization. In Iraq, the country has struggled with political instability, violence, and conflict following the US-led invasion in 2003. The dismantling of the Iraqi state institutions and the implementation of "shock therapy" economic policies have led to widespread poverty and unemployment in the country, fueling conflict and instability.

Similarly, in Palestine, the ongoing Israeli occupation has severely impacted the social, economic, and political conditions faced by the Palestinian people. The Israeli occupation has not only denied Palestinians their basic rights but also undermined their economic development and access to resources. Neo-liberal globalization has reinforced these conditions, as Israeli settlements continue to expand and global powers offer little support for the Palestinian struggle for self-determination and national sovereignty.

The internationalist struggle in this context is an ideological and political movement that seeks to promote international cooperation and solidarity among people and nations across the globe. This struggle opposes the detrimental effects of neo-liberal globalization by advocating for economic and political alternatives that prioritize the welfare of people over profits, promote social justice and democracy, and challenge the hegemony of global powers.

Solidarity with Iraq and Palestine, in this regard, is an essential part of the internationalist effort to challenge the negative consequences of neo-liberal globalization. By standing with these people in their pursuit of justice, self-determination, and resistance against imperialism and occupation, internationalists aim to strengthen the global movement against neo-liberalism and its associated policies. This solidarity is demonstrated through various means, including political, financial, and diplomatic support, grassroots activism, and the promotion of alternative narratives that highlight the struggles and resilience of the people of Iraq and Palestine.

In conclusion, showing solidarity with Iraq and Palestine is a crucial component of the internationalist struggle against neo-liberal globalization. By standing in alliance with those who are marginalized, oppressed, and exploited by powerful global forces, we collectively work toward a more just and equitable world order that respects the rights and aspirations of all people across the globe.
