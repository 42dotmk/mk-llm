Question: Dana has 15 more pencils than Jayden, who has twice as much as Marcus. How many more pencils does Dana have than Marcus, if Jayden has 20 pencils?
Answer: Dana has 15 more pencils than Jayden who has 20, so Dana has 20 + 15 = 35 pencils. Jayden has 20 pencils which is twice as much as Marcus's so Marcus has 20 / 2 = 10 pencils. Dana has 35 - 10 = 25 more pencils than Marcus. The answer is 25.
[Question]Bridgette and Alex are getting married. Bridgette is inviting 84 guests, and Alex is inviting two thirds of that number of guests. They hired a caterer to make a plated meal for each guest at the wedding reception. The caterer always makes ten extra plates just in case something goes wrong. Each plate of steak and asparagus in garlic butter will have 8 asparagus spears on it. How many asparagus spears will the caterer need in all?
[Answer]Alex is inviting 84 * 2 / 3 = 56 guests. Bridgette and Alexâ€™s guests will need 84 + 56 = 140 plates. The caterer makes 10 extra plates, so they will need 140 + 10 = 150 plates. To put 8 asparagus spears on each plate, the caterer will need 150 * 8 = 1200 asparagus spears. The answer is 1200.
Q: Heather is going to sew 150 aprons that are to be used for a kiddie crew program. She already was able to sew 13 aprons, and today, she sewed three times as many aprons. How many aprons should she sew tomorrow if she wants to sew half of the remaining number of aprons needed?
A: Heather has sewn 13 x 3 = 39 aprons today. The total number of aprons sewn is 13 + 39 = 52. Heather needs to sew 150 - 52 = 98 aprons more. So, she needs to sew 98 / 2 = 49 aprons tomorrow. The answer is 49.
Question: What is the average age of the 1st and 5th fastest dogs if the 1st fastest dog is 10 years old, the 2nd fastest dog is 2 years younger than the first fastest dog, the 3rd fastest dog is 4 years older than the 2nd fastest dog, the 4th fastest dog is half the age of the 3rd fastest dog, and the 5th fastest dog is 20 years older than the 4th fastest dog?
Answer: If the 1st fastest dog is 10 years old, and the 2nd fastest dog is 2 years younger than the first fastest dog, the 2nd fastest dog is 10 - 2 = 8 years old. The 3rd fastest dog being 4 years older than the 2nd fastest dog, is 8 + 4 = 12 years old. The 4th fastest dog is half the age of the 3rd fastest dog, meaning the 4th fastest dog is 1 / 2 * 12 = 6 years old. The 5th fastest dog is 20 years older than the 4th fastest dog, meaning the 5th fastest dog is 6 + 20 = 26 years old. The total age of the 1st and 5th fastest dogs is 26 + 10 = 36 years. The average age of the 1st and 5th fastest dogs is 36 / 2 = 18 years old. The answer is 18.
