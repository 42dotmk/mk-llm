[Answer]She has 5 1.5 hour appointments on Monday for a total of 5 * 1.5 = 7.5 hours. She has 2 2 hour appointments on Thursday for a total of 2 * 2 = 4 hours. She is working 7.5 hours on Monday, 3 hours on Tuesday, 4 hours on Thursday and 6 hours on Saturday for a total of 7.5 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 20.5 hours. She charges $20.00 an hour and is working 20.5 hours a week for a total of 20 * 20.5 = $410.00. The answer is 410.
Q: New York recorded 5000 new coronavirus cases on a particular week. In the second week, half as many new coronaviruses cases as the first week was recorded by the state. In the third week, 2000 more cases were recorded in the state. What is the total number of recorded new coronaviruses in the state after the three weeks?
A: If there were 5000 new cases on the first week, the total for the second week is 1 / 2 * 5000 cases = 2500 cases. The total number of new coronavirus cases in the three weeks is 2500 cases + 5000 cases + 2000 cases = 9500 cases. The answer is 9500.

[Question]Ryan works in an office that has an even number of men and women working there. Ryan participates in a meeting composed of 4 men and 6 women who are pulled from the office floor.  This reduces the number of women working on the office floor by 20%. How many people work at Ryan's office?
[Answer]Since 6 women are 20% of the total number of women working there, that means there are 6 * 5 = 30 women working there in total. Since there are an even number of women and men working in the office, that means there are 30 * 2 = 60 people working there in total, since there are 2 sexes. The answer is 60.
Q: Tom, an avid stamp collector, has 3,000 stamps in his collection. He is very sad because he lost his job last Friday. His brother, Mike, and best friend, Harry, try to cheer him up with more stamps. Harry’s gift to Tom is 10 more stamps than twice Mike’s gift. If Mike has given Tom 17 stamps, how many stamps does Tom’s collection now have?
A: Twice the number of stamps given by Mike is 17 stamps * 2 = 34 stamps. Harry therefore gave Tom 10 stamps + 34 stamps = 44 stamps. Combining both gifts gives a gift total of 44 stamps + 17 stamps = 61 stamps. The total number of stamps in Tom’s collection is now 3000 stamps + 61 stamps = 3061 stamps. The answer is 3061.
