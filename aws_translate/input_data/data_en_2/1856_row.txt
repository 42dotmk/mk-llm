Question: A movie theater charges $5 for matinee tickets, $7 for evening tickets, and $10 for opening night tickets. A bucket of popcorn costs $10. On Friday, they had 32 matinee customers, 40 evening customers, and 58 customers for an opening night showing of a movie. If half the customers bought popcorn, how much money in dollars did the theater make on Friday night?
Answer: The movie theater made 5 * 32 = $160 in matinee tickets. It made 7 * 40 = $280 in evening tickets. It made 10 * 58 = $580 in opening night tickets. There were 32 + 40 + 58 = 130 customers. Half of the customers bought popcorn, so 130 / 2 = 65 bought popcorn. Thus, the theater made 10 * 65 = $650 from popcorn. Therefore, in all, the theater made 160 + 280 + 580 + 650 = $1670 on Friday night. The answer is 1670.
[Question]Mr. Rocky went to the market to sell his handmade crafts on a particular week. He was selling jewelry at $30 each and paintings at $100 each. However, he realized the income from the sales wasn't worth the labor and materials he had used, so he decided to increase the price of jewelry by $10 each and the cost of each painting by 20%. Calculate the total price a buyer who takes two pieces of jewelry and five paintings would pay
[Answer]After increasing the price of a piece of jewelry, the price increased from $30 to $30 + $10 = $40 each. He also increased the price of each painting by 20 / 100 * 100 = $20. The total price for buying one painting at the new price is $100 + $20 = $120. If a buyer purchases two pieces of jewelry, the total cost becomes 2 * $40 = $80. When the buyer also buys 5 paintings, he pays a total of $120 * 5 = $600. 2 pieces of jewelry and 5 paintings cost $600 + $80 = $680 at the new prices. The answer is 680.
