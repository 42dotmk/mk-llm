Carson, after reading Jan's letter, experiences a rush of emotions, primarily anger and frustration. The content of the letter must have deeply affected Carson, triggering the need for an immediate conversation with Jan. Consequently, there are several steps that Carson will most likely want to take in order to address the situation:

1. Take a moment to calm down: Before approaching Jan, it's essential that Carson processes their immediate emotional reaction. This could involve taking deep breaths, going for a walk, or allowing some time to pass for the initial anger to subside. A calm and level-headed mindset would enable a more productive discussion and prevent impulsive decisions.

2. Reflect on the contents of the letter: Once Carson is calmer, they should re-read the letter to gain a thorough understanding of what exactly upset them. It's also important for Carson to consider Jan's point of view and ask themselves why Jan might have written those words. By understanding both perspectives, Carson can ensure a balanced and fair conversation.

3. Prepare for the conversation: Carson should write a list of points they want to address. This will help organize their thoughts and provide a clear structure for the conversation. Carson should be prepared to express how the letter made them feel, highlight specific areas of concern, and propose potential resolutions.

4. Arrange a meeting with Jan: Once the preparation is complete, Carson must decide on the most appropriate way to confront Jan. It could be through a face-to-face conversation, a phone call, or even a video call. Depending on the nature of their relationship, Carson ought to choose a mode of communication that feels most comfortable but also ensures an honest and open discussion.

5. Maintain a respectful and open-minded approach: During the conversation, Carson should remain respectful, listening actively to Jan's point of view, and avoiding blame or accusations. They should communicate their feelings and concerns assertively without resorting to aggressive language or dismissing Jan's perspective. Both parties should be open to finding common ground and working towards a resolution.

6. Reach a resolution or set a plan for moving forward: At the end of the conversation, Carson and Jan will ideally have either resolved their issue or developed a plan for moving forward. This could involve an apology, a commitment to better communication, or a follow-up conversation to check in on progress.

7. Reflect on the experience: Finally, Carson should take some time to reflect on the situation, assess whether the conversation was productive, and consider any personal growth or insights that may have emerged from the confrontation. This self-reflection can help Carson in future similar circumstances and contribute to the overall personal development.

In conclusion, Carson's next step would be to calm down, carefully reflect on the contents of the letter and their feelings, and approach Jan with a well-structured conversation. By doing so, Carson can effectively address the situation, maintain a respectful and open-minded approach, and work towards a possible resolution of the conflict.
