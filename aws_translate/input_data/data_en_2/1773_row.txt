While the provided sentence does offer some insight into the architectural influences during the mid-18th century in Britain, it does not explicitly answer the question, "What direction did British architecture go in mid-18th century?" To adequately answer that question, it is necessary to delve deeper into the broader architectural climate in Britain around that time and examine how the mentioned works contributed to shaping those trends.

The mid-18th century in Britain corresponds to a period known as the Georgian era (1714-1830), named after the reigns of Kings George I-IV. Architecturally, this period was marked by a departure from the earlier, more opulent Baroque style, which featured grand ornamentation, in favor of more symmetrical and restrained designs rooted in classical antiquity. This architectural shift was part of a broader cultural movement known as Neoclassicism, which emphasized the rediscovery and emulation of Greco-Roman art, architecture, and principles.

In this context, the publication of works such as "The Antiquities of Athens and Other Monuments of Greece" and Robert Wood's "Palmyra and Baalbec" played a significant role in driving change in British architectural styles. "The Antiquities of Athens," authored by James Stuart and Nicholas Revett, was published in four volumes between 1762 and 1816. This work provided architects and designers with accurate drawings of ancient Greek buildings, columns, and pediments, which supplemented the understanding of Classical Greek architecture. Moreover, it also played a crucial role in popularizing Greek Revival architecture in Britain.

Robert Wood's "Palmyra and Baalbec," published in 1753, documented the detailed measurements and illustrations of ancient ruins in Palmyra, Syria, and Baalbec, Lebanon. The focus on these ancient architectural masterpieces, which blended Greco-Roman and Oriental styles, contributed to the growing fascination with and appreciation for classical principles. These books, along with other influential publications like Giovanni Battista Piranesi's etchings of ancient Rome, helped to create a fascination with returning to more classical architectural features.

As a result, British architects of the mid-18th century began incorporating Neoclassical elements into their designs. Buildings from this period typically featured characteristics such as symmetrical facades, columns with classical orders (Doric, Ionic, or Corinthian), pediments, and minimal ornamentation, allowing for a more refined and harmonious appearance. Examples of Georgian architecture with Neoclassical influences include London's Somerset House, Syon House in West London, and the Royal Crescent and Circus in Bath.

To summarize, the direction in which British architecture went in the mid-18th century was mainly towards Neoclassicism, characterized by a renewed appreciation for classical antiquity and a more restrained and elegant style. Works like "The Antiquities of Athens and Other Monuments of Greece" and Robert Wood's "Palmyra and Baalbec" were very influential in disseminating knowledge about ancient architectural styles and promoting this shift to Neoclassical architecture in Britain.
