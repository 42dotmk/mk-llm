Question: A school cafeteria uses ground mince to cook lasagnas and cottage pies. They make 100 lasagnas, which use 2 pounds of ground mince each, and cottage pies, which use 3 pounds of ground mince each. If the cafeteria has used 500 pounds of ground mince in total, how many cottage pies did they make?
Answer: The cafeteria used 100 lasagnas * 2 pounds of ground mince = 200 pounds of ground mince for the lasagnas. This means they used 500 pounds of ground mince in total â€“ 200 pounds of ground mince for the lasagnas = 300 pounds of ground mince for the cottage pies. So they must have made 300 pounds of ground mince for the cottage pies / 3 pounds of ground mince per cottage pie = 100 cottage pies. The answer is 100.

Q: Casey is pumping water out of her well. She can pump 3 gallons a minute. She has 4 rows of 15 corn plants each, and each plant needs half a gallon of water. She also has 10 pigs, which each need 4 gallons of water, and 20 ducks that each need a quarter of a gallon of water. How many minutes does Casey need to spend pumping water?
A: First find how many corn plants there are: 15 plants / row * 4 rows = 60 plants. Then find how many gallons of water of the corn needs: 60 plants * 1 / 2 gallon / plant = 30 gallons. Then find how many gallons of water the pigs need: 10 pigs * 4 gallons / pig = 40 gallons. Then find how many gallons of water the ducks need: 20 ducks * 1 / 4 gallon / duck = 5 gallons. Now add up all three quantities of water to find the total water needed: 5 gallons + 40 gallons + 30 gallons = 75 gallons. Now divide the total water needed by Casey's pumping rate to find how long she spends pumping: 75 gallons / 3 gallons / minute = 25 minutes. The answer is 25.
Question: A bicycle store is running a promotion. Every time a customer buys a bicycle, they will receive 2 bike clamps free with it. If the store sells 19 bikes in the morning and 27 bikes in the afternoon, how many bike clamps has the store given to customers?
Answer: In the morning, the store gives away 19 bikes * 2 bike clamps = 38 bike clamps. In the afternoon, they give away 27 bikes * 2 bike clamps = 54 bike clamps. So in total, the store has given away 38 + 54 = 92 bike clamps. The answer is 92.
[Question]There are 15 cats in a shelter. One-third were adopted, and were replaced with twice the amount that were adopted. Later on, twice as many dogs showed up as there are cats. How many total animals are there in the shelter?
[Answer]15 / 3 = 5 cats were adopted out of 15. There were 15 - 5 = 10 cats left. 5 * 2 = 10 more cats were added. This makes 10 + 10 = 20 cats in the shelter. 20 * 2 = 40 dogs came into the shelter. There are now 20 + 40 = 60 animals in the shelter. The answer is 60.
