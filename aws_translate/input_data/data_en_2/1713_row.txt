In these difficult circumstances, it is very difficult for Georgia to hold on to everything that is actually its responsibility nowadays.

In challenging situations like the one mentioned, Georgia faces numerous difficulties in fulfilling its modern-day obligations and responsibilities. As a nation, it has to deal with several internal and external factors that put immense pressure on the government as well as the citizens. These factors can vary from political issues, economic obstacles, social unrest, and even environmental challenges that may threaten the overall wellbeing of the nation.

Firstly, political issues are a significant concern in Georgia. The government must constantly strive to maintain internal stability, foster democracy, and nurture transparency in governance. This is essential to ensure that there is no room for corruption, undue influence, or power imbalances affecting the nation's decision-making process. Also, Georgia needs to strike the right balance between retaining its cultural identity and working alongside international partners, thus strengthening its geopolitical position.

Secondly, the economic obstacles for Georgia are also massive, as the country has to deal with disparities in income and wealth distribution. The government needs to ensure that economic growth is inclusive and can benefit all sections of society, not just a select few. To overcome these challenges, Georgia is required to invest in education, infrastructure, and sustainable development, all of which demand significant budgets and resources. Moreover, the change in global trade dynamics and economic interdependencies means that Georgia needs to work on maintaining a robust partnership with regional and global trade partners to protect and grow its market interests.

Social unrest can also contribute to Georgia's difficulties in fulfilling its responsibilities. Various socio-cultural issues often give rise to conflicts within the nation, leading to tensions between different groups. Matters such as minority rights, gender equality, and improving social welfare demand the government's attention and effort. Only by addressing these issues can the country attain social harmony and progress, allowing it to carry out its responsibilities effectively.

Moreover, environmental challenges, such as climate change and natural disasters, have become a more significant concern than ever before. As a nation, Georgia must work on formulating and implementing environmentally-sustainable policies that will benefit not only its people but the entire planet. This involves cooperation on an international level, which can be both rewarding and complex at the same time.

In conclusion, as Georgia grapples with these difficult circumstances, it must navigate an intricate web of internal and external issues to fulfill its modern-day responsibilities. By addressing these challenges through good governance, sustainable development, and international cooperation, the country can strive to both maintain its cultural identity and contribute to global progress. This way, Georgia can work towards overcoming the obstacles and forging a strong, prosperous, and resilient nation.
