The statement made by President Vladimir Putin about Russia working on new nuclear missile systems emphasizes the complex dynamics of global security and the continued importance of nuclear weapons in ensuring national protection. The development of such systems is a strategic move by Russia to stay ahead of other powers, as well as to assess potential security threats posed by other nations and adapt their defense mechanisms accordingly.

In recent years, there have been significant advancements in missile technology, prompting countries all over the world to upgrade their systems to maintain an advantage. This is especially true for nuclear-armed nations whose policies revolve around deterrence, where the primary objective is to discourage potential adversaries from using nuclear weapons against them.

Putin's announcement highlights Russia's ongoing efforts to strengthen and modernize its armed forces. This can be seen as a response to several factors, including changes in the geopolitical landscape, the rise of new powers, and technological advancements. Such developments have a direct impact on the balance of power, compelling states to reassess and modify their defense capabilities to maintain a strategic edge.

Moreover, international arms control agreements, like the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty) and the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START Treaty), have significantly shaped the field of nuclear missile systems. The INF Treaty, which banned medium-range missiles, was signed between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1987, but the United States withdrew in August 2019, citing Russian violations of the treaty. The New START Treaty, signed between Russia and the US in 2010, is set to expire in 2021, and its future remains uncertain.

The dissolution of these treaties and the potential end of nuclear arms control may have severe implications on global security, with the likelihood of renewed arms races and increased tensions between nuclear states. In this context, Putin's statements on new missile systems not only signal Russia's commitment to its national security but also bring to light broader concerns about the stability of the current international order.

Additionally, the development of missile defense systems by the US and NATO constitutes another layer of complexity. These systems, designed to intercept and neutralize incoming missiles, have been met with suspicion by Russia, which perceives them as undermining its nuclear deterrent capability. Such perceptions have further fueled Russia's resolve to develop advanced missile systems that can evade and overcome these defense measures.

In conclusion, President Vladimir Putin's announcement about Russia working on new nuclear missile systems pertains to the realm of "World" affairs. This development underscores the challenges of global security in an ever-evolving international landscape, marked by shifting alliances and technological advancements. It also emphasizes the ongoing importance of nuclear deterrence and arms control agreements in maintaining peace and stability worldwide.
