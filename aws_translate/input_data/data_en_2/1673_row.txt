If we assume that the premise "The natural aggregation of work activities and tasks performed for program delivery" is true, we can analyze it in terms of the hypothesis "Work activities include administrative and management tasks" to determine the relationship between these two statements.

First, let's break down the premise:

1. Natural aggregation - this suggests that the process of grouping together work activities and tasks is inherent and not artificially imposed.
2. Work activities and tasks - these relate to the specific actions and assignments carried out in the process of program delivery.
3. Program delivery - this involves successfully executing a plan, project, or initiative according to its intended purpose.

Based on these components, the premise implies that there is an innate tendency for work activities and tasks to naturally group together, leading to the efficient execution of a program.

Now, let's consider the hypothesis:

1. Work activities - this overlaps with the premise, referring to actions and assignments carried out in the process of program delivery.
2. Administrative and management tasks - these are specific types of work activities that involve organizing, coordinating, and overseeing resources, processes, and people to achieve program delivery goals.

Connecting the premise with the hypothesis, we can infer that if work activities naturally aggregate for program delivery, and if administrative and management tasks are types of work activities, then including these tasks within the natural aggregation supports the efficient execution of a program.

To further delve into this relationship, we must examine the roles of administrative and management tasks in program delivery. Administrative tasks usually involve activities like record-keeping, documentation, scheduling, communication, and procurement. These are essential in maintaining the structure and organization that guides a program towards its objectives.

Management tasks, on the other hand, involve decision-making, goal-setting, resource allocation, delegation, team coordination, and monitoring performance. These tasks are crucial in ensuring that the program stays on track, adapts to any changes, and achieves its intended outcomes.

Considering that administrative and management tasks are integral to successful program delivery, it is reasonable to assume that they are part of the natural aggregation of work activities and tasks. Without these tasks, the program would likely lack the necessary structure and direction, leading to inefficiencies and potential failure.

In conclusion, if we accept the premise that there is a natural aggregation of work activities and tasks for program delivery, and given the importance of administrative and management tasks in this process, it is indeed valid to infer that the hypothesis, "Work activities include administrative and management tasks" holds true. Efficient program delivery requires not only the execution of tasks related to the program's core objectives but also the presence of supportive work activities such as administration and management to ensure a well-organized, coordinated, and goal-oriented approach.
