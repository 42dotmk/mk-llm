Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the La Camorra mine is a dangerous place to work. The fact that the mine has a ramp leading to multiple underground levels does not inherently imply that the working conditions are hazardous. However, mining industries do commonly face potential danger and risks associated with working underground. In order to draw a well-informed conclusion about the safety of working at the La Camorra mine, several factors would need to be considered.

1. Safety Regulations and Compliance: Assess whether the mine complies with local, national, and international safety regulations. This would cover aspects such as appropriate ventilation, illumination, emergency protocols, and the proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for workers.

2. Training: The quality and frequency of safety training sessions for workers can significantly impact the level of danger at the mine. This would include training on proper equipment handling, addressing hazards related to the specific mining techniques employed, and recognizing and responding to signs of potential threats like rock falls, explosions, or water ingress.

3. Work Practices: Safe practices for activities like drilling, blasting, haulage, and support installation are crucial in ensuring a low-risk work environment. It is important to assess whether these practices are being followed correctly and if any deficiencies exist.

4. Monitoring Systems and Risk Management: Regular inspections and monitoring of the mineâ€™s conditions can help identify and mitigate risks. This would involve monitoring for air quality, ground stability, and the presence of hazardous gases like methane or carbon monoxide. Institutions like the La Camorra mine should have established risk management procedures to identify, manage, and communicate any emerging hazards effectively.

5. Incident Records: Reviewing the history of safety-related incidents at the mine can help determine whether it has a higher than normal frequency of accidents or injuries. Comparing these records to industry benchmarks or similar mines can provide insights into the relative safety of working at La Camorra mine.

6. Geotechnical and Geological Conditions: The stability of the mine depends on the nature of the rock and the geological structures present within the deposit. Some mines may experience higher levels of instability and risk due to these factors.

7. Equipment and Infrastructure: Properly maintained equipment and infrastructure can significantly reduce the risk of accidents. It is necessary to check whether the mine has an adequate maintenance schedule and modern safety systems in place.

In summary, while it is not possible to draw the conclusion that the La Camorra mine is a dangerous place to work based solely on the presence of a ramp with a -15% grade, it is crucial to consider various factors, such as safety regulations, training, work practices, risk management, incident records, geotechnical conditions, and equipment maintenance. By analyzing these aspects, one could gain a better understanding of the safety conditions at the La Camorra mine.
