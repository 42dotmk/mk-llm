Q: Jason has a moray eel that eats 20 guppies a day and 5 betta fish who each eat 7 guppies a day. How many guppies per day does she need to buy?
A: First find the total number of guppies the betta fish need: 5 fish * 7 guppies / fish = 35 guppies. Then add the number of guppies the eel needs to find the total number needed: 35 guppies + 20 guppies = 55 guppies. The answer is 55.
Question: Lillian went out to forage for mushrooms with her handy guidebook. She found 32 mushrooms and used her guidebook to identify which ones were poisonous and which were safe to eat. In the end, she had 9 mushrooms she could safely eat for dinner. Of the rest, she identified twice the amount she ate as poisonous, and a remaining bunch she was uncertain about. How many mushrooms was she uncertain were safe or poisonous?
Answer: Lillian found 9 of the mushrooms were safe, so there were 32 - 9 = 23 that she found poisonous or uncertain. She knew twice the amount she ate were poisonous, so she found 9 * 2 = 18 poisonous mushrooms. Thus, she was uncertain about 23 - 18 = 5 mushrooms. The answer is 5.
[Question]Jason is making sand art. He wants to fill a rectangular patch 6 inches by 7 inches with blue sand, and a square path 5 inches by 5 inches with red sand. If it takes 3 grams of sand to fill one square inch, how many grams of sand does Jason need?
[Answer]First find the area of the first patch: 6 inches * 7 inches = 42 inches. Then find the area of the second patch: 5 inches * 5 inches = 25 inches. Then add those two amounts to find the total area Jason needs to cover: 42 inches + 25 inches = 67 inches. Then multiply that area by the number of grams per square inch to find the total amount of sand needed: 67 inches * 3 grams / square inch = 201 grams. The answer is 201.
Q: Rita put a $120 elliptical machine on layaway at her local sports good store. After making a down payment equal to half the cost of the machine, she completely forgot about it.
