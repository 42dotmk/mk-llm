Detailed Plot:

Act One:
Our story begins in the quaint, picturesque town of Sagayama, where we meet Sawako Kuronuma, a shy and introverted high school girl who struggles to make friends and connect with her peers. Sawako is often misunderstood by her classmates due to her unique appearance and her uncanny resemblance to the eerie protagonist from the famous horror film "The Ring." This has earned her the nickname 'Sadako,' which she's never liked, but feels powerless to change.

As the school year progresses, Sawako is paired with a group of students, including the school's most popular boy, Kazehaya, and her bright and bubbly future best friend, Yukari, for a school project. While the classmates initially judge Sawako by her appearance, they soon come to realize that she's a genuinely kind-hearted and talented individual.

Act Two:
Inspired by her newfound friends, Sawako slowly starts to gain confidence in herself. It becomes apparent that she has a unique ability to communicate and empathize with animals. Wanting to expand her horizons, Sawako joins the school's animal-care club which enables her to shine and display her true passions.

At one point, an unfortunate event occurs when the school's beloved mascot, a rescued dog named Koro, goes missing. Sawako leads her group of friends on a mission to rescue the lost dog. She uses her ability to understand and empathize with animals to connect with Koro, who is also misunderstood and isolated, just like her.

Act Three:
During the climactic scene, Sawako and her friends eventually find Koro trapped in a dangerous situation involving a landslide at the outskirts of the town. Sawako's unique talents, incredible courage, and persistence are instrumental in rescuing the dog, overcoming her fears, and saving the day.

News of Sawako's heroism spreads throughout the school and the town of Sagayama. Her once misunderstanding classmates come to appreciate her incredible gifts, and Sawako is finally recognized for her incredible personality and wonderful talents that had been hidden beneath her shy exterior.

Epilogue:
As the movie concludes, Sawako has now found her place at high school and is enjoying her life as a regular teenage girl, surrounded by supportive friends - both human and animal - who love her for who she truly is.
