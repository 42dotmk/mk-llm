Rating: ★★★★★

b) Positive Review:

"The Little Things" is a brilliantly crafted crime drama that transports viewers to the unsettling landscape of a thrill-driven, late 1990s Los Angeles. Director John Lee Hancock has ingeniously weaved a tale of mystery, guilt, and self-reflection, all underscored by the relentless pursuit of justice.

Denzel Washington leads a stellar cast with absolute finesse as Joe "Deke" Deacon, a shrewd, introverted Kern County Deputy who is drawn, almost serendipitously, into a series of murders bearing an uncanny resemblance to an unresolved case from his past. Washington's portrayal of Deke is mesmerizing, with his masterful ability to convey the character's inner turmoil through the subtlest of expressions - a furrowed brow, a lingering gaze - alluding to a man tormented by past mistakes.

Rami Malek's performance as the ambitious LA detective, Jim Baxter, is equally compelling, offering a stark contrast to his portrayal of Freddie Mercury in "Bohemian Rhapsody." Malek delivers a complex character, bringing together the conflicting aspects of Baxter's personality - his ambitious drive, fragile arrogance, and thirst for redemption - as he wrestles with a case that seems perpetually out of grasp.

The undeniable show-stealer, however, is the chilling performance of Jared Leto as the elusive, eccentric prime suspect, Albert Sparma. Leto's reinvention as this slim and enigmatic loner is nothing short of captivating, balancing the character's eerie intelligence and veiled menace with moments of dark humor and unexpected empathy.

The film's pacing is calculated and deliberate, adding to the overall sense of unease as the case unfolds. A remarkable feat of filmmaking, "The Little Things" does not rely on gimmicky jump scares or graphic violence to unnerve its viewers. Instead, it ventures deep into the psychology of human nature, steering the audience to confront the unsettling truths lurking in our collective human id. The cinematography, with its dark shadows draped over sprawling cityscapes, echoes the style of a classic neo-noir, further enshrouding us in a cloak of moral ambiguity.

Moreover, the score composed by Thomas Newman perfectly complements the visual narrative, combining earthy dissonance with haunting melodies that gradually build tension and enhance the atmosphere.

In spite of the dark thematic elements, "The Little Things" does not fail to provide moments of catharsis and redemption, as the multi-layered characters wrestle with their pasts and face the full spectrum of their humanity - sometimes flawed, but always deeply resonating.

"The Little Things" offers an intense viewing experience, thoughtfully capturing the fragility of the human condition and our perpetual struggle between good and evil. Joined by the exceptional talents of Washington, Malek, and Leto, this film is a testament to the power of great storytelling, and it is sure to leave audiences questioning their own moral compass long after the credits roll. A must-watch for fans of crime drama and psychological thrillers alike.
