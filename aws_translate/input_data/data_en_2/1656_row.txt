Members of the United States Congress, which consists of two houses - the Senate and the House of Representatives - are chosen through a combination of direct elections and political party nominations. Each state has its own process for nominating, electing, and readmitting members of Congress. Here is a detailed explanation of the process:

1. The Election Process:
In general, members of Congress are elected through direct elections held in each of the 50 states in the United States. The Constitution of the United States mandates that members of the House of Representatives are elected every two years, while Senators serve six-year terms, with one-third of the Senate being elected every two years.

2. Candidate Nomination:
Before an individual can run for a seat in Congress, they must first be nominated by their political party. In the United States, the two major political parties, the Democrats and the Republicans, hold primary elections or caucuses in each state to select their candidates for the general election. Candidates may also run as independents or members of third parties, but these candidates typically face a more difficult path to election as they often lack the resources and support of the major parties.

3. Running for Office:
Once a candidate has been nominated, they must run for office against other nominated candidates in the general election. This involves campaigning, mobilizing supporters, raising funds, and participating in candidate debates among other activities. The candidate who receives the most votes in the general election is declared the winner and will serve as a member of Congress representing their state.

4. Readmission of Members:
In some cases, such as the one mentioned in the context of the question, members from previously seceded states had to be readmitted to Congress following the Civil War. In the case of Tennessee, the state had to meet certain conditions, such as ratifying the Fourteenth Amendment, before its elected members could be readmitted to Congress. Tennessee was the first to do so and, as a result, did not have a military governor during the Reconstruction period.

5. Vacancies and Special Elections:
If a member of Congress dies, resigns, or is expelled, a special election may be held to fill the vacant seat. The processes for calling and conducting special elections vary by state and sometimes even by the particular circumstances of the vacancy. Governors may also appoint temporary replacements for vacant Senate seats until a special election can be held.

It is important to note that the rules and procedures for choosing members of Congress have evolved significantly since the Civil War era, making the process generally more inclusive and democratic today. The context provided in the question refers specifically to a unique historical period during the Reconstruction era, when the United States was grappling with the reintegration of seceded states and various other political issues. However, the general principles of direct elections and party nominations remain similar across historical periods and serve as the foundation for choosing members of Congress in the modern United States.
