Title: Acapulco Police Hunting for Gang Behind Brutal Attack on Spanish Tourists

Acapulco, a once-popular tourist destination in Mexico, is now facing another wave of violence after a savage attack on a group of Spanish tourists. The local police are searching for a gang of five masked men who targeted a rented beach house and unleashed a terrifying, hours-long assault on the individuals inside.

The Mexican coastal city saw a horrific incident this week, when the armed attackers burst into the beach house and held the six male tourists hostage. According to reports from CNN, the men were tied up, while their six female companions were subjected to an appalling series of assaults. Each of the women was raped by the intruders in an attack that lasted for several hours.

Authorities have confirmed that the attack on the Spanish tourists does not appear to be linked to the ongoing drug cartel war in the region. However, the area is no stranger to violence, with clashes between rival criminal gangs responsible for numerous deaths in recent years. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) has reported that the distinction between drug war-related incidents and local criminal activity has gradually blurred, making it more difficult to determine the motives behind such attacks.

The Mayor of Acapulco, Luis Walton, was quick to publicly condemn the appalling assault on the Spanish tourists. However, his initial comments have sparked controversy, with some critics accusing him of displaying a lack of sensitivity towards the victims. Walton initially stated that such attacks "happen anywhere in the world," a comment he later apologized for, claiming it had been misinterpreted. A statement from the mayor's office read: "The mayor very much laments the misinterpretation of his comments, which were never intended to hurt the victims or minimize the facts."

In addition to the pursuit of the attackers, the Mexican authorities have taken the six Spanish women into their protection and provided them with consular assistance. The victims, aged between 20 and 34, are now being given the support they need following the traumatic events.

The attack on the Spanish tourists has further tarnished Acapulco's already damaged image as a popular vacation spot. The city was a famous Hollywood getaway during the 1950s and has long been a favorite for US Spring Breakers, but the upsurge of violence in recent years has proven costly for the local tourism industry. Walton's admission, in his statement, suggests that the authorities are well aware of the lasting impact this brutal attack will have on the area's image.

Currently, Acapulco remains on edge as the manhunt for the five armed and masked assailants continues. Local efforts to restore the city's image as a safe and family-friendly destination will face significant challenges, particularly in the wake of incidents like this assault on innocent tourists. The Mexican police and government officials will need to demonstrate their commitment to tackling crime and ensuring the safety of their citizens and visitors alike if they are to redeem the reputation of this once-thriving coastal resort.
