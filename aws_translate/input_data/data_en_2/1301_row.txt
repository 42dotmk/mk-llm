Question: When it rains, the three holes in the garage roof leak water at different rates. The largest hole leaks at a rate of 3 ounces of water per minute. The medium-sized hole leaks water at one-half the rate of the largest hole. And the smallest hole leaks water at a rate of one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole. When it rains, what is the combined amount of water, in ounces, that leak from all three holes over a 2-hour time period?
Answer: The medium - sized hole leaks at a rate of one - half that of the largest hole, or 3 / 2 = 1.5 ounces per minute. The small - sized hole leaks at a rate of one - third that of the medium - sized hole, or 1.5 / 3 = 0.5 ounces per minute. Combined, the three holes leak at a rate of 3 + 1.5 + 0.5 = 5 ounces per minute. Since one hour is 60 minutes, two hours is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. In total, over the two hours, the three holes will leak a combined 120 * 5 = 600 ounces of water. The answer is 600.

Q: In a race, there are eight runners. The first five runners finish the race in 8 hours, while the rest of the runners finish the race 2 hours later. Calculate the total time the eight runners took to finish the race.
A: The first five runners took a combined total of 5 * 8 = 40 hours to finish the race. The number of runners who finished the race 2 hours later after the first five is 8 - 5 = 3. The 3 runners who finished the race 2 hours later took a total of 8 + 2 = 10 hours to run the race. Together, the three runners who finished the race in 10 hours took a total of 10 * 3 = 30 hours. All eight runners took 30 + 40 = 70 hours altogether to finish the race. The answer is 70.
Question: Ten friends decide to get an end-of-year gift for their teacher. They plan to split the cost of the gift equally. But four of the group drop out. The remaining friends split the cost equally among themselves. If each share is now $8 more, how much does the gift cost, in dollars?
Answer: Let N be the original price each friend was going to pay. 10N = 6(N + 8). 10N = 6N + 48. 4N = 48. N = 12. Then the present costs 10 * 12 = 120. The answer is 120.
[Question]Emery and Serena go to their school library, and each borrows a copy of The life of Jack Steve's book to read for their school project. If Emery can read five times as fast as Serena, and the book takes her 20 days to read, what's the average number of days the two take to read the book?
[Answer]If Emery took twenty days to read the book, then it took Serena 5 * 20 = 100 days to read the whole book. The total number of days taken by the two to read the book is 100 + 20 = 120 days. The average number of days the two take to read the book is 120 / 2 = 60 days. The answer is 60.
