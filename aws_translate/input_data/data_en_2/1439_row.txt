[Question]Nicole has three older sisters. After each one outgrows their clothes, they give them to Nicole. They have all outgrown their clothes and have given them all to Nicole. Nicole started with 10 pieces of clothing. Her first older sister had half as many clothes as Nicole. The next oldest sister had 2 more pieces of clothing than Nicole. The oldest had the average of what her three younger sisters had. How many pieces of clothing does Nicole end up with?
[Answer]The first sister has 5 pieces of clothing because 10 / 2 = 5. The next sister had 12 pieces of clothing because 10 + 2 = 12. The three youngest sisters combined have 27 pieces because 10 + 5 + 12 = 27. The oldest has 9 pieces because 27 / 3 = 9. Nicole ends up with 36 pieces of clothing because 10 + 5 + 12 + 9 = 36. The answer is 36.
Q: After eating half of the number of fruits he had, Martin remained with twice as many oranges as limes. If he has 50 oranges now, how many fruits did he initially have?
A: Since the number of oranges that Martin has now is twice the number of limes, there are 50 / 2 = 25 limes. The number of fruits she has now is 50 oranges + 25 limes = 75. If she had eaten half of the number of fruits that she had, initially Martin had 2 * 75 = 150 fruits. The answer is 150.
Question: Tricia ordered three dozen eggs. She will use 1/4 of them for making crepes, and 2/3 of the remaining for making cupcakes. How many eggs are left to make sunny-side-up eggs for breakfast?
Answer: Since a dozen is equal to 12, then 3 dozen eggs are equal to 12 x 3 = 36 eggs. Tricia will use 36 x 1 / 4 = 9 eggs for making crepes. So there are 36 - 9 = 27 eggs left. 27 x 2 / 3 = 18 eggs will be used for making cupcakes. Thus, there are only 27 - 18 = 9 eggs left to make sunny - side - up eggs for breakfast. The answer is 9.
[Question]Mr. Johnson is organizing the school Christmas play and needs 50 volunteers to help with decorating the auditorium. 5 students from each of the schoolâ€™s 6 math classes have volunteered to help. 13 teachers have also volunteered to help. How many more volunteers will Mr. Johnson need?
[Answer]Since 5 students from each of the 6 math classes have volunteered, there are 5 * 6 = 30 total student volunteers. In addition to the 30 student volunteers, 13 teachers have also volunteered so there are 30 + 13 = 43 total volunteers. Mr. Johnson needs 50 volunteers and currently has 43 volunteers, so he needs 50 - 43 = 7 more volunteers. The answer is 7.
Q: Benny is baking pies for a bake sale. He plans to make ten pumpkin pies, which cost $3 each to make, and twelve cherry pies, which cost $5 each to make. If he wants to make a profit of $20 selling all the pies, how much does he have to charge for each pie if both kinds sell at the same price?
A: Benny will spend 3 * 10 = $30 to make the pumpkin pies. He will spend 5 * 12 = $60 to make the cherry pies. He wants to make a profit of $20, so he has to earn 30 + 60 + 20 = $110 selling all the pies. He is making 22 pies, so he needs to charge 110 / 22 = $5 per pie. The answer is 5.
