Title: Mastering the Native Japanese Style of Counting: Steps for Beginners

Introduction

Learning a new language can be challenging yet rewarding, and understanding the counting system is a critical part of mastering any language. In Japanese, there are various counting methods used depending on the situation and the items being counted. In this article, we will focus on the native Japanese style counting – "Wago" (和語) – and guide you through the fundamental steps of counting from 1 to 10.

Step 1: Familiarize yourself with the native Japanese style counting

Before diving into the numbers, it's essential to understand that Japanese has two sets of numerals – the Sino-Japanese numbers (Kango), which are based on the Chinese numeral system, and the native Japanese numbers (Wago). Wago is used in more casual and informal situations, such as counting age, small objects, and general counting. Recognizing when to use Wago is crucial to sounding fluent and natural in your Japanese communication. 

Step 2: Learn the basics of Wago - numbers 1 to 5

The first step in mastering Wago counting is learning the native Japanese numbers from 1 to 5. These are as follows:

1. ひとつ (Hitotsu) - One
2. ふたつ (Futatsu) - Two
3. みっつ (Mittsu) - Three
4. よっつ (Yottsu) - Four
5. いつつ (Itsutsu) - Five

It's essential to practice these numbers diligently, as this will provide you with a strong foundation. To become proficient at counting, try to memorize these numbers and practice using them to count small objects around you, such as coins or pieces of fruit.

Step 3: Add numbers 6 through 10

Once you feel confident in your ability to count from 1 to 5 in Wago, let's move on to the next set of numbers - 6 through 10:

6. むっつ (Muttsu) - Six
7. ななつ (Nanatsu) - Seven
8. やっつ (Yattsu) - Eight
9. ここのつ (Kokonotsu) - Nine
10. とう (Tō) - Ten

Similar to the numbers 1 through 5, practice these numerals repetitively, experimenting with counting various objects and using them in simple sentences to solidify your memory.

Step 4: Apply your knowledge - knowing when to use Wago

Understanding when to use Wago is a crucial aspect of mastering native Japanese counting. Generally, Wago is used in everyday conversation and casual settings. Here are some general time when Wago is used:

1. Counting small objects such as marbles, apples, or candies.
2. Expressing the age of a person up to ten years old.
3. Counting animals like birds and fish.
4. Telling time (e.g., one o'clock, two o'clock, etc.)

By understanding when to use Wago, you will gain confidence in your Japanese language skills and sound more natural when conversing with native speakers.

Conclusion

In conclusion, mastering the native Japanese style of counting is an important aspect of learning the Japanese language. Start by building a strong foundation with the basic numbers from 1 to 5, and then progress towards adding numbers 6 through 10. Remember to practice often, immerse yourself in situations where you can apply your knowledge, and always be mindful of when to use Wago in conversation. With dedication and persistence, you will soon have a strong command of Japanese counting and be well on your way to fluency.
