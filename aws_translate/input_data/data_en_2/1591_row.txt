Q: 1,800 fish swim westward, 3,200 swim eastward, and 500 swim north. What is the number of fish left in the sea, if fishers catch 2/5 of the fish that swam eastward and 3/4 of the fish that swam westward?
A: When fishers caught 3 / 4 of the fish that swam westward, their total number reduced by 3 / 4 * 1800 fish = 1350. The total number of fish that remained from the total number that swam eastward is 1800 fish - 1350 fish = 450 fish. If fishers caught 2 / 5 of the fish that swam eastward, their total number reduced by 2 / 5 * 3200 fish = 1280 fish. 3200 fish - 1280 fish = 1920 fish remained in the sea from the number that swam westward. The total number of fish in the sea after fishers caught some is 500 of the number that went north + 450 of the fish that swam westward + 1920 of the fish that swam eastward = 2870 fish. The answer is 2870.

[Question]In the baking contest, three times as many people voted for the unicorn cake compared to the witch cake, and the number of votes for the dragon cake was 25 more than the number of votes for the witch cake. If 7 people voted for the witch cake, how many votes were cast total?
[Answer]First find the number of votes for the unicorn cake: 7 votes * 3 = 21 votes. Then find the number of votes for the dragon cake: 25 votes + 7 votes = 32 votes. Then add the number of votes for each cake to find the total number of votes: 21 votes + 32 votes + 7 votes = 60 votes. The answer is 60.
Q: Joshua bought 25 oranges for $12.50. If he sells each one for 60c, how much profit in cents will he make on each orange?
A: $1 is equivalent to 100 cents so $12.50 is equivalent to 100 * 12.50 = 1250 cents. He bought 25 oranges for 1250 cents so each orange cost 1250 / 25 = 50 cents each. If he sells each orange for 60 cents, he is making a profit of 60 - 50 = 10 cents on each one. The answer is 10.
Question: Walter wants to serve hushpuppies to his guests for his annual fish fry event. He thinks each guest will eat 5 hushpuppies and he is having 20 guests. He can cook 10 hushpuppies in 8 minutes. How long will it take to cook all of the hushpuppies?
Answer: He wants to serve 5 hushpuppies to each guest and he is having 20 guests so that's 5 * 20 = 100 hush puppies. He can only cook 10 hushpuppies at a time and he needs to cook 100 hushpuppies so that's 100 / 10 = 10 batches of hushpuppies. Each batch takes 8 minutes to cook and he has 10 batches to cook so it will take him 8 * 10 = 80 minutes. The answer is 80.
