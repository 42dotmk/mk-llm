If the premise "That may be true, but the connection between the gay awakening and the student rebellion of 1968 is an oblique one" holds, it indicates that despite some potential truth in the relationship between the two events, the connection is not straightforward or easily discernible. This acknowledgment suggests that while the events might be related to a certain extent, their link may not be as direct or transparent as one might initially assume. There may be alternative driving forces and factors that contribute to both events, making the connection more complex than what it appears.

Now, considering the hypothesis "The fact might be true, however, the connection is an oblique one," it can be inferred that this hypothesis aligns with the idea that there may be a true connection between the two events, but that connection is vague, unclear, or not easily understood. Given the premise, we can say that the hypothesis follows logically from the premise, as both propose the concept of an oblique connection between the gay awakening and the student rebellion of 1968.

However, it's crucial to analyze the intricacies of both events to discern how the oblique connection may manifest. The gay awakening refers to the increased awareness, visibility, and activism surrounding the LGBTQ+ community and its fight for equal rights and social acceptance. The student rebellion of 1968, on the other hand, is a series of social and political uprisings that occurred worldwide, driven by young people who demanded various reforms and changes, such as democratization, civil rights, and anti-war movements.

While both events shared some underlying themes of social and political change during the 1960s, their goals, actors, and methods of activism were not always explicitly related to one another. The oblique connection between them can be observed through the broader context of cultural shifts, a broad desire for change, and the fight against oppressive societal structures. These commonalities may serve as bridges that link the two events, albeit in an indirect and obscure manner.

Furthermore, it's important to recognize that the hypothesis doesn't outright deny a connection between the gay awakening and the student rebellion of 1968. Instead, it suggests that understanding the correlation between the two requires more profound insight and contextual knowledge to uncover the shared motives, influences, and goals. This complexity in understanding their relationship is consistent with the primary premise.

In conclusion, if the premise "That may be true, but the connection between the gay awakening and the student rebellion of 1968 is an oblique one" is accepted as true, it supports the hypothesis "The fact might be true, however, the connection is an oblique one." Both the premise and the hypothesis acknowledge the possibility of an existing relationship between these two historical events, albeit seeing their connection as oblique and not easily understood. This nuanced approach accounts for the complexities and diverse factors that contribute to each event and their correlation, reflecting the intricate nature of historical and cultural analysis.
