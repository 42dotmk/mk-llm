[Question]Jenny signs up for dinner theater with 5 of her friends. Each person pays $50 for the ticket and $10 for their entrée, and half the people also buy unlimited drink tickets for $30/person. Then the dinner theater is canceled due to COVID, and each person gets a 90% refund. How much money did the group of six friends lose?
[Answer]First find the cost of the ticket and the entrée for each person: $50 / person + $10 / person = $60 / person. Then multiply that cost by the number of people to find the total cost of entrees and tickets: $60 / person * 6 people = $360. Now find how many people ordered drink tickets: 6 people / 2 = 3 people. Now find the total cost of the drink tickets: 3 people * $30 / person = $90. Now find the total cost of the evening: $90 + $360 = $450. Now multiply this quantity by 90% to find the amount of the refund: $450 * .9 = $405. Now subtract the refund amount from the total cost to find how much money the friends lost: $450 - $405 = $45. The answer is 45.
