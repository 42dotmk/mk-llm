Act 1:
- Tom Logan, having received a letter two months late, learns about the hanging of his long-time friend, Jesse Hayes, in the small town of Braxton.

Act 2:
- Tom learns that Jesse was captured by a mysterious individual called "Braxton," who accused Jesse of stealing his horses and rustling cattle.
- While questioning the townsfolk, Tom finds clues that suggest Braxton controls the town and its people through fear and intimidation, and that everyone is too terrified to talk about Braxton.
- Tom's relentless pursuit of answers lands him in trouble with Braxton's henchmen. After a series of shootouts and close calls, Tom gets information about Braxton's hideout.
- Tom infiltrates Braxton's hideout only to discover Braxton is Jesse's long-lost brother, Randall Hayes, whom everyone thought had died years before.

Act 3:
- Tom confronts Braxton (Randall) about Jesse's execution, and a shocking revelation emerges: Jesse discovered that his brother was alive and leading a life of crime, stealing from the helpless townspeople.
- Unable to face this bitter truth and bear his shame, Jesse decided to end his life, leaving a note in which he admits his apparent crimes and asks Randall to keep his secret, thereby preserving his reputation.
- Upon learning the truth, Tom offers Randall a chance of redemption by helping him cleanse Braxton from the corruption and restore its peace.
- With a heart full of regret, Randall agrees, and the two work together, dismantling the criminal organization that controlled Braxton, eventually retrieving the stolen goods and money, giving them back to the townspeople.
- Randall submits himself to the town sheriff, accepting the consequences of his actions.

Act 4:
- The townspeople gather to witness Randall's trial, where he is found guilty and sentenced to hang. Tom speaks on behalf of Randall, asking for one last chance for him to redeem himself.

- Tom kills the henchman in a quick draw, then watches as Randall dies, finally atoning for his sins.
- The town of Braxton starts to rebuild, its people forever grateful for the justice Tom brought. He pays his final respects to Jesse and Randall's graves and leaves the town, hoping to find peace once more.
