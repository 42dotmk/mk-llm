the older sister, and she wholeheartedly enjoyed taking full advantage of her seniority.

One sunny afternoon, Tanya brought in a freshly baked chocolate cake from the kitchen, setting it down onto the table. The aroma of the warm, velvety cake filled the room, and even though Tanya felt a bit annoyed at the prospect of Elena eating more than her, she couldn't resist the feeling of joy and pride that came from baking such a delightful treat. Elena entered the room with a bright smile, her eyes immediately fixed on the cake. The two sisters sat at the table, eagerly preparing to dig in.

"Remember, I'm older, so I get more cake than you," Elena said with a cheeky grin, as she grabbed the knife to cut herself a generous slice. Tanya's eyes narrowed, but she remained silent. Just this once, she thought, I want to have as much cake as Elena, if not more.

As time went by, Tanya grew increasingly more tired of the cake divide. She might have been the younger sister, but she was also the one who put the most effort into making the cakes. The hours spent perfecting the recipes, decorating them immaculately, and adding that little touch of magic, were all her own.

One day, she had an idea. While she was leafing through a new cookbook, she stumbled upon a recipe for magically transforming cream. The cream, when properly charmed, would grow in quantity whenever someone tried to take away more than their fair share. If Elena tried to take more, the cream would replenish the cake piece for Tanya, ensuring equality in every bite.

Tanya decided to put this magical method of fairness to the test, carefully following the recipe to enchant the cream in the book. She spent hours perfecting her new creation, a beautiful raspberry and vanilla cream cake. She presented the cake at dinner, watching Elena's eyes widen with delight.

As usual, Elena reached for the knife and attempted to cut a larger slice for herself than for her younger sister. However, the moment she attempted to place the disproportionate slice on her own plate, something marvelous happened. The cake piece on Tanya's plate grew to match the size of Elena's. The enchanted cream had worked!

Elena looked at Tanya in shock, then at the cake quizzically. In turn, Tanya couldn't help but smile, knowing she had finally found a way to enjoy her own creations equally.

From that day on, the sisters enjoyed fair shares of cake. Elena, in time, began to appreciate the hard work and love poured into every delicious pastry Tanya baked and understood that her younger sister deserved an equal slice of happiness. This magical cream not only equalized their dessert servings but brought them closer as sisters, teaching them the value of sharing and appreciating one another's efforts.

The enchanted cream's recipe eventually became a family secret, passed down through generations always reminding them that the best moments of life are truly sweeter when they are shared fairly among family and friends. And as for Tanya, she continued to bake the most delightful cakes, using her newfound magic to teach others the importance of kindness, fairness, and a love for the sweeter things in life.
