[Question]Trevor and two of his neighborhood friends go to the toy shop every year to buy toys. Trevor always spends $20 more than his friend Reed on toys, and Reed spends 2 times as much money as their friend Quinn on the toys. If Trevor spends $80 every year to buy his toys, calculate how much money in total the three spend in 4 years.
[Answer]If Trevor spends $20 more than Reed every year to buy toys, Reed spends $80 - $20 = $60. Since Reed uses $60 every year to buy toys, his friend Quinn uses 60 / 2 = $30 every year to buy toys. The total amount of money the three spend in a year together to buy toys is $30 + $60 + $80 = $170. The total amount of money the three will use to buy toys in 4 years is $170 * 4 = $680. The answer is 680.
Q: Lilibeth and her friends go strawberry picking. Lilibeth fills 6 baskets where each basket holds 50 strawberries. If three of Lilibeth's friends pick the same amount as her, how many strawberries do Lilibeth and her friends pick in all?
A: Lilibeth picks 6 x 50 = 300 strawberries. There are 1 + 3 = 4 of them who are picking strawberries. Therefore, they pick a total of 300 x 4 = 1200 strawberries. The answer is 1200.
Question: Andy gets a cavity for every 4 candy canes he eats. He gets 2 candy canes from his parents and 3 candy canes each from 4 teachers. Then he uses his allowance to buy 1/7 as many candy canes as he was given. How many cavities does he get from eating all his candy canes?
Answer: First find how many candy canes Andy gets from his teachers: 3 canes / teacher * 4 teachers = 12 canes. Then add the number of candy canes he gets from his parents: 12 canes + 2 canes = 14 canes. Then divide that number by 7 to find the number of canes he buys: 14 canes / 7 = 2 canes. Then add the number of candy canes he gets from each source to find the total number: 2 canes + 14 canes = 16 canes. Then divide the total number of candy canes by the number of candy canes it takes to get one cavity to find the number of cavities Andy gets: 16 canes / 4 canes / cavity = 4 cavities. The answer is 16.
[Question]Diane is twice as old as her brother, Will. If Will was 4 years old 3 years ago, what will the sum of their ages be in 5 years?
[Answer]Since Will was 4 years old 3 years ago, then he is 4 + 3 = 7 years old now. Dina is twice as old as he is so she is 2 * 7 = 14 years old now. In 5 years, Will will be 7 + 5 = 12 years old. In 5 years, Diane will be 14 + 5 = 19 years old. The sum of their ages at that time will be 12 + 19 = 31 years. The answer is 31.
Q: Isabel loves to run in the forest and she does it within a circuit that is 365 meters long. She runs the circuit 7 times in the morning and runs it 3 times in the afternoon. How many meters does Isabel run during a week?
A: In the morning she runs 7 * 365 = 2555 metres. In the afternoon she runs 3 * 365 = 1095 meters. In one day, afternoon and morning, she runs 2555 + 1095 = 3650 meters. In a week, she runs 7 * 3650 = 25550 meters. The answer is 25550.
