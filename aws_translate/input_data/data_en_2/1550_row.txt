Aksharit is the game that was invented in India and is played more by children compared to Pay Day. To provide a comprehensive understanding, let's delve into the origins, rules, and significance of both games.

Aksharit:

Aksharit is an Indian board game, specifically designed for young children to learn and engage with the Hindi language. The game was developed by IIT Bombay alumni Rajat Dhariwal, Manuj Dhariwal, and Mohit Gupta, and was launched in 2006. Aksharit is often referred to as the Hindi version of Scrabble, as it borrows some of its gameplay aspects from the English word-building game.

In Aksharit, the playing board consists of a grid with cells, and players are given lettered tiles. The aim is to form Hindi words by placing tiles on the board. Each letter tile has a specific point value assigned to it, depending on the frequency of the letter's usage in the language. Players score points based on the letter tiles they use to create words, and bonuses are given when a word is created on special cells (such as double/triple letter scores or double/triple word scores).

The game has been widely embraced in India, particularly among children. Aksharit serves an educational purpose, as it helps kids learn the Hindi alphabet, enhance their vocabulary, and improve their language skills. Moreover, it is crafted in such a way that it caters to both native Hindi speakers and those learning Hindi as a second language, hence making it easily accessible for a more diverse group of players. Its popularity in India is a testament to its successful blend of education and entertainment, making it a favored pastime among young learners.

Pay Day:

On the other hand, Pay Day is an American board game that was created by Paul J. Gruen and first published by Parker Brothers (now a subsidiary of Hasbro) in 1975. Pay Day focuses on teaching children and adults basic financial skills and money management concepts through an engaging, simulation-based gameplay experience.

In Pay Day, players move around a board representing a month, where each space corresponds to a specific day. The goal of the game is to have the most money at the end of the month after accounting for various expenses, deals, and transactions that occur throughout the game. Players receive a monthly salary, assume financial responsibilities, and make decisions aimed at increasing their wealth.

While Pay Day is designed for players of all ages, it is not as widespread in Indian families. The game's content, including its monetary system and financial themes, is centered around the Western way of life, making it less relatable for Indian children. Moreover, given its focus on financial skills, the game is not primarily aimed at teaching or enhancing language skills, making it less pertinent for children in an Indian context.

In conclusion, Aksharit is the game that was invented in India and played more by children, as compared to Pay Day. This can be attributed to Aksharit's relatability to the Indian culture, its educational focus on language learning and vocabulary enrichment, and its accessibility to a diverse group of players, irrespective of their linguistic background.
