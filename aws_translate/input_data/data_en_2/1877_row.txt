Reasoning and answer: Heaven spent 2 * 5 = $10 on sharpeners. She also spent 4 * 5 = $20 on notebooks. Heaven's brother used 10 * 4 = $40 to buy erasers. The total amount of money Heaven and her sister spent on sharpeners, notebooks, and erasers is 40 + 20 + 10 = $70. The total amount of money her brother spent on highlighters is 100 - 70 = $30.
The answer: 30

Twice the number of participants in 2018 is 150 participants x 2 = 300 participants. The number of participants in 2019 was 300 participants + 20 participants = 320 participants. Half the number of participants in 2019 is 320 participants / 2 = 160 participants. The number of participants in 2020 was 160 participants - 40 participants = 120 participants. There were 320 participants - 120 participants = 200 more participants in 2019 than in 2020.
The answer: 200
Reverse engineering the question: In a school, the number of participants in the 2018 Science Quiz Bowl was 150. There were 20 more than twice the number of participants in 2019 as there were in 2018. In 2020, the number of participants was 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019. How many more participants were there in 2019 than in 2020?

Reasoning and answer: First find how thick the blanket will be after 1 folding: 3 inches * 2 = 6 inches. Then find how thick the blanket will be after 2 foldings: 6 inches * 2 = 12 inches. Then find how thick the blanket will be after 3 foldings: 12 inches * 2 = 24 inches. Then find how thick the blanket will be after 4 foldings: 24 inches * 2 = 48 inches.
The answer: 48

Reasoning and answer: Angela has 6 + 3 * 20 = 66 plates. Angela has 1 / 2 * 66 = 33 cutlery. Sharon wants to buy 1 / 2 * 20 = 10 pots. Sharon wants to buy 3 * 66 - 20 = 178 plates. Sharon wants to buy 2 * 33 = 66 cutlery. Sharon wants to buy a total of 10 + 178 + 66 = 254 kitchen supplies.
The answer: 254
