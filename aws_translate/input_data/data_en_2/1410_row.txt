Yes, the sentence "Witness publications strongly discourage followers from questioning doctrine and counsel received from the Governing Body, reasoning that it is to be trusted as part of 'God's organization'." does provide an answer to the question "Why should the counsel received from the Governing Body be trusted?" However, a more detailed and long answer can provide further insight and context.

Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the Governing Body is the representative of God's organization on Earth, also referred to as "the faithful and discreet slave" (Matthew 24:45-47). They are tasked with providing spiritual guidance and direction to the community of Jehovah's Witnesses. The trust in the Governing Body stems from the belief that they are providing doctrine, teachings, and counsel that come from their understanding of the Bible and are guided by Jehovah God.

The sentence highlights the fact that Jehovah's Witnesses are strongly discouraged from questioning the doctrine and counsel they receive from the Governing Body, as they are considered a part of God's organization. This discouragement is based on the premise that questioning the Governing Body's direction is akin to questioning Jehovah himself and can lead to a lack of unity and cohesion among the community of believers.

Moreover, the Governing Body is seen as being under divine guidance, which strengthens the trust that Jehovah's Witnesses place in their direction. They believe that the Governing Body is provided with holy spirit and a deep understanding of the Scriptures, which allows them to be guided by Jehovah to make decisions and provide direction that is in line with his will.

The organization's stance on not questioning the Governing Body also helps maintain unity and order among Jehovah's Witnesses. By encouraging adherence to the Governing Body's directives, the organization aims to promote a united community that is firmly rooted in the teachings of the Bible and aligned in their worship of Jehovah.

It is important to note, however, that trust in the Governing Body can be a controversial topic for individuals who have had different experiences within the organization or who have left the congregation. Critics argue that the discouragement of questioning can lead to a lack of transparency and accountability within the organization. Additionally, some view this level of trust as a form of blind faith that may prevent individuals from critically examining the doctrines and teachings they are given.

In summary, the sentence provided does answer the question "Why should the counsel received from the Governing Body be trusted?" by stating that it is because they are a part of "God's organization." However, it is crucial to understand the context and underlying beliefs that inform this trust, which includes their role as the "faithful and discreet slave," the conviction that they are under divine guidance, and the emphasis on maintaining unity and order among Jehovah's Witnesses. Furthermore, it is important to consider the varying perspectives regarding trust in the Governing Body and the implications of discouraging questioning within the organization.
