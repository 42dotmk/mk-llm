Reasoning and answer: The factory produces 90 + 70 = 160 coolers per hour. The factory works 5 * 9 = 45 hours in 5 days. The factory produces ( 90 + 160) * 45 = 11250 products for 5 days.
The answer: 11250

Sandra had 2 bags that each contained 6 pieces of candy so 2 * 6 = 12 pieces. Roger had 11 pieces of candy in one bag and 3 pieces in the other so 11 + 3 = 14 pieces. Roger had 14 pieces and Sandra had 12 pieces so Roger has 14 - 12 = 2 more pieces of candy.
The answer: 2
Reverse engineering the question: Sandra had 2 different bags of candy. Each of her bags had 6 pieces of candy left. Her brother, Roger, also had 2 bags of candy. One of his bags of candy had 11 pieces left and the other had 3 pieces left. How much more candy did Roger have?

Reasoning and answer: First figure out how much money Marie makes from selling bread each day by multiplying the number of loaves sold by the price per loaf: 40 loaves * $2 / loaf = $80. Next figure out how much money Marie makes from selling cakes each day by multiplying the number of cakes sold by the price per cake: 6 cakes * $12 / cake = $72. Now add the money from selling the bread to the money from selling the cakes to find Marie's total daily income: $80 + $72 = $152. Next subtract Marie's daily expenses from her daily income to find her daily profit: $152 - $20 - $2 = $130. Finally, divide the price of the cash register by Marie's daily profit to find how many days' profits she needs to pay for it: $1040 / $130 = 8.
The answer: 8

Andrea bought 45 / 3 = 15 rhinestones. She found 45 / 5 = 9 rhinestones in her supplies. Thus, Andrea still needs 45 - 15 - 9 = 21 rhinestones.
The answer: 21
Reverse engineering the question: Andrea needs 45 rhinestones to finish an art project. She bought a third of what she needed and found a fifth of what she needed in her supplies. How many rhinestones does she still need?

Reasoning and answer: There are 40 x 25% = 10 students who wear glasses. There are 40 x 40% = 16 students who wear contact lenses. There are 10 + 16 = 26 students who wear vision assistance. There are 40 - 26 = 14 students who do not wear any vision assistance wear.
The answer: 14
