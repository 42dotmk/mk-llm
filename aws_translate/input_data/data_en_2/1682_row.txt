Q: John attends a protest for 4 days. He then attends a second protest for 25% longer than the first. How many days did he spend protesting?

Question: Janet buys 45-pound containers of cat litter for $21 each. If her cat litter box holds 15 pounds of cat litter, and she changes out the litter weekly, how much will it cost, in dollars, for her to buy enough litter to last 210 days?
Answer: If she changes the box weekly, then in 210 days, she will change the box 210 / 7 = 30 times. At 15 pounds of litter for every box change, she will require 30 * 15 = 450 pounds of cat litter in 210 days. If she buys 45 - pound containers, then for 450 pounds she will need to buy 450 / 45 = 10 containers of litter. At $21 per container, to buy enough cat litter for 210 days, it will cost 10 * $21 = $210. The answer is 210.
[Question]Tonya has $150.00 on her credit card. If she leaves any balance on her card at the end of the month, she is charged 20% interest. If she makes a $50.00 payment on her card, what will be the new balance?
[Answer]Her card has a $150.00 balance and she makes a $50.00 payment so the new balance is 150 - 50 = $100.00. She didn't pay it off so she is charged 20% interest on her $100.00 balance so the interest is .20 * 100 = $20.00. Her balance was $100.00 and she was charged $20.00 in interest so her new balance is 100 + 20 = $120.00. The answer is 120.
Q: In a spelling contest held in her school, Drew got 20 questions correct, winning her the competition. She got six questions wrong, and her competitor Carla got 14 questions correct, and twice as many questions wrong as the number of questions Drew got wrong. If each competitor was asked a different question, how many questions were asked in the competition?
A: Since Drew got 20 questions right and 6 wrong, she was asked 20 + 6 = 26 questions. Carla got twice as many questions wrong as Drew got, a total of 2 * 6 = 12 questions wrong. The total number of questions that Carla was asked is 12 + 14 = 26. Altogether, there were 26 + 26 = 52 questions that were asked in the contest. The answer is 52.
