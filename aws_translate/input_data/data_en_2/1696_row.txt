No, "ignore the issue" is not a valid answer to the question "What will Tracy want to do next?" given the context provided. Since Tracy has discovered that her cousin, Austin, is attending an ill-reputed school, she has made the decision to bring him to a good school. Therefore, it is clear that Tracy is concerned about Austin's education and well-being, and wants to take action to improve his situation.

Instead of ignoring the issue, Tracy will likely want to take several steps to ensure a positive outcome for Austin. Here's a detailed and long answer outlining what Tracy might want to do next:

1. Research and identify reputable schools in their area: To help Austin, Tracy will start researching good schools nearby. She might inquire about the curriculum, educational philosophy, faculty qualifications, and extracurricular activities offered. By doing so, she can find a suitable school that provides a healthy and nurturing environment for Austin.

2. Compare and evaluate the options: Having identified several reputable schools, Tracy would then assess and compare them based on criteria important to Austin, such as academic programs, size, location, and tuition fees. Tracy might also consider the needs and preferences of Austin to make sure the selected school suits him well.

3. Discuss the issue with Austin's parents: As Austin is a minor, Tracy should have a conversation with his parents and inform them about the situation. She could discuss her concerns about the ill-reputed school and present the better alternatives she has found. Ensuring they are on board with the idea of changing Austin's school is essential for a smooth process.

4. Visit the potential schools with Austin: Before making a final decision, it would be important for Tracy and Austin to visit the prospective schools together. This would give them a firsthand experience of the schools' environment and facilities, allowing them to make a more informed decision. During these visits, they could also ask questions to understand how the school functions and gauge if it will be a suitable environment for Austin.

5. Apply for admission: Once they've decided on the best school for Austin, the next step would be applying for admission. This might involve submitting an application, providing necessary documents, and going through an interview or testing process. Tracy may provide assistance and guidance to Austin during this process to ensure a successful transition.

6. Support Austin during the transition: Changing schools can be challenging for any student, and it is important that Tracy provides emotional support and reassures Austin during this time. She could help him with any schoolwork, encourage him to participate in extracurricular activities, and offer advice on making new friends.

In summary, instead of ignoring the issue, Tracy will want to take a series of proactive steps to assist her cousin, Austin, in finding a good school and ensuring a successful transition. This includes researching and comparing schools, communicating with Austin's parents, visiting potential schools, guiding Austin through the application process, and providing support during the transition.
