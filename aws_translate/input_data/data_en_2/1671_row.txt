Title: Duke University Backtracks on Call to Prayer Decision Amid Controversy

Duke University, a prestigious private research university located in Durham, North Carolina, has recently experienced controversy after it was revealed the university initially decided to allow a call to prayer from the school's chapel tower. According to a source speaking to CNN, the request for the call came from the university's administration.

However, backlash from various individuals, including prominent evangelist Franklin Graham, saw the university reverse its decision. Graham took to social media to express his disapproval of Duke University's initial support for the call to prayer, urging donors to withhold their financial support from the school unless it revoked its decision.

Graham's post, which quickly gained traction, read: "As Christianity is being excluded from the public square and followers of Islam are raping, butchering, and beheading Christians, Jews, and anyone who doesn't submit to their Sharia Islamic law, Duke is promoting this in the name of religious pluralism. I call on the donors and alumni to withhold their support from Duke until this policy is reversed."

The criticism came not just from Graham, but also from thousands who shared his views on social media platforms. Many expressed concern about the potential implications the call to prayer could have for the historically inclusive nature of the university; others wondered why Duke appeared to be endorsing one specific religious tradition when its establishment was built upon religious tolerance and diversity.

In light of the backlash, Duke University released a statement indicating its change of course, stating: "Duke remains committed to fostering an inclusive, tolerant and welcoming campus for all of its students. However, it was clear that what was conceived as an effort to unify was not having the intended effect."

Omid Safi, a professor and the head of Islamic studies at Duke, spoke on his disappointment in the school's decision to reverse its initial support for the weekly call-to-prayer for Muslim students. He expressed his concern that the controversy surrounding the issue could overshadow the more crucial and constructive conversations that need to be had about interfaith relations on college campuses.

"We need a more nuanced and informed conversation on these important issues," Safi noted. "I am disappointed that the call to prayer controversy has become yet another opportunity for certain sectors to depict Muslims as being 'the other,' who don't quite belong to America," he added.

Duke University's change of course in allowing the Muslim call to prayer provides insight into the continuing unease surrounding interfaith dialogue and inclusion in higher education institutions. While the initial intent of the university was to demonstrate its support for religious plurality, the resulting uproar served to highlight the difficulties in navigating these conversations. With an increased emphasis on inclusivity, universities across the United States and beyond must grapple with how to acknowledge and respect the diverse religious practices among their student populations.
