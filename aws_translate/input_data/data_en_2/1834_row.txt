a collection of posthumous, unfinished manuscripts by martinus from the 1970s until his death in 1981 when he was preparing the first publication of his works under the common title the third testament.

In this collection of posthumous, unfinished manuscripts, the reader can find a treasure trove of wisdom and insights by the renowned Danish spiritual author and philosopher, Martinus Thomsen, more commonly known as Martinus. Spanning over a decade from the 1970s until his death in 1981, these manuscripts showcase the series of works that Martinus had envisioned and planned to publish as a unified body of knowledge under the title, The Third Testament.

The Third Testament was meant to stand as a monumental work that would build upon the ideas and teachings of the Old and New Testaments, adding a modern understanding of spirituality and cosmology to the mix. Martinus, who was deeply inspired by the spiritual awakening he experienced in 1921, used his intuitive and extraordinary insight to probe into the mysteries of life and uncover the principles driving the evolution of the universe and consciousness.

In his writing, Martinus tackled various themes such as love, morality, death, karma, and the purpose of human existence. A writer par excellence, he was well-known for his ability to explain complex and abstract concepts in a language that was accessible and easy to understand for the lay reader. His vision of a world united by spiritual understanding, transcending barriers of religion, race, and nationality, has inspired countless individuals seeking to connect with their inner selves and the divine power that pervades all creation.

The manuscripts in this collection offer a unique opportunity to explore Martinus' groundbreaking thoughts and ideas that were yet to be fully actualized at the time of his death in 1981. As these works were not completed, they may not exhibit the same level of refinement or organization as his published works. However, their raw and unvarnished nature lends them an authenticity and depth that reveal Martinus' innermost thought processes, intellectual struggles, and spiritual breakthroughs in a manner that may not be evident in his polished final works.

For individuals already familiar with the works of Martinus, these manuscripts can be seen as complementary to his other well-known publications, including "Livets Bog" (The Book of Life), "Bisættelse" (Funeral Rites), and "Menneskehedens Skæbne" (The Fate of Mankind). By delving into these unpublished manuscripts, readers can enhance their understanding of Martinus' teachings and further appreciate the profound wisdom that he sought to impart through his life's work.

In conclusion, this trove of posthumous, unfinished manuscripts by Martinus from the 1970s until his death in 1981 offers a remarkable glimpse into the mind of a deeply spiritual individual and philosopher who had devoted his life to unraveling the mysteries of existence. By exploring these works and seeking to understand the ideas presented within them, readers may find new pathways to spiritual understanding, personal growth, and ultimately, the divine essence within themselves and the universe at large.
