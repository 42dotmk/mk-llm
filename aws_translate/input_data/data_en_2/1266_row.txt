Q: Each frog needs to eat 30 flies per day to live. Each fish needs to eat 8 frogs per day to live. Each gharial needs to eat 15 fish a day to live. How many flies get eaten every day in this swamp if it has 9 gharials?
A: First find the number of fish the gharials need to eat: 9 gharials * 15 fish / gharial = 135 fish. Then find the number of frogs by multiplying that quantity by the number of frogs per fish: 135 fish * 8 frogs / fish = 1080 frogs. Then multiply the number of frogs by the number of flies each frog eats to find the number of flies: 1080 frogs * 30 flies / frog = 32,400. The answer is 32400.
Question: Charlotte is making a pie. She can't decide if she will make cherry or blueberry. So she decides to make whichever pie is cheapest. Both pies will need $2 for flour, $1 for sugar and $1.5 for eggs and butter to make the crust. The blueberry pie needs 3 pounds of blueberries. The blueberries come in 8 oz containers for $2.25. For the cherry pie, she needs 4 pounds and they come in a four-pound bag for $14. What is the total price to make the cheapest pie?
Answer: The crust will cost $4.5 because 2 + 1 + 1.5 = 4.5. She will need 6 containers for blueberries because 3 x (8 / 16) = 6. The blueberries will cost $13.5 because 6 x 2.25 = 13.5. The blueberries are cheaper because 13.5 < 14. The blueberry pie will cost $18 to make because 4.5 + 13.5 = 18. The answer is 18.
[Question]Sophie's aunt gave her $260 to spend on clothes at the mall. She bought 2 shirts that cost $18.50 each and a pair of trousers that cost $63. She then decides to purchase 4 more articles of clothing with her remaining budget. How much money would each item cost if she split the cost of each item evenly?
[Answer]Sophie spent $18.50 ร 2 = $37 on the two shirts. She spent in total $37 + $63 = $100 on clothes so far. She has $260 - $100 = $160 left to spend on clothes. Sophie has $160 รท 4 = $40 left to spend on each additional item of clothing. The answer is 40.
Q: The average speed for an hour drive is 66 miles per hour. If Felix wanted to drive twice as fast for 4 hours, how many miles will he cover?
A: If Felix drives twice as fast, he will be covering 2 * 66 = 132 miles per hour. In four hours, driving at 132 miles per hour, since distance = speed * time, Felix will cover 132 * 4 = 528 miles. The answer is 528.
Question: Penelope has 5 M&M candies for every 3 Starbursts candies. If she has 25 M&M candies, how many Starbursts candies does she have?
Answer: Let 5 M&M candies and 3 Starbursts candies be referred to as the unit amounts of each candy. 5 M&M candies make one unit so 25 makes 25 / 5 = 5 units of M&M candies. For every unit of 5 M&M candies, there is a corresponding unit of 3 Starbursts candies so for 5 units of M&M, she has 5 units of 3 Starbursts candies which is = 5 * 3 = 15 Starbursts candies. The answer is 15.
