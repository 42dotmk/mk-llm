Question: A teacher asked Adelaide, Ephraim, and Kolton to buy ducks and monitor their growth patterns and features for their science class. Adelaide bought twice the number of ducks that Ephraim bought, while Ephraim bought 45 fewer ducks than Kolton. If Adelaide bought 30 ducks, what's the average number of ducks the three bought?
Answer: If Adelaide bought 30 ducks, Ephraim bought 30 ducks / 2 = 15 ducks. Since Ephraim bought 45 fewer ducks than Kolton, Kolton bought 45 ducks + 15 ducks = 60 ducks. The total number of ducks the three bought is 60 ducks + 15 ducks + 30 ducks = 105 ducks. The average number of ducks each bought is 105 ducks / 3 people = 35 ducks / person. The answer is 35.
[Question]Jackie's favorite cosmetic company was offering free shipping when you spent $50.00. Jackie ordered her favorite shampoo and conditioner that each cost $10.00 a bottle and 3 bottles of lotion that cost $6.00 each. How much more money does Jackie need to spend to be eligible for free shipping?
[Answer]The shampoo and conditioner cost $10 each so 2 * $10 = $20.00. 3 bottles of lotion cost $6.00 each so 3 * $6 = $18.00. So far she has spent $20 + $18 = $38.00. You need to spend $50.00 for free shipping and she has spent $38.00 already so she needs to buy $50 - $38 = $12.00 more in products. The answer is 12.
Q: Rylee is bored and decides to count the number of leaves falling off the tree in her backyard. 7 leaves fall in the first hour. For the second and third hour, the leaves fall at a rate of 4 per hour. What is the average number of leaves which fell per hour?
A: 7 leaves fell in the first hour. 4 leaves fell in the second hour. 4 leaves fell in the third hour. The total number of leaves that fell during the 3 hours is 7 + 4 + 4 = 15 leaves. The average number of leaves that fell per hour is 15 leaves / 3 hours = 5 leaves per hour. The answer is 5.
Question: Addilynn went to the grocery store and bought six dozen eggs for use in her house. After two weeks, she used half of the eggs, then accidentally broke 15 of the remaining eggs while moving them to clean the shelves. How many eggs are left on the shelf?
Answer: Since a dozen has 12 eggs, the total number of eggs that Addilynn bought is 6 dozen * 12 eggs / dozen = 72 eggs. If she used half of the eggs, the number of eggs left is 72 eggs / 2 = 36 eggs. While moving the eggs to clean the shelves, she broke 15 eggs, leaving 36 eggs - 15 eggs = 21 eggs. The answer is 21.
