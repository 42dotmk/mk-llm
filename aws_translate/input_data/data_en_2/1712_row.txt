Question: Bill put his french fries in the oven after it finished heating. The recommended time was 5 minutes for them to be fully cooked. He put them in for 45 seconds. How many seconds remained?
Answer: Each minute last 60 seconds, so that means for the fries to be fully cooked Bill needs to cook them for 5 * 60 = 300 seconds. Since Bill had the fries in the oven for 45 seconds so far, that means they need to stay in the oven for another 300 - 45 = 255 seconds. The answer is 255.

Q: A club with 30 members ordered fruit juices. Two-fifths of them ordered lemon juice. One-third of the remaining members ordered mango juice, and the rest ordered orange juice. How many members ordered orange juice?
A: 30 x 2 / 5 = 12 members ordered lemon juice. So, 30 - 12 = 18 members did not order lemon juice. Since 1 / 3 of the remaining ordered mango juice, then 18 x 2 / 3 = 12 members ordered mango juice. Therefore, 18 - 12 = 6 members ordered orange juice. The answer is 6.
Question: Chastity made 12 angel food cakes to give to friends. She placed the cakes in boxes, and then walked them out to her car. But she had forgotten her keys. So, she placed the boxes of cakes in one stack on the hood of her car, and then she ran back into the house to get her keys. But before she returned, a black crow came, landed on the stack of cakes, and knocked over half of the stack. When Chastity returned, she picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, but the rest of the cakes were destroyed. How many cakes were destroyed?
Answer: There were 12 / 2 = 6 fallen cakes. Half of 6 fallen cakes were destroyed, for a total of 6 / 2 = 3 cakes. The answer is 3.
[Question]In a compound, the number of cats is 20% less than the number of dogs. There are also twice as many frogs as the number of dogs in the compound. Calculate the total number of animals present in the compound if there are 160 frogs.
[Answer]There are twice as many frogs as dogs in the compound, meaning there are 160 / 2 = 80 dogs. The total number of frogs and dogs in the compound is 80 + 160 = 240. The number of cats is less than 20% of the number of dogs, which means there are 20 / 100 * 80 = 16 dogs more than the number of cats. Therefore, the number of cats is 80 - 16 = 64 cats. The total number of animals in the compound is 64 cats + 240 dogs and frogs = 304 animals. The answer is 304.
