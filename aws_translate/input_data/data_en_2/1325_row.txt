Q: If Katherine has 4 apples and 3 times as many pears in her fridge, how many bananas does she have if she has a total of 21 pieces of fruit?
A: Katherine has a total of 3 * 4 apples = 12 pears. She therefore had 4 apples + 12 pears = 16 apples and pears. We know she has 21 total pieces of fruit, so this means she must have 21 total - 16 = 5 bananas. The answer is 5.
Question: Erika and her 3 siblings are drawing with chalk outside. Another 3 friends join them and ask if they can help with the drawing. Erika loses 2 pieces of chalk as they are counting and the group realizes there isn't enough chalk for everyone. Erika’s mom brings out another 12 pieces of chalk for them to share and there is now enough chalk for everyone to have 3 pieces each. How many pieces of chalk did Erika and her siblings originally have?
Answer: Altogether, there are 1 Erika + 3 siblings + 3 friends = 7 people drawing outside. The group has a total of 7 people * 3 pieces of chalk each = 21 pieces of chalk altogether. Before Erika’s mom helped, they had 21 total pieces of chalk - 12 pieces of chalk Erika’s mom brought = 9 pieces of chalk. Then adding the chalk that Erika lost shows that the group originally had 9 pieces of chalk + 2 lost pieces of chalk = 11 pieces of chalk. The answer is 11.
[Question]During a unit on probability, a teacher surveys her class asking her students two questions. The first question was whether they prefer dogs or cats, and the second question was whether they movies or video games. Of the 30 students in her class, 50% chose dogs and video games as their two answers, while 10% chose dogs and movies as their two answers. In total, how many students in this teacher's class prefer dogs over cats?
[Answer]The 50% of the class that chose dogs and video games amounts to 30 * 0.5 = 15 students who prefer dogs over cats. Similarly, the 10% that chose dogs and movies amount to 30 * 0.1 = 3 students who prefer dogs over cats. Because these are the only two ways that a student could indicate their preference for dogs, and because these groups do not overlap, a total of 15 + 3 = 18 students favor dogs over cats in this teacher's class. The answer is 18.
