Question: Zach baked cookies for a bake sale. On Monday he baked 32 cookies. On Tuesday he ran out of sugar and could only bake half of the number of cookies he baked the day before. On Wednesday he baked three times the number of cookies he did on Tuesday, but his brother ate 4 of those cookies. How many cookies did he have at the end of the three days?
Answer: On Tuesday he made 32 / 2 = 16 cookies. On Wednesday he made 16 * 3 = 48 cookies. Before his brother ate some he had 32 + 16 + 48 = 96 cookies. After his brother ate some he had 96 - 4 = 92 cookies. The answer is 92.

Question: A group of people contains men, women, and children. The number of men is twice the number of women, and the number of women is 3 times the number of children. If the number of children is 30, how many people does this group contain?
Answer: The number of women in the group is 3 women / child * 30 children = 90 women. The number of men in the group is 2 men / woman * 90 women = 180 men. The total number of people in the group is 180 men + 90 women + 30 children = 300 people. The answer is 300.
[Question]In a store, there are three types of cheese: white, swiss, and blue cheese. Each cheese is packaged, and there are 200 grams of cheese in each package. The package prices are $5 for white cheese, $6 for swiss cheese, and $8 for blue cheese. Miley needed to get some for her party, and she decided to buy 5 packs of swiss cheese, 600 grams of blue cheese, and one-third less white cheese. How much did she need to pay for all the cheese?
[Answer]For the swiss cheese, Miley paid 5 * 6 = $30. 600 grams of blue cheese means 600 / 200 = 3 packages. So for the blue cheese, Miley paid 3 * 8 = $24. One - third of the blue cheese means 1 / 3 * 600 = 200 grams. So Miley bought only 600 - 200 = 400 grams of white cheese. Which means 400 / 200 = 2 packages. So for the white cheese, Miley paid 2 * 5 = $10. So in total for all the cheese, Miley paid 30 + 24 + 10 = $64. The answer is 64.
