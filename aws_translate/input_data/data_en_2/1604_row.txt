Q: They say the first year of a dog's life equals 15 human years. The second year of a dog's life equals 9 human years and after that, every year of a dog's life equals 5 human years. According to this logic, how many human years has my 10-year-old dog lived?
A: If your dog is 10 years old then in his first year of life he lived 1 * 15 = 15 human years. In his second year of life, he lived 1 * 9 = 9 human years. We need to calculate his remaining years or 10 - 2 = 8 years of dog life into human years. If 1 year of dog life after the 2 years equates to 5 human years, then 8 years of dog life equals 8 * 5 = 40 human years. In total, your dog has lived 15 + 9 + 40 = 64 human years. The answer is 64.
Question: The moon has a surface area that is 1/5 that of Earth. The surface area of the Earth is 200 square acres. The land on the moon is worth 6 times that of the land on the Earth. If the total value of all the land on the earth is 80 billion dollars, what is the total value in billions of all the land on the moon?
Answer: If the moon land had the same value as earth land it would be worth 16 billion because 80 / 5 = 16. The moon's total land value is 96 billion because 16 x 6 = 96. The answer is 96.

Question: Joseph has a refrigerator, a water heater in his house, and an electric oven that consumes power at different rates. The total amount of money that Joseph pays for the energy used by the refrigerator is three times the amount he pays for the power used by the water heater. If the electric oven uses power worth $500 in a month, twice what Joseph pays for the power the water heater uses, calculate the total amount he pays for the power used by these gadgets.
Answer: If the electric oven uses power worth $500 in a month, twice what Joseph pays for the power the water heater uses, Joseph pays 1 / 2 * $500 = $250 for power used by the water heater. The total amount of money that Joseph pays for the power used by the water heater and the electric oven is $250 + $500 = $750. The total amount of money that Joseph pays for the energy used by the refrigerator is three times the amount he pays for the power used by the water heater, a total of 3 * $250 = $750. For the three gadgets, Joseph pays $750 + $750 = $1500 for the power they use. The answer is 1500.
