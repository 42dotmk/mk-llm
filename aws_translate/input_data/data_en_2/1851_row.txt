The process you described outlines the basic steps of digestion. Ingested food and water enter the body through the mouth and pass through the gastrointestinal tract, where they are broken down into essential nutrients. Eventually, these nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream and distributed throughout the body, with the pancreas playing an essential role in breaking down carbohydrates and aiding the digestion of other foods and liquids. The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned is related to the consumption of less chewed up wax, which we can consider as larger pieces of poorly chewed food. The question is whether this would affect the pancreas to work less efficiently or "softer."

To answer this question, let's go over the primary functions of the pancreas in the digestive process. The pancreas serves two main roles:

1. Exocrine function: The pancreas secretes digestive enzymes and a bicarbonate-rich fluid into the duodenum of the small intestine. These enzymes help in breaking down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Examples of these enzymes are amylase, trypsin, and lipase, which break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, respectively.

2. Endocrine function: The pancreas produces hormones like insulin and glucagon, which help regulate blood sugar levels. Insulin lowers blood sugar levels, while glucagon raises them. Balancing blood sugar levels is crucial to maintaining overall health and energy levels.

Now, let's consider the supposed perturbation of consuming less chewed up wax, or larger food particles, and its impact on the pancreas:

1. In the case of consuming poorly chewed or larger food particles, the stomach has to work harder to break them down into smaller pieces through churning and the action of hydrochloric acid and other gastric juices. Consequently, this might slow down the overall digestion process. However, the pancreas would still secrete its digestive enzymes into the small intestine to break down these larger food particles. The pancreas might not work "softer," but the gastric step in the digestion process could take longer to prepare the food for pancreatic enzyme action.

2. The endocrine function of the pancreas remains largely unaffected by the size of food particles. The production of insulin and glucagon is influenced mainly by the concentration of sugars (glucose) in the blood, which results from the complete breakdown and absorption of carbohydrates. Therefore, even if the digestion process is slower due to the less chewed up wax, the pancreas's endocrine function would still operate in response to the blood sugar levels.

In conclusion, the perturbation of consuming less chewed up wax or larger food particles might slow down the digestion process, particularly in the stomach, before the pancreatic enzymes are engaged. However, it might not necessarily make the pancreas work "softer" or less efficiently, as the pancreas would still secrete the necessary enzymes and hormones to break down nutrients and regulate blood sugar levels. The overall impact of this perturbation would be a slower digestion process before the pancreatic enzymes come into play and still maintaining a counterbalancing endocrine function.
