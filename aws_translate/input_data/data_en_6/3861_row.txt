[b]. Justin must be the person teaching.

The sun illuminated the classroom through large windows as the students waited for their much-anticipated ukulele lesson. Justin, a well-experienced musician, had been teaching an extracurricular music course at St. Andrew's Academy for the past three years. He had a natural gift for connecting with students and was known for his ability to simplify complicated concepts in a fun and engaging manner.

Matthew, a quiet and introverted student with a deep love for music, had eagerly signed up for Justin's ukulele course. He had invariably been captivated by the pleasing strums of a ukulele. Listening to the tiny guitar-like instrument somehow transported him to an entirely different world with its beautiful harmony of sounds.

As the lesson began, Justin picked up his ukulele and started by explaining the basics: how to hold the instrument, proper finger placement, and tuning techniques. Matthew watched and listened intently, absorbing every detail.

Justin then moved on to demonstrate various chord progressions using soothing, well-known songs as examples. Matthew, in awe of Justin's command of the instrument, had a hard time believing that he could ever achieve the same level of proficiency as his teacher, let alone excel in the art himself.

"Okay, now it's your turn," Justin said to Matthew, handing over the instrument with a comforting smile. "I want you to try strumming a C major chord."

Matthew cautiously took the ukulele from his teacher. The student's hands felt slightly shaky, betraying the young musician's nervousness. As he attempted to press his fingers to form the chord, Justin noticed this unease and shared a few calming words of encouragement.

"Don't worry, Matthew. You'll get the hang of this in no time," he reassured, placing a hand gently on the student's shoulder.

With renewed courage, Matthew tried again and miraculously produced a sweet, melodic sound. He looked up at Justin, eyes shining with excitement and gratitude. The two spent the rest of the lesson working on different chord progressions, and Matthew began to grow more confident in his abilities, thanks to Justin's patient guidance.

Over the semester, Matthew's dedication, combined with Justin's expertise, bore fruit in the form of significant improvement in the student's ukulele skills. Not only did Matthew learn to play a variety of chords and songs, but he also began understanding the subtleties of music theory, something that elevated his knowledge to a whole new level.

It was during their final lesson together when Justin decided to surprise Matthew. Handing him a piece of paper, he asked him to read aloud its contents.

"Your hard work and passion have paid off, Matthew. I'm proud to announce that you have been selected as the ukulele player for our upcoming school concert!"

Matthew's face lit up with a mixture of shock and joy. He had never imagined that he would end up on stage as a performer, especially given his timid and introspective nature.

At the concert, Matthew's performance was met with roaring applause. It was evident to everyone present that this newfound talent of his was no mere fluke. Most importantly, his success served as a testament to the power of having an exceptional teacher like Justin, who instilled confidence, knowledge, and passion into his students.
