While your two questions are related, they are not inquiring about the same information. The first question is about the feasibility of successfully executing a bank robbery in 2016, whereas the second question is about the number of unsolved bank robberies on an annual basis. Here, the focus is on analyzing the possibilities and data related to bank robberies. 

First, let's address the question of whether it is possible to get away with a successful bank robbery in 2016. Robbing a bank was never an easy task, but it has become even more challenging over time due to advancements in security measures, surveillance technology, and law enforcement capabilities. Although itâ€™s not impossible, the likelihood of successfully executing a bank heist in 2016 is diminished compared to previous decades. Some reasons for the increased difficulty include:

1. Enhanced Security Measures: Banks have adopted advanced security measures such as biometric access control, bulletproof glass walls, and panic buttons for employees to quickly alert authorities. These measures make it difficult for robbers to access the bank vaults or exit the bank after the robbery. 

2. Improved Surveillance Technology: In addition to security cameras, banks also employ advanced monitoring systems, such as facial recognition software and silent alarms, which can quickly notify authorities about a bank robbery in progress. Furthermore, GPS tracking devices hidden in stolen cash have helped law enforcement locate and apprehend criminals swiftly. 

3. Law Enforcement Capabilities: Police departments have become more efficient at catching criminals due to the implementation of specialized response units and the utilization of intelligence-led policing. Law enforcement officers share databases and cooperate across local, state, and federal levels to identify and apprehend suspects.

Despite these challenges, some bank robbers may still succeed in their attempts. However, it is important to recognize that approximately 90% of all bank robbers worldwide ultimately get caught, particularly in countries with well-funded and advanced law enforcement and security infrastructure.

Now, let's tackle the second question regarding the number of unsolved bank robberies each year. It is difficult to provide an exact figure for this statistic for several reasons. First, data on unsolved bank robberies may not be consistently recorded and reported across jurisdictions. Second, what constitutes a "solved" bank robbery may also vary depending on jurisdiction and law enforcement agency criteria. 

However, according to the FBI, in 2016, there were 4,251 reported bank robberies in the United States. Of those, approximately 1,000 cases, or about 23.5%, remained unsolved. Worldwide, the percentage of unsolved bank robberies may be higher, especially in countries with underfunded or ill-equipped law enforcement agencies. However, the precise figures remain uncertain.

In conclusion, while the two questions you posed are related, they inquire about different aspects of bank robberies. Although successfully robbing a bank in 2016 is challenging, some incidents go unsolved each year. The advancements in bank security measures, surveillance technology, and law enforcement capabilities have contributed to the successful apprehension and conviction of a majority of bank robbers.
