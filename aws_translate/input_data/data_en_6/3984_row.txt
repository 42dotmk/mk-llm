Genre: Mystery/Thriller/Fantasy

Plot Summary:
The quiet town of Glenbrook is steeped in old legends of mysterious, beastly creatures that are known to reside in the dense surrounding forest. For years, these tales have been perceived by the townspeople as mere folklore, until one day when the lifeless body of Charlie, a well-respected philanthropist, is discovered with bizarre markings on his body. Faced with the impossibility of these ancient creatures wreaking havoc, Detective Jamie Williams is brought in to investigate the case and discover the truth behind Charlie's killer.

Act I:
The movie begins with the townspeople of Glenbrook speculating and gossiping about the mysterious death of Charlie Davidson, a popular and influential local philanthropist. The grisly discovery of the murder resurfaces age-old tales about "The Beasts," which were believed to have been banished from the town.

Detective Jamie Williams, a cynical and relentless investigator specializing in cold cases, arrives from out of town to scrutinize the homicide. As Jamie begins his investigation, he crosses paths with Dr. Sara Finch, a local historian, and Professor Samuel Turner, an expert on Glenbrook's beastly legends.

Act II:
Sensing that the locals are holding back on what they know, Jamie, Sara, and Samuel delve deeper into the town's history and the myth of "The Beasts" – discovering that the ancient cursed creatures were rumored to return to Glenbrook every 100 years to reap vengeance upon humans who defiled their once sacred land.

As the hundred-year mark approaches, more townspeople are found dead with similar unexplainable markings, causing paranoia and fear to grip the town. Alongside Sara and Samuel, Jamie hastens his efforts to find the link between Charlie's death and The Beasts. But as he digs deeper, he uncovers hidden secrets about Charlie's seemingly benevolent philanthropic activities – uncovering ties with the town's most powerful figures.

Act III:
As the day of the hundred-year curse approaches, the trio ultimately uncovers a secret myth: The Beasts can only be summoned when there is a betrayal amongst humans. Charlie's philanthropic empire was built on deceit and manipulation revealed to have defiled the sacred land the Beasts had once protected. A showdown between Jamie, the town's powerful elites, and the emerging beasts ensues. 

Sacrificing his life, Detective Jamie Williams fights off the beasts and uncovers the final piece of the puzzle – revealing that Charlie was murdered by his own associates to trigger the curse and cover their tracks. Just as the beasts are about to take their final revenge, Jamie makes a pact with them to cleanse the town of its corrupt rulers in exchange for sparing the innocent townspeople.

Epilogue:
In the aftermath of the battle, Glenbrook rebuilds with a newfound respect for the legend of The Beasts.
