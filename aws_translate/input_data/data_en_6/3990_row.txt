B. Elena gave her a prescription to help control it. 

After carefully examining Patricia's inflamed skin, listening to her recount each symptom, and charting the seasonal onset of the condition, Dr. Elena Ortega, a seasoned dermatologist with over fifteen years of experience, decided that a prescription medicine seemed to be the most appropriate course of treatment. As she reached aside to her modern computer and began typing, Dr. Ortega explained the choice she had made.

"You're experiencing a fairly severe flare-up of eczema," she said to Patricia, her fingers flowing over the keyboard. "This is not unusual when winter comes. Lower temperatures, less moisture in the air, the shift from heated indoor spaces to the cold outside – it all can make the symptoms worse. A prescription cream can help manage the outbreak by reducing inflammation, easing the itchiness, and hydrating the skin."

She finalized the prescription and handed Patricia a printout, explaining each detail: a topical steroid cream for immediate relief of symptoms, an emollient to provide long-lasting moisturization, as well as an oral antihistamine to control the itch. 

"The steroid cream should reduce the inflammation and alleviate the redness and itching, applying it twice daily should start showing results in no more than a week." Dr. Ortega explained, pointing to the first item on the printout. "The emollient, on the other hand, should be applied generously and often. It will lock moisture into your skin and prevent it from drying and chafing."

As for the final item, the antihistamine, Dr. Ortega told Patricia to take it at night. "It will help curb the itching especially during the night and also aid your sleep which can be disturbed due to intense itching. The only side effect is that it might make you a bit drowsy, so better to consume it before bedtime."

As if sensing Patricia's concern, Dr. Ortega quickly reassured her that these medications were generally safe for use but like any medicines, they should be used responsibly. She advised Patricia to apply the creams as directed, not more or less, and to contact her if any side effects were noticed.

Before she let Patricia go, Dr. Ortega also gave her some additional advice to manage her eczema-prone skin during winter. She suggested using humidifiers at home, taking short lukewarm showers, wearing cotton and other soft fabrics as opposed to wool, and avoiding strong soaps and detergents that might irritate her skin. 

Doctor Elena watched as Patricia clutched the prescription in her hands, a sign of hope gleaming on her face. "Remember," Doctor Elena said gently, "managing eczema during winter is about more than medications. It’s about changing your habits and creating a skin-care regimen that works for you. If done correctly and consistently, these efforts should bring noticeable improvement."

Patricia left Dr. Ortega’s office clutching her prescription with newfound hope, comforted by the fact that her eczema was manageable. The winter did not have to be a torment of itching and discomfort. For the first time in a long time, she was looking forward to the winter, ready now to face it with the right medication and skincare regimen. Thanks to Dr. Ortega’s professional guidance and empathetic care, Patricia felt equipped to handle her condition better in the challenging wintertime ahead.
