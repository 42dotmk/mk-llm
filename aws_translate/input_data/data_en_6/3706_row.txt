Q: Bryan starts exercising at home during quarantine. To start, he decides to do 3 sets of 15 push-ups each. Near the end of the third set, he gets tired and does 5 fewer push-ups. How many push-ups did he do in total?
A: In total, Bryan would have done 3 sets * 15 push - ups / set = 45 push - ups. Subtracting the push - ups he didn't do in the third set, Bryan did 45 push - ups - 5 push - ups = 40 push - ups. The answer is 40.
Question: Jason is climbing a telephone pole next to a tree his friend Matt is climbing. Matt can climb 6 feet/minute and Jason can climb 12 feet per minute. After 7 minutes, how much higher will Jason be than Matt?
Answer: First find the distance Matt climbs in 7 minutes: 6 feet / minute * 7 minutes = 42 feet. Then find the distance Jason climbs in 7 minutes: 12 feet / minute * 7 minutes = 84 feet. Then subtract the distance Matt climbs from the distance Jason climbs to find the difference: 84 feet - 42 feet = 42 feet. The answer is 42.

Q: Jackson wants to impress his girlfriend by filling her hot tub with champagne. The hot tub holds 40 gallons of liquid. Each bottle of champagne holds 1 quart. (There are 4 quarts per gallon). If each bottle of champagne costs $50, but Jackson gets a 20% volume discount, how much does he spend on champagne?
A: First find the number of quarts the hot tub holds by multiplying the number of gallons it holds by 4: 40 gallons * 4 quarts / gallon = 160 quarts. Then multiply the number of quarts of champagne Jackson buy by the normal price per bottle to find the cost before the discount: 160 quarts * $50 / quart = $8000. Then multiply that number by 20% to find the amount of the discount: $8000 * .2 = $1600. Finally, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Jackson pays: $8000 - $1600 = $6400. The answer is 6400.
Question: Oliver wonders how much water his bathtub can hold. So he takes a bucket that holds 120 ounces and starts filling the bathtub. When it reaches the top, he sees that he filled it 14 times. Then he wonders how much bathwater he uses, so he starts taking away buckets until it gets to the level he puts it at. He needs to take away 3 buckets to do this. Finally, he wonders how much water he uses in a week for his baths, which he takes every day. How much water does he use each week?
Answer: He uses 11 buckets to fill his bath normally because 14 - 3 = 11. He uses 1, 320 ounces a day for his baths because 11 x 120 = 1,320. He uses 9, 240 ounces a week for his baths because 7 x 1,320 = 9,240. The answer is 9240.
