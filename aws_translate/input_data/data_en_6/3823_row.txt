Following the alignment of the marching band in the street and the individual players performing in different locations, the most logical next event would be for the individual band members to regroup, reassemble, and continue with their coordinated performance. This would involve several steps:

1. Communication: The band director or designated leader informs the separate players that it's time to regroup and return to the main performance area. This can be done verbally, through visual signals, or with the help of technology such as two-way radios and smartphones.

2. Gathering individual players: Each band member stops playing at their designated location and begins moving back towards the main performance area to rejoin the group. If necessary, they will need to carefully navigate through the crowd or any obstacles present in the area.

3. Reassembly: As the individual players approach the main performance area, they start to align themselves following the previously determined formation. This may involve rows, arcs, or various geometric patterns, with each instrument section being strategically placed to produce the best possible sound.

4. Designated coordinators: A key role in marching bands is that of "section leaders" who are responsible for controlling and managing particular instrument sections. Section leaders ensure that their members are following the necessary performance protocols and instructions set forth by the band director, as well as providing individualized guidance when needed.

5. Instrument tuning: Once back in their positions, the band members take a brief moment to check their instruments for correct tuning and make necessary adjustments. It is crucial to ensure that the ensemble produces a harmonious sound when playing together.

6. Resuming the performance: With everyone back in place and ready to continue, the band director signals the start of the next musical piece. The band members follow their sheet music or memorized pieces, adjusting their playing to suit the new performance and ensuring that they are in harmony with their fellow musicians.

7. Engaging the audience: Throughout the reassembled performance, the marching band continues to actively engage with the audience. Members may perform visual maneuvers and formations, play popular or recognizable tunes, or even incorporate dance moves and choreography to add to the overall entertainment value.

8. Continuing the parade or moving to subsequent locations: After performing a designated number of pieces, the marching band may need to move on to the next leg of the parade or another performance location. Following the band director's cues, they will march together in their well-practiced formation, perhaps playing a lively marching tune to keep the crowd entertained as they transition to the next destination.

In conclusion, the most logical next event after the marching band's individual performances would be the reassembly of the ensemble, resuming the coordinated performance, and eventually transitioning to the next destination as part of their parade commitments or series of planned performances. This sequence of events would not only ensure a captivating and cohesive performance but also demonstrates the incredible teamwork and discipline required to make a marching band a successful and entertaining spectacle.
