Q: Chad sandwiches 2 crackers with a scoop of peanut butter. He has 5 of these crackers a night before bed. A box of crackers has 4 sleeves with each sleeve holding 28 crackers. How many nights will 5 boxes of crackers last him?
A: Chad uses 2 crackers for each "sandwich" and has 5 sandwiches a night so he eats 2 * 5 = 10 crackers a night. The box has 4 sleeves of crackers and each sleeve has 28 crackers for a total of 4 * 28 = 112 crackers. 1 box has 112 crackers so 5 boxes will have 112 * 5 = 560 crackers. He eats 10 crackers a night and 5 boxes have 560 crackers so they will last him 560 / / 10 = 56 nights. The answer is 56.
Question: Jerome is taking a 150-mile bicycle trip. He wants to ride 12 miles for 12 days. How long will he ride on the 13th day to finish his goal?

[Question]In 6 months Bella and Bob will be celebrating their 4th anniversary. How many months ago did they celebrate their 2nd anniversary?
[Answer]First, we find their current point in time be realizing that 4 years is 4 sets of 12 months, meaning at that anniversary they will have been together 4 * 12 = 48 months. Then, we subtract their 6 month difference, finding they are at 48 - 6 = 42 months into their relationship. Since 2 years would be 2 * 12 = 24 months into the relationship. We take the larger number, 42, and subtract the smaller number, 24 to find the difference in months, meaning it is 42 - 24 = 18 months. The answer is 18.
Q: You can buy 4 apples or 1 watermelon for the same price. You bought 36 fruits evenly split between oranges, apples and watermelons, and the price of 1 orange is $0.50. How much does 1 apple cost if your total bill was $66?
A: If 36 fruits were evenly split between 3 types of fruits, then I bought 36 / 3 = 12 units of each fruit. If 1 orange costs $0.50 then 12 oranges will cost $0.50 * 12 = $6. If my total bill was $66 and I spent $6 on oranges then I spent $66 - $6 = $60 on the other 2 fruit types. Assuming the price of watermelon is W, and knowing that you can buy 4 apples for the same price and that the price of one apple is A, then 1W = 4A. If we know we bought 12 watermelons and 12 apples for $60, then we know that $60 = 12W + 12A. Knowing that 1W = 4A, then we can convert the above to $60 = 12(4A) + 12A. $60 = 48A + 12A. $60 = 60A. Then we know the price of one apple (A) is $60 / 60 = $1. The answer is 1.
Question: Josh had 100 gummy bear candies. He decided to give his 3 siblings 10 candies each. Then he gave half of the remaining candies to his best friend. If he only wants to eat 16 gummy bear candies, how many candies are left to be shared with others?
Answer: Josh gave a total of 3 x 10 = 30 candies to his siblings. He was then left with 100 - 30 = 70 candies. He gave 70 / 2 = 35 candies to his best friend. So he had 70 - 35 = 35 candies left. Since he only wants to eat 16 candies, there are still 35 - 16 = 19 candies left to be shared with others. The answer is 19.
