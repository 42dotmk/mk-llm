Question: Berry wants to make sure he reads an average of 50 pages a day. This week he read 43 pages on Sunday, 65 pages on Monday, and 28 pages on Tuesday. He had a soccer game and fell asleep early on Wednesday so he read nothing. On Thursday he read 70 pages, and on Friday he read 56 pages. How many pages does he have to read on Saturday to reach his goal?
Answer: He has to read 350 pages a week because 7 x 50 = 350. He has read 262 pages because 43 + 65 + 28 + 70 + 56 = 262. He has to read 88 pages on Saturday because 350 - 262 = 88. The answer is 88.
[Question]A portable computer drive has enough kilobytes of storage space to store 2000 photos. Each photo is 1.5 kilobytes in size. How many 200-kilobyte videos can it store if it already has 400 photos on it?
[Answer]The drive has 1.5 * 2000 = 3000 kilobytes of storage space. It already has 1.5 * 400 = 600 kilobytes of storage space taken up. Thus, it has 3000 - 600 = 2400 kilobytes of space left. The portable drive can store 2400 / 200 = 12 200 - kilobyte videos on it with 400 photos. The answer is 12.

Question: A big snowstorm caused a large amount of snow to fall onto Grandpa's farm, and the wind caused the snow to pile up into a drift. But on the second day, it warmed up enough that half of the snowdrift melted. The third day, it snowed again, adding another 6 inches of snow onto the snowdrift. On the fourth day, another 18 inches of snow fell onto the snowdrift. If the snowdrift was 34 inches deep at the end of the fourth day, how deep in inches was the drift at the end of the first day?
Answer: The third and fourth day contributed 6 + 18 = 24 inches to the depth of the snowdrift. Therefore, the size of the snowdrift after half was melted on the second day, but before the snowfall on the third and fourth day, was 34 - 24 = 10 inches. If the size of the drift on the second day, after half of the snow had melted, was 10 inches, then the depth of the original drift created on day 1 was 2 * 10 = 20 inches deep. The answer is 20.
[Question]Pearl wants to order 5 monogrammed Christmas stockings for each of her 5 grandchildren and her own 4 children. The stockings are $20.00 each and currently 10% off. The monogramming will costs $5.00 per stocking. How much will the stockings costs?
[Answer]She has 5 grandchildren 4 children so she needs 5 + 4 = 9 stockings. The stockings are $20.00 each and currently 10% off so that's 20 * .10 = $2.00 off. The stockings are $20.00 with a $2.00 discount so they are each 20 - 2 = $18.00. The stockings are now $18.00 and she needs 9 so that's $162.00. She also wants to monogram each stocking at $5.00 per stocking so that's 9 * 5 = $45.00. The stockings are $162.00 and the monogramming will cost $45.00 so the stockings will cost 162 + 45 = $207.00. The answer is 1035.
