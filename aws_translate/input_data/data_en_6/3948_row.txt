The statement you provided focuses on the events that took place in Russia during the course of World War I, namely the Russian Revolution of 1917 and Russia's exit from the war as a result. While these events are significant, they do not directly answer the question of who started World War I.

The inception of World War I is a complex subject typically attributed to a series of diplomatic failings, militarism, nationalistic fervor, and tangled alliances among the powers in Europe. However, the direct catalyst for the war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by a Bosnian Serb nationalist, Gavrilo Princip, on June 28, 1914, in Sarajevo.

At that time, Bosnia was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but many Bosnians, including Princip, believed that it should be part of Serbia instead. The assassination led Austria-Hungary to declare war on Serbia, suspecting that the Serbian government had a hand in the murder. Russia, due to its ethnic, religious, and political ties with Serbia, then mobilized against Austria-Hungary.

Germany, which was allied with Austria-Hungary through the Dual Alliance, declared war on Russia in response to its mobilization. Germany also declared war on Russia's ally, France. Germany then violated Belgiumâ€™s neutrality to launch an attack on France, leading the United Kingdom - obligated by the 1839 Treaty of London which guaranteed Belgium's neutrality - to declare war on Germany.

Thus, World War I saw a rapid escalation from a regional conflict between Austria-Hungary and Serbia into a full-scale war involving many of the world's major powers due to a web of alliances and treaties. While the actions of several countries contributed to the start of the war, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand is often cited as the immediate trigger.

Meanwhile, your statement refers to events that took place after the war had begun. As the war progressed, it led to intense political and social internal pressure in Russia. The Tsarist government was already facing widespread discontent before the war, but the increasing hardship and loss of life during the war accelerated the onset of revolution.

In March 1917, Tsar Nicholas II was forced to abdicate after widespread protests, marking the end of the Tsarist autocracy in Russia. This event, known as the February Revolution, led to the short-lived Russian Provisional Government. Then in November 1917 (October according to the Julian calendar, which was in use in Russia at the time), the Bolshevik party, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the Provisional Government in what is known as the October Revolution. This led to the eventual formation of the Soviet Union.

Under the new leadership, Russia decided to withdraw from the war due to the enormous internal issues it had to deal with. In December 1917, Russia signed an armistice with the Central Powers, and in March 1918, it signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which ended Russia's involvement in World War I.

In conclusion, the information you provided touches upon important events during the period of World War I, particularly with regard to Russia's role. However, it does not answer the question of who started World War I. That answer lies more in the web of entangled alliances, nationalistic ambitions, and the spark provided by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.
