Q: The sum of the three angles of a triangle equals 250. The left angle is twice the right angle's value, and the right angle is 60 degrees. Find the value of the top angle?
A: Since the left angle is twice the value of the right angle, the left angle is 60 * 2 = 120 degrees. The total value of the left and right angles is 120 + 60 = 180 degrees. Since the sum of the three angles is equal to 250, the other angle has a value of 250 - 180 = 70 degrees. The answer is 70.
Question: Kendra has 4 packs of pens. Tony has 2 packs of pens. There are 3 pens in each pack. If Kendra and Tony decide to keep two pens each and give the remaining pens to their friends one pen per friend, how many friends will they give pens to?
Answer: Kendra has 4 packs x 3 pens / pack = 12 pens. Tony has 2 packs x 3 pens / pack = 6 pens. In total Kendra and Tony have 12 pens + 6 pens = 18 pens. If they each keep 2 pens, they keep 2 x 2 = 4 pens. They will be able to give a pen to 18 pens - 4 pens = 14 of their friends. The answer is 14.
[Question]A party hall has 3 decorative light bulbs; a red light bulb which comes on every 2 seconds, a green one every 3 seconds and a blue one every 4 seconds. If they are put on at the same time, what is the shortest time after which the three bulbs will be on at the same time?
[Answer]The blue light bulb comes on every 2 seconds so it will be on after 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14... seconds (multiples of 2). The red light bulb comes on every 3 seconds so it will be on after 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18... seconds (multiples of 3). The blue light bulb comes on every 4 seconds so it will be on after 4, 8, 12, 16, 20... seconds (multiples of 4). The shortest time after which all three will be on is 12 seconds which is the least common multiple of the set of multiples. The answer is 12.
Q: George's bowling team is one round away from breaking the league record for most points scored in a season. The old record is an average score per player of 287 per round. Each team has 4 players and there are 10 rounds in the season. Through the first 9 rounds, his team has scored a total of 10,440. How many points less than the current league record per game average is the minimum average they need to score, per player, in the final round to tie the league record?
A: The old team per round record is 1,148 because 287 x 4 = 1,148. The team season record is 11,480 because 10 x 1,248 = 11,480. They need 1,040 points in the final round to tie the record because 11,480 - 10,440 = 1,040. They need to average 260 points each because 1,040 / 4 = 260. This is 27 points less than the current record average because 287 - 260 = 27. The answer is 27.
Question: Bob has planted corn in his garden, and it has just started to sprout. A week after planting it, it had grown 2 inches. The next week, its height increased by twice as much as it had the first week. In the third week, it grew 4 times as much as it did the week before. How tall are the corn plants now?
Answer: The second week it grew twice as much as the first week, so 2 * 2 inches = 4 inches. The third week it grew 4 times as much as in the second week, so 4 * 4 inches = 16 inches. In total, it grew 2 inches + 4 inches + 16 inches = 22 inches. The answer is 22.
