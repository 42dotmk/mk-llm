There are a few ways to accomplish the goal of splitting something, depending on the nature of the object and the tools and methods available. First, let's take a look at the choices presented and then discuss some other methods you can apply.

Choice 1: Cut it open

Cutting an object open is an efficient way to split it, especially for soft or flexible materials. For example, slicing bread, scoring a piece of paper for folding, or using scissors to cut fabric. Generally, cutting requires a sharp tool such as a blade or scissors to make a clean incision or slit in the object.

Here are some steps to guide you in cutting an object open:

1. Choose the right tool: A sharp knife, a pair of scissors, a box cutter, or any other cutting tool suited for the object you want to split.
2. Safety first: Ensure you are handling the cutting tool safely. Always point the sharp end away from your body and fingers, and use protective gloves if necessary.
3. Measure and mark: If precision is necessary, measure the object and mark a guideline where you want to cut it. You can also use a ruler or any straight-edged tool for guidance.
4. Begin cutting: Hold the object securely and make a steady, slow, and controlled cut. Apply even pressure as you move the cutting tool along the guideline.
5. Repeat if necessary: Depending on the thickness or toughness of the object, you may need multiple passes or slightly adjusting the cutting tool to achieve a clean split.

Choice 2: Break it in two

Breaking an object in two is an appropriate method for splitting harder, more rigid materials. Sometimes, a simple hand force can be sufficient, such as snapping a pencil in half or breaking a chocolate bar. For more substantial objects, you might need a tool such as a hammer or even specialized equipment like hydraulic splitters for materials like concrete.

Here are some steps to guide you in breaking an object in two:

1. Choose the right tool: Depending on the object, you might use your hands, a hammer, a chisel, a saw, or another breaking tool.
2. Safety first: Wear proper protective gear, such as gloves, goggles, or a face shield, depending on the material you're breaking.
3. Determine the split point: Identify the precise point where you want to split the object. For some materials, you may need to create a score or starter mark to guide the process.
4. Apply pressure or force: Use the breaking tool to hit or apply pressure to the object. Controlled, focused force is essential for a clean break.
5. Check the break: Inspect the object to ensure it split cleanly. If not, repeat the previous step to refine the split or break off any imperfections.

Other methods you can use to split something:

- Peel or pry apart: Some objects can be carefully peeled or pried apart using a thin, flat tool like a knife or a screwdriver.
- Sawing: For thicker, more substantial materials such as wood or metal, you can use a hand or power saw to separate the pieces.
- Chemically dissolving: For specific materials, chemicals such as solvents can dissolve the object's bonding agents, effectively splitting it apart.

In conclusion, the method you choose for splitting an object will depend on the object's nature, the tools available, and your desired outcome. By choosing the appropriate technique and following safety measures, you can split an object effectively and efficiently.
