[Question]Jeremy decides to take Tylenol because of the pain he is experiencing. He decides to take 1000 mg every 6 hours for 2 weeks. How many pills do they take if they are each 500 mg?
[Answer]He takes 1000 / 500 = 2 pills each time. He takes them 24 / 6 = 4 times a day. So he takes 4 * 2 = 8 pills per day. He takes pills for 2 * 7 = 14 days. So he takes 8 * 14 = 112 pills. The answer is 112.

Question: Jerry owes a loan shark $200. The loan shark charges Jerry 10% interest compounded monthly. (This means that every month the loan shark adds Jerry's interest amount to his loan, and the next month Jerry has to pay 10% on the new total). If Jerry doesn't make any payments, how much (in dollars) does the loan shark charge in interest the second month?
Answer: First calculate how much the loan shark charges in interest the first month by multiplying the loan amount by the interest rate: $200 * 10% = $20. Now add the interest amount to the original amount of the loan to find Jerry's new total: $200 + $20 = $220. Now multiply the new total by 10% to find out how much Jerry owes the loan shark in interest the second month: $220 * 10% = $22. The answer is 22.
[Question]For every black & white cookie that Elsa makes, she has to make the batter, bake the cookies for 15 minutes and then allow to cool. She then has to dip the cookies in white icing and allow the icing to harden for 30 minutes. Then she has to re-dip them in chocolate icing and allowed to harden for an additional 30 minutes. If it takes her 2 hours to make the cookies from start to finish, how long does it take to make the dough and cool the cookies before she can start dipping them?
[Answer]It takes 15 minutes to bake, 30 minutes for the white icing to harden and 30 minutes for the chocolate icing to harden so it takes 15 + 30 + 30 = 75 minutes. Every hour has 60 minutes and it takes her 2 hours so it takes 60 * 2 = 120 minutes to make the cookies. It takes 120 minutes to make the cookies from start to finish and she spends 75 minutes baking and hardening icing so it takes her 120 - 75 = 45 minutes to make the batter and cool the cookies. The answer is 45.
Q: Stan makes a playlist for the next time he goes running. He has 10 3-minute songs and 15 2-minute songs on his playlist. His entire run takes 100 minutes. If Stan wants a playlist to cover his entire run, how many more minutes of songs will he need in his playlist?
A: His playlist currently has a playtime of 10 songs * 3 minutes = 30 minutes from 3 - minute songs. It also has a playtime of 15 songs * 2 minutes = 30 minutes from 2 - minute songs. So far, his playlist lasts for 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. He therefore still needs 100 minutes for his run â€“ 60 minutes current playtime = 40 minutes. The answer is 40.
