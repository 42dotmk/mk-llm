Question: Audrey's key lime pie calls for 1/4 cup of key lime juice but she likes to double this amount to make it extra tart. Each key lime yields 1 tablespoon of juice. There are 16 tablespoons in 1 cup. How many key limes does Audrey need?
Answer: Her recipe calls for 1 / 4 cup of juice but she wants to double that so she needs 1 / 4 + 1 / 4 = 1 / 2 cup of lime juice. 16 tablespoons are in 1 cup and she only needs 1 / 2 cup so she needs 16 * .5 = 8 tablespoons of juice. 1 key lime yields 1 tablespoon of juice and she needs 8 tablespoons so she needs 1 * 8 = 8 key limes. The answer is 8.
[Question]At a flea market, Hillary sells handmade crafts for 12 dollars per craft. Today, Hillary sells 3 crafts and is given an extra 7 dollars from an appreciative customer. Later on, Hillary deposits 18 dollars from today's profits into her bank account. How many dollars is Hillary left with after making the deposit?
[Answer]Hillary sells 3 crafts for 12 dollars each, for a total of 3 crafts * $12 / craft = $36. She receives an extra 7 dollars from a customer, increasing the total to $36 + $7 = $43. She then deposits 18 dollars in the bank, leaving her with $43 - $18 = $25. The answer is 25.
Q: Andy harvests all the tomatoes from 18 plants that have 7 tomatoes each. If he dries half the tomatoes and turns a third of the remainder into marinara sauce, how many tomatoes are left?
A: First find the total number of tomatoes harvested: 18 plants * 7 tomatoes / plant = 126 tomatoes. Then divide that number by 2 to find how many tomatoes are left undried: 126 tomatoes / 2 = 63 tomatoes. Then divide that number by 3 to find how many tomatoes are turned into sauce: 63 tomatoes / 3 = 21 tomatoes. Then subtract that number from the number of undried tomatoes to find the remaining number of tomatoes: 63 tomatoes - 21 tomatoes = 42 tomatoes. The answer is 42.
Question: A lot of people have been sick at Gary's workplace, so he's been working a lot of extra shifts to fill in for people. As a result, he's earned some overtime (where every hour after 40 he earns 1.5 times his normal wage.) His paycheck (before taxes are taken out) came out to $696. If Gary normally earns $12 per hour, how many hours did he work that week?
Answer: Gary earned overtime, so he worked at least 40 hours. for which he was paid 40 hours * $12 / hour = $480 at his normal wage. This means that $696 - $480 = $216 was earned at his overtime wage. His overtime wage is 1.5 his normal wage, or $12 * 1.5 = $18 per hour. So Gary worked $216 / $18 per hour = 12 hours' worth of overtime. So in total, Gary worked 40 hours + 12 hours = 52 hours that week. The answer is 52.
[Question]A clothing store sells 20 shirts and 10 pairs of jeans. A shirt costs $10 each and a pair of jeans costs twice as much. How much will the clothing store earn if all shirts and jeans are sold?
[Answer]Twenty shirts amount to $10 x 20 = $200. The cost of each pair of jeans is $10 x 2 = $20. So 10 pairs of jeans amount to $20 x 10 = $200. Therefore, the store will earn $200 + $200 = $400 if all shirts and jeans are sold. The answer is 400.
