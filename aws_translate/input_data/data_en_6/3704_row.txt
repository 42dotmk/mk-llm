Question: The Pareto principle (also known as the 80 / 20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity) states that, for many events, roughly 80 % of the effects come from 20 % of the causes. Management consultant Joseph M. Juran suggested the principle and named it after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who noted the 80 / 20 connection while at the University of Lausanne in 1896, as published in his first paper, "Cours d'Ã©conomie politique". Essentially, Pareto showed that approximately 80 % of the land in Italy was owned by 20 % of the population; Pareto developed the principle by observing that about 20 % of the peapods in his garden contained 80 % of the peas.
