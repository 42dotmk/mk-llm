The claim that Argentina inherited Spain’s claim to sovereignty has its roots in the history of colonialism, international law, and territorial disputes. Numerous evidence support this claim, including historical treaties, the principle of uti possidetis juris, Argentina's post-independence actions, legal precedents, and the international recognition of its sovereignty. Below is a detailed analysis of the supporting evidence:

1. Spanish Colonial Legacy: As a former Spanish colony, Argentina became part of the Spanish Empire, which extended across South America. Spain's territorial acquisitions and its exercise of sovereignty over these lands were based on the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494), the papal bull Inter caetera (1493), and the Treaty of Madrid (1750), among others. These treaties divided the New World between Spain and Portugal and established Spanish sovereignty over most of present-day Argentina.

2. Uti Possidetis Juris Principle: This principle of international law, which originates from Roman law, dictates that newly independent states should retain the borders they had held as colonies. Following the Argentine War of Independence (1810-1818), Argentina became a sovereign and independent state, inheriting Spain's territorial claims in the region. This principle further cemented Argentina's legitimacy as the rightful successor of Spain's claim to sovereignty.

3. Post-Independence Actions: Argentina's actions after achieving independence in 1816 further reinforced its status as the inheritor of Spain's claims. The Argentine government asserted control and authority over the territories that had been part of the Spanish Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, including present-day Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and parts of Bolivia. Additionally, Argentina carried out administrative, political, and military functions in these territories, which further strengthened its sovereignty claims.

4. Legal Precedents: Throughout history, various international legal precedents have reinforced the notion that Argentina inherited Spain's sovereignty claims. For instance, in the Island of Palmas Case (1928) and the Eastern Greenland Case (1933), the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) recognized the principle of effective occupation and control as a key factor in determining sovereignty, which was predominantly based on Argentina's Spanish colonial legacy and its subsequent actions as an independent state.

5. International Recognition: Argentina's claim to sovereignty was also fortified by the international recognition of its status as a sovereign state and its inherited territorial rights. Numerous countries formally recognized Argentina as an independent state and established diplomatic relations as such, supporting its territorial claims. This recognition further strengthened Argentina's claim to having inherited Spain's territorial sovereignty.

In conclusion, evidence such as historical treaties, the principle of uti possidetis juris, Argentina's post-independence actions, legal precedents, and international recognition of its sovereignty, lend substantial support to the claim that Argentina inherited Spain's claim to sovereignty. This inheritance allowed Argentina to establish its territorial boundaries and exercise legitimate authority over its lands as the successor of the Spanish Empire in the region.
