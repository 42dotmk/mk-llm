Question: Drew is reseeding his lawn with grass seed. One bag of grass seed covers 250 square feet of lawn. His lawn is 22 feet from the house to the curb and 36 feet from side to side. He bought four bags of seed. How many extra square feet could the leftover grass seed cover after Drew reseeds his lawn?
Answer: Drew’s lawn is 22 * 36 = 792 square feet. He bought enough grass seed to cover 250 * 4 = 1000 square feet. Thus, the leftover grass seed can cover 1000 - 792 = 208 square feet. The answer is 208.
[Question]Myrtle’s 3 hens lay 3 eggs a day. She would be gone for 7 days and told her neighbor to take as many as they would like. The neighbor took 12 eggs. Once home, Myrtle collected the remaining eggs, dropping 5 on the way into her house. How many eggs does Myrtle have?
[Answer]She has 3 hens that lay 3 eggs a day so they lay 3 * 3 = 9 eggs a day. The hens lay 9 eggs a day and she wasn't able to collect them for 7 days so that means there are 9 * 7 = 63 eggs. Her neighbor took 12 off the 63 eggs so that leaves 63 - 12 = 51 eggs. Myrtle dropped 5 of the remaining 51 eggs so she has 51 - 5 = 46 eggs. The answer is 46.
Q: 40 kids are running a race. 10% of them pass the finish line in less than 6 minutes. Three times that number finish in less than 8 minutes. 1/6 of the remaining kids take more than 14 minutes. How many kids take more than 14 minutes?
A: First find how many kids finish in under 6 minutes: 40 kids * 10% = 4 kids. Then triple that number to find how many finish in less than 8 minutes: 4 kids * 3 = 12 kids. Then subtract those two numbers from the total number of kids to find the number of remaining kids: 40 kids - 4 kids - 12 kids = 24 kids. Then divide that number by 6 to find how many kids take more than 14 minutes: 24 kids / 6 = 4 kids. The answer is 4.
Question: A basketball team won 40 games in their last competition. In the next competition, they won 5/8 times as many games as they won in their first competition. In the third competition, they won the same number of games as the sum of the first and second competition winnings. Calculate the total number of wins they had in the three competitions.
Answer: If they won 40 games in the first competition, they won 5 / 8 * 40 = 25 games in their second season. In the third competition, they won games equal to the sum of the games they won in the last two competitions, which is 25 + 40 = 65 games. Since the total number of games they won in the first two competitions is 65, and they won 65 more in the third competition, they won a total of 65 + 65 = 130 in all competitions. The answer is 130.
