[Question]Norma takes her clothes to the laundry. She leaves 9 T-shirts and twice as many sweaters as T-shirts in the washer. When she returns she finds 3 sweaters and triple the number of T-shirts. How many items are missing?
[Answer]Norma left 9 T - shirts And twice as many sweaters, she took 9 * 2 = 18 sweaters. Adding the T - shirts and sweaters, Norma left 9 + 18 = 27 clothes. When she came back, she found 3 sweaters And triple the number of T - shirts, she found 3 * 3 = 9 T - shirts. Adding the T - shirts and sweaters, Norma found 3 + 9 = 12 clothes. Subtracting the clothes she left from the clothes she found, 27 - 12 = 15 clothes are missing. The answer is 15.
Q: Zilla spent 7% of her monthly earnings on rent, half of it on her other monthly expenses, and put the rest in her savings. If she spent $133 on her rent, how much does she deposit into her savings account in a month?
A: Since $133 is equal to 7% of her earnings, then 1% is equal to $133 / 7 = $19. The total monthly earning of Zilla is represented by 100%, so $19 x 100 = $1900 is her monthly earnings. So, $1900 / 2 = $950 is spent on her other monthly expenses. The total amount spent on the rent and other monthly expenses is $133 + $950 = $1083. Hence, she saves $1900 - $1083 = $817 per month. The answer is 817.
Question: Antonio is preparing a meal of spaghetti and meatballs for his family. His recipe for meatballs calls for 1/8 of a pound of hamburger per meatball. Antonio has 8 family members, including himself. If he uses 4 pounds of hamburger to make meatballs, and each member of the family eats an equal number of meatballs, how many meatballs will Antonio eat?
Answer: If one meatball is made from 1 / 8 pound of hamburger meat, then 4 pounds of hamburger meat will make 4 / (1 / 8) = 4 * 8 = 32 meatballs. 32 meatballs divided amongst 8 family members is 32 / 8 = 4 meatballs per family member. The answer is 4.
[Question]Doris works at the Widget Factory in the packing department. She puts 3 widgets in each carton, which are 4 inches wide, 4 inches long, and 5 inches tall. She then packs those cartons into a shipping box before sending it to the loading bay. The shipping boxes are 20 inches wide, 20 inches long, and 20 inches high. How many widgets get shipped in each shipping box?
[Answer]Each carton has an area of 4 * 4 * 5 = 80 square inches. Each shipping box has an area of 20 * 20 * 20 = 8000 square inches. The total number of cartons that will fit into each box is 8000 / 80 = 100. Since there are 3 widgets in each carton, the total number of cartons in each box will be 3 * 100 = 300. The answer is 300.
Q: Courtney liked to collect marbles. She kept them in mason jars. One jar had 80 marbles. Her second jar had twice that amount. She just started her third jar which currently has 1/4 the amount of her first jar. How many marbles does she have in total?
