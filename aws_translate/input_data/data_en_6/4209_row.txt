(A). Megan was always causing all kinds of trouble.

Megan was a real headache for Elena, because she was always causing all kinds of trouble. Despite being long-time friends, Elena found herself constantly in the line of fire whenever Megan managed to disrupt the peaceful balance of the world around them. It was a frustrating dynamic, one that left Elena questioning the longevity of their friendship.

For instance, there were the numerous times when Megan would convince Elena to tag along for one of her infamous schemes. Some of these misadventures included sneaking into the movies without paying, taking a joyride on a neighbor's motorcycle that they had found unlocked, and even trying to shoplift a dress from a popular clothing store. Elena was always left shaking her head in exasperation whenever they somehow managed to escape getting caught, while Megan would laugh it all off as if it were the most enjoyable thing in the world.

At school, Megan's antics were well-known among students and teachers alike. Her academic performance was lackluster at best, as she barely paid attention in classes, often submitting assignments late or not at all. Megan's cheeky attitude towards authority was the cause of many detentions, most of which Elena was also forced to endure because of her close friendship with Megan. It wasn't unheard of for Elena to be tasked with explaining Megan's actions to the school principal, who was rapidly losing patience with this wayward student.

However, the biggest trouble Megan and Elena faced was when Megan's impulsive behavior started to creep into their personal lives. Relationships were a sore spot for the duo, as Megan's unpredictability and lack of respect for others' feelings often left a string of broken hearts in her wake. Elena, being the ever-loyal friend, was always there to pick up the pieces, consoling those who had fallen afoul of Megan's whimsical approach to love and friendship.

Yet, despite all the headaches that Megan caused, Elena couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration for her friend's unbridled zest for life. There were moments where Megan would display a boundless energy, working towards a goal or dream that, with her intellect if properly applied, seemed entirely achievable. It was during these brief flashes of brilliance that Elena knew she couldn't simply walk away from their friendship. This steadfast belief in Megan ultimately led Elena to continue supporting her, even when the odds seemed insurmountable.

The balance between the frustration of dealing with Megan's trouble-making tendencies and the admiration for her moments of pure potential was precarious. Elena often found herself conflicted, torn between the need to protect her friend and the desire to see Megan grow and mature out of her unhelpful habits. Surely, there had to be a breaking point where everything either came together or fell apart entirely.

And although Elena didn't know when that moment might arrive, she understood that she would have to be prepared for either outcome. For now, all she could do was support her friend, hoping that one day Megan would realize the consequences of her actions and accept the responsibility that came with growing up. Until that day, Elena would shoulder the burden of Megan's troubles, attempting to guide her along a path that would hopefully lead to happier times for them both.
