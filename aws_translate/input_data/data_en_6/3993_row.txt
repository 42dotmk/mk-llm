Reasoning and answer: At the beginning, Jacob had 8 fish. Alex had 7 * 8 = 56 fish. After knocking the bucket over, Alex was left with 56 - 23 = 33 fish left. The final amount caught by Jacob to beat Alex by 1 fish is 33 + 1 = 34 fish. Then Jacob needs to catch 34 - 8 = 26 fish more.
The answer: 26

Question: At a recent fishing tournament, Alex caught 7 times as many fish as Jacob. Jacob did not think that he had any chance of winning, but Alex became overconfident and knocked over his bucket of fish, losing 23 fish back to the lake. If Jacob had 8 fish at the beginning, how many more fish does he need to catch to beat Alex by just 1 fish?

Pastor Paul prays 20 * 6 = 120 days per week, except Sunday. On Sunday, Pastor Paul prays 2 * 20 = 40 times. Per week, Pastor Paul prays 120 + 40 = 160 times. Pastor Bruce prays half as much as Pastor Paul does on all days except Sunday, for a total of 120 / 2 = 60 times. Pastor Bruce prays twice as much on Sundays as does Pastor Paul, or 40 * 2 = 80 times. In total, Pastor Bruce prays 60 + 80 = 140 times per week. Thus, per week, Pastor Paul prays 160 - 140 = 20 more times per week than Pastor Bruce.
The answer: 20
Reverse engineering the question: Pastor Paul prays 20 times per day, except on Sunday, when he prays twice as much. Pastor Bruce prays half as much as Pastor Paul, except on Sundays, when he prays twice as much as Pastor Paul. How many more times does Pastor Paul pray than Pastor Bruce prays in a week?

Reasoning and answer: Cherry earns $2.50 x 4 = $10 after delivering four 5 kilograms of cargo per day. She earns $4 x 2 = $8 after delivering two 8 kilograms of cargo per day. So, her total earning per day is $8 + $10 = $18. Therefore, she will earn $18 x 7 = $126 in a week.
The answer: 126

Question: Cherry put up a delivery service. She charges $2.50 for a 3-5 kilograms cargo and $4 for a 6-8 kilograms cargo. If she delivers four 5 kilograms cargo and two 8 kilograms cargo per day, how much money will she earn in a week?

First, we need to determine the total amount of minutes available for cooking. We do this by performing 2 * 60 = 120, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. Now that we know we have 120 minutes, we then divide the preparation time into the total amount of time by performing 120 / 20 = 6 dishes capable of being made. Since each dish can feed 5 people, we find the total number of people fed by performing 5 * 6 = 30 people.
The answer: 30
Reverse engineering the question: Megan is making food for a party. She has to spend 20 minutes preparing one dish in the oven. Each dish can feed 5 people. She spends 2 hours preparing as many of these dishes as she can for the party. How many people can she feed with these dishes?

Reasoning and answer: Logan spends 20000 + 5000 + 8000 = 33000 a year. Logan has 65000 - 33000 = 32000 left a year. Logan needs to make 42000 - 32000 = 10000 more a year.
The answer: 10000
