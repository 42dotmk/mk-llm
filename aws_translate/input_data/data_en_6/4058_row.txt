Title: Review - "Ad Astra"

When it comes to science fiction cinema, there's a certain standard that audiences have come to expect. Stunning visuals, gripping storyline, significant character development, and above all, some genuine thrill. Unfortunately, James Gray's Ad Astra not only fails to meet those expectations but also descends into an abysmal narrative abyss, rendering it a painful viewing experience. 

Boasting a cast led by Brad Pitt in the role of astronaut Roy McBride, Ad Astra offers a certain promise before unravelling its cloth of disappointment. Pitt delivers a tediously monotonous performance. He certainly tried resurrecting the frozen script with a few sprinkling of emotion, but even the charm of his scintillating blue eyes seemed lost in the zero-gravity vacuum of Space.

The film revolves around the trite and worn-out idea of a son embarking on a journey to save humanity and find his long-lost father. To make it even more predictable, the writers sprinkled in a narrative structure revolving around self-discovery and redemption. The script, supposedly elite by Hollywood standards, is quite pedestrian, drowns in its ambition, and leaves the viewer sorely disappointed.

The film also seems to suffer from an existential crisis, unable to decide whether it is a dense philosophical discourse or a frenzied space adventure. The lifeless dialogue and sleep-inducing soliloquies made it hard to connect with any character on an emotional level. It was like watching the endless expanse of space – cold and unfeeling.

Even the usually reliable Tommy Lee Jones, who played Clifford McBride, Roy's lost father, seems underwhelming. Despite his extended screen-time, his character is neither fully developed nor compelling. Instead, his character’s motivations felt forced and hard to comprehend. 

The narrative consistently hammers in the theme of isolation, which unfortunately expands to the audience's connection with the film. The cinematography is remarkable, with some truly awe-inspiring visuals, but it feels squandered when paralleled with such a lackluster narrative. It’s like standing in front of an exceptionally painted yet utterly meaningless canvas.

Ruth Negga's short role is one of the very few highlights of the film. She shines and delivers an emotionally charged performance in her limited screen time. However, one actor’s shining moments cannot carry an entire movie, and Negga's talents were wasted in an underwritten role and an underwhelming narrative.

Don’t get me wrong; the film did have a handful of thrilling moments. The lunar rover chase sequence was undeniably gripping, and the scenes involving the space creatures were genuinely terrifying. However, these instances were dipped in the chaos of the overstuffed plot and overburdened narrative, truly delineating the saying – too many cooks spoil the broth.

In conclusion, Ad Astra seems more like an ostentatious Hollywood drama in the disguise of a sci-fi movie. It attempts to dive into profound philosophical ruminations but leaves the viewer cold and unaffected, lost and stranded in its emotional void. The imbalance between its breathtaking visuals and a stunted narrative echo an unfortunate disproportion that is impossible to ignore. Ad Astra, striving to reach the stars, falls dishearteningly short, leaving this viewer, at least, utterly unimpressed.
