While it is evident that you loved her deeply and passionately, it does not necessarily follow that "I loved her but that didn't stop you from asking her to marry you." The situation and intentions of both individuals involved in this love triangle must be considered and analyzed in-depth. Let's break down the factors that may influence the decisions and actions of the parties involved.

1. Emotional connection: Love is a complex emotion that can manifest in various forms within different relationships. It is possible that the person asking her to marry him also loved her or had a significant emotional connection with her. Alternatively, they might not have shared the same level of emotional intimacy as you did.

2. Intentions: The reasons for asking her to marry him could differ considerably from the emotions driving your love for her. For instance, the proposal could be fueled by factors such as financial stability, social status, family expectations, or even a desire for companionship. In some cases, individuals might not even acknowledge or realize the depth of their feelings in the situation, leading to a proposal based purely on logical reasons.

3. Relationship dynamics: The nature of the relationships in this love triangle is another crucial element to consider. Were you and her close friends or secret lovers? Were there any obstacles that prevented you from being together, such as long-distance, cultural differences, or social barriers? On the other hand, did the person who asked her to marry him have a long-standing relationship with her? Was their connection based on trust, understanding, and a shared history that made the proposal feel like a natural progression in their partnership?

4. Communication: Effective communication is key to understanding and navigating emotional situations. Did you express your feelings and intentions to her or the person asking her to marry him? If your love was a secret or not fully acknowledged by all parties involved, this could have significantly impacted the resulting actions. The person proposing might be unaware of your feelings for her or the intensity of your relationship, thereby making the assumption that they were not encroaching on another person's emotional territory.

5. Timing: The timing of the proposal and your expression of love can also play a critical role in determining whether both actions can coexist. If you waited too long to convey your feelings or hesitated to take the leap of proposing to her, this delay could have opened the opportunity for someone else to take the initiative. Conversely, if the person asking her to marry him was aware of your feelings and chose to propose regardless, this could signal a disregard for your heartfelt emotions.

In conclusion, while your love for her might have been genuine and intense, it does not necessarily imply that it precluded the person from asking her to marry him. Several factors such as emotional connection, intentions, relationship dynamics, communication, and timing, can influence individual decisions and actions in such intricate situations. It is essential to reflect on these aspects to fully comprehend the choices made by all parties in this love triangle, and understand the ways in which your love for her and the marriage proposal may or may not have been mutually exclusive.
