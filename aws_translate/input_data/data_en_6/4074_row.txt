Title: Michael Clarke Duncan dead at 54: ‘The Green Mile’ actor dies nearly two months after suffering heart attack

Michael Clarke Duncan, an Oscar-nominated actor best known for his role as the gentle giant, John Coffey, in the critically acclaimed movie ‘The Green Mile,’ died Monday at age 54. His publicist Joy Fehily confirmed the tragic news, reporting that Duncan passed away in a Los Angeles hospital, nearly two months after suffering a massive heart attack that left him hospitalized since July 13.

Born in Chicago in 1957, Duncan, who stood at a towering 6 feet 5 inches tall and weighed around 315 pounds, began his Hollywood career with small roles in movies such as Friday, Renaissance Man, and Armageddon. However, it was his breakthrough performance in the 1999 adaptation of Stephen King's ‘The Green Mile’ that catapulted him into stardom. Playing opposite Tom Hanks, Duncan's portrayal of a gentle, miracle-working death row inmate earned him a best supporting actor nomination at the Academy Awards.

Duncan's sudden death has left Hollywood reeling and is a great loss to the acting community. Colleagues, co-stars, and fans have taken to social media and other platforms to express their shock and grief at his passing. Tom Hanks was one of the first to pay tribute to Duncan, saying, "I am terribly saddened at the loss of a Big Mike, a treasure we all adored. He was a man of big love who embraced every moment of every day. He was magic."

Actress and TV host Holly Robinson Peete, who knew Duncan, also expressed her condolences, tweeting: "RIP Michael Clarke Duncan… Devastated. Speechless. Sending rowing prayers for Omarosa & MCD's family." Director Frank Darabont, who directed Duncan in ‘The Green Mile,’ said in a statement, "I'm devastated at the loss of Michael Clarke Duncan, one of the finest people I've ever had the privilege to work with or know. Michael was the gentlest of souls—a big man with an even bigger heart, a devout Christian who loved everyone and had a smile that would light up a room."

Duncan's impressive film career also included the box office hits such as ‘Daredevil,’ ‘Planet of the Apes,’ ‘Sin City,’ and ‘Kung Fu Panda.’ He also lent his deep, resonant voice to various animated projects, including the role of Tug in the movie ‘Brother Bear.’

The actor's journey to success was not an easy one. Prior to his acting career, Duncan worked as a ditch digger, club bouncer, and even a personal bodyguard for celebrities such as Will Smith and Notorious B.I.G. His success story, though sadly short-lived, is a testament to his determination and perseverance in the face of adversity.

Duncan's death has come as a significant blow to the industry, particularly to those who knew him closely. With his incredible talent, resonant voice, and one-of-a-kind presence, the late actor is sure to be remembered by many for his unforgettable performances in his unassuming, genuine, and, at times, dazzling roles.

His fiancée, Omarosa Manigault, who has been by his side throughout this difficult time, expressed her gratitude for the support and well-wishes that she and Duncan's family have received in the wake of his passing.

Ultimately, the loss of Michael Clarke Duncan serves as a poignant reminder of the fragility of life, and his legacy will remain etched in our hearts and on the silver screen. May he rest in peace.
