To make Chocolate Heath Bar Ice Cream Bars at home without an ice cream freezer, you can follow either of the two methods below:

Solution 1: No-Churn Ice Cream Base

Ingredients:
- 2 cups heavy whipping cream
- 1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 4 Heath candy bars, crushed (or substitute with 1 cup toffee bits)
- 2 cups dark or milk chocolate, melted

Instructions:

1. In a large bowl, whip the heavy cream with a hand mixer or stand mixer on high speed until stiff peaks form. This may take about 5 minutes.

2. In another bowl, mix the sweetened condensed milk and vanilla extract.

3. Gently fold the whipped cream into the sweetened condensed milk mixture until fully combined.

4. Stir in the crushed Heath bars or toffee bits.

5. Line a 9x5-inch loaf pan or a similarly-sized container with wax paper or plastic wrap, ensuring that it hangs over the sides.

6. Pour the ice cream mixture into the prepared pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and freeze for at least 6 hours or overnight.

7. When the ice cream is thoroughly frozen, remove it from the pan by lifting the wax paper or plastic wrap.

8. Let the ice cream soften for a few minutes, then cut into bars with a sharp knife.

9. Melt the dark or milk chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl at 30-second intervals until smooth. Let it cool slightly.

10. Dip the ice cream bars into the melted chocolate, coating them evenly. Place them on a wax paper-lined tray.

11. Put the coated ice cream bars back in the freezer for 15-20 minutes to allow the chocolate to set.
