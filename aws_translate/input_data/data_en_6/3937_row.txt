Reasoning and answer: Yesterday before her rock collecting trip, she had 48 - 6 = 42 mineral samples. She has 1 / 2 the number of gemstones, so she has 42 / 2 = 21 gemstone samples.
The answer: 21

Question: Joan collects rocks. In her collection of rock samples, she had half as many gemstones as minerals yesterday. Today, she went on a rock collecting trip and found 6 more mineral samples. If she has 48 minerals now, how many gemstone samples does she have?

First find how much more Jerry charges to pierce one person's ears than their nose: $20 * 50% = $10. Then add that amount to the cost of nose piercing to find the total cost: $10 + $20 = $30. Then multiply that price by the number of ears he pierces to find his total earnings from ear - piercing: $30 / ear * 9 ears = $270. Then multiply the price of nose - piercing by the number of noses pierced: $20 / nose * 6 noses = $120. Then add the money from nose - piercing to the money from ear - piercing to find Jerry's total income: $120 + $270 = $390.
The answer: 390
Reverse engineering the question: Jerry charges $20 to pierce someone's nose and 50% more to pierce their ears. If he pierces 6 noses and 9 ears, how much money does he make?

Reasoning and answer: If Rover has 46 spots, then half as many spots as Rover has is 46 / 2 = 23 spots. If Cisco has 5 less than half as many spots as Rover has, then Cisco has 23 - 5 = 18 spots. If Granger has five times as many spots as Cisco, then Rover has 18 * 5 = 90 spots. Thus, the total combined number of spots that Rover and Cisco have is 90 + 18 = 108 spots.
The answer: 108

Question: Granger has five times as many spots as his brother, Cisco. But Cisco has 5 less than half as many spots as his cousin, Rover. If Rover has 46 spots, how many spots do Granger and Cisco have combined?

For the buns, Frank paid 10 * 0.1 = $1. He bought two bottles of milk, for $2 each, so he paid for them 2 * 2 = $4. One carton of eggs was three times more expensive than one bottle of milk, so it cost 3 * 2 = $6. So for all his shopping Frank had to pay 1 + 4 + 6 = $11.
The answer: 11
Reverse engineering the question: Frank went to a shop to buy some food for his breakfast. He bought 10 buns for $0.1 each, two bottles of milk, for $2 each, and a carton of eggs, which was three times more expensive than one bottle of milk. How much did Frank pay for his breakfast shopping?

Reasoning and answer: 25% of men at the job don't have a college degree because 100 - 75 = 25. There are 32 men at the company because 8 / .25 = 32. 40% of the employees are men because 100 - 60 = 40. The company has 80 workers because 32 / .4 = 80. There are 48 women at the company because 80 - 32 = 48.
The answer: 48

Question: At Sarah's job 60% of the employees are women and the rest are men. Of the men, 75% have a college degree and 8 do not. How many women work at Sarah's company?

Reasoning and answer: If the two men each bought 30 apples, together they bought 2 * 30 = 60 apples. Since the two men each bought 30 apples, 20 less than the total number of apples bought by each woman, each woman bought 20 + 30 = 50 apples. The total number of apples bought by the women is 3 * 50 = 150. Altogether, the two men and three women bought 60 + 150 = 210 apples.
The answer: 210
