Question: Julia just adopted a puppy for $20.00 from the local pet shelter. Before she brings the puppy home, she needs to buy a bag of dog food for $20.00, 2 bags of treats for $2.50 a bag, an assortment box of toys for $15.00, a crate and a bed for $20.00 each, and the collar/leash combo for $15.00. The store offered Julia a 20% new-customer discount. How much will Julia spend on the new puppy?
Answer: The treats are $2.50 a bag and she buys 2 bags for a total of 2.50 * 2 = $5.00. The crate and bed are $20.00 each so they will cost 2 * 20 = $40.00. She spends $20.00 on dog food, $5.00 on treats, $15.00 on toys $40.00 for a crate and bed and $15.00 for a leash for a total of 20 + 5 + 15 + 40 + 15 = $95.00. With the 20% off, she can expect a .20 * 95 = $19 discount on her order. Her supplies were $95.00 and she has a $19.00 discount for a total of 95 - 19 = $76.00. Her supplies cost $76.00 and the puppy adoption was $20.00 for a grand total of 76 + 20 = $96.00. The answer is 96.
[Question]Leila and her friends want to rent a car for their one-day trip that is 150 kilometers long each way. The first option for a car rental costs $50 a day, excluding gasoline. The second option costs $90 a day including gasoline. A liter of gasoline can cover 15 kilometers and costs $0.90 per liter. Their car rental will need to carry them to and from their destination. How much will they save if they will choose the first option rather than the second one?
[Answer]Leila and her friends will travel a total distance of 150 x 2 = 300 kilometers back - and - forth. They will need 300 / 15 = 20 liters of gasoline for this trip. So, they will pay $0.90 x 20 = $18 for the gasoline. Thus, the first option will costs them $50 + $18 = $68. Therefore, they can save $90 - $68 = $22 if they choose the first option. The answer is 22.

[Answer]If Rayden bought three times as many ducks as Lily, then he has 3 * 20 = 60 ducks. He has 60 - 20 = 40 more ducks than Lily has. Rayden also bought 4 * 10 = 40 geese, four times the geese that Lily bought. He has 40 - 10 = 30 more ducks than Lily. Altogether, Rayden has 30 + 40 = 70 more ducks and geese than Lily.
