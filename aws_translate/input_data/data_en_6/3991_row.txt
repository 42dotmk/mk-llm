Reasoning and answer: Tara has to make a $1000 x 20 / 100 = $200 down payment. Since Tara wants to pay $20 more for the down payment, her total down payment will be $200 + $20 = $220. So her remaining balance payable over a year is $1000 - $220 = $780. Tara has to make a monthly payment of $780 / year / 12 months / year = $65 / month. The total cost of her payments for 4 months is $65 / month x 4 months = $260. Therefore, Tara's balance after 4 months is $780 - $260 = $520.
The answer: 520

Jerry has to walk to the sink / recycling bin 28 cans / 4 cans per trip = 7 trips. The round trip takes 10 seconds per way * 2 ways = 20 seconds. Counting the time he spent pouring out the cans and the time the round trip took, he spent 20 seconds per trip + 30 seconds per trip = 50 seconds per trip. With 7 round trips, he spent 50 seconds per trip * 7 trips = 350 seconds.
The answer: 350
