To affix planks of wood securely together, you can pursue several methods depending on the desired outcome, materials, tools available, and your level of expertise. Some of the most effective methods are using glue, nails, screws, dowels, biscuits, and mortise and tenon joints. Here's a detailed explanation of each method and how you can use it to achieve the goal:

1. Gluing: Wood glue is an excellent adhesive for joining wooden planks. It creates a strong bond when applied appropriately. Follow these steps for this method:
   a. Choose a high-quality wood glue, ideally one that is waterproof if the planks will be exposed to moisture.
   b. Sand the edges of the planks to be joined for a better bond.
   c. Apply a generous amount of glue on one edge of a plank, ensuring full coverage. 
   d. Press the second plank's edge against the first plank with the glue applied.
   e. Use clamps to secure the planks tightly, evenly distributing pressure along the joint.
   f. Wipe off any excess glue with a damp cloth.
   g. Allow the glue to cure according to the manufacturer's instructions.

2. Nailing: This method uses nails to join planks. Here's how you can go about it:
   a. Choose the appropriate size of nails for the thickness of the wooden planks.
   b. Position the planks as desired. 
   c. Hammer the nails through the top plank into the second plank, spacing them evenly and ensuring they penetrate both planks.
   d. Use a nail set to countersink the nails if desired.

3. Screwing: Screws offer strong support to the wooden planks due to their thread design. Follow these steps:
   a. Choose the appropriate size of wood screws.
   b. Position the planks.
   c. Pre-drill pilot holes through the first plank into the second plank, ensuring the holes are slightly smaller than the screw size.
   d. Drive the screws into the pilot holes, firmly joining the planks.

4. Dowels: Dowel joints create strong connections when used with glue. Here's the process:
   a. Mark dowel positions along the edges of the planks to be joined.
   b. Drill holes to accommodate the dowels, ensuring they align perfectly.
   c. Apply glue in the holes and on the dowels.
   d. Insert dowels into the holes and press the planks together.
   e. Clamp the planks together and allow the glue to cure.

5. Biscuit joints: Biscuit joinery uses small, oval-shaped wood pieces (biscuits) to connect planks. Follow these steps:
   a. Mark biscuit locations along the edges of the planks.
   b. Use a biscuit joiner to cut corresponding slots in the planks' edges.
   c. Apply glue to the slots and insert the biscuits.
   d. Press the planks together with the glue and biscuits in place.
   e. Clamp the planks until the glue cures.

6. Mortise and tenon joints: This method creates strong connections, especially for structural elements.
   a. Cut a rectangular hole (mortise) in one plank and a matching rectangular projection (tenon) on another plank's edge.
   b. Apply glue to the tenon and mortise.
   c. Insert the tenon into the mortise and secure the planks together.
   d. If necessary, use clamps or dowels for added stability.

Select the best method based on the specific project, available tools, and your woodworking abilities. Each method has its advantages, and combining multiple methods can further enhance the strength and stability of the joined planks.
