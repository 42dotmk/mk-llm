To solve this task, we'll follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty list called `result` to store our final output.
2. Loop through the outer list.
3. For each inner list, initialize a variable called `inner_product` and set it to 1.
4. Loop through the inner list.
5. Check if the number is even (i.e., divisible by 2).
6. If it is even, multiply it by `inner_product` and store the result back into `inner_product`.
7. Once the inner loop is done, check if `inner_product` is still 1 (it means there's no even number in the inner list). If so, append 0 to the `result` list. Otherwise, append `inner_product` to the `result` list.
8. Repeat steps 3-7 for all inner lists in the outer list.
9. Return the `result` list.

Now let's apply these steps to the given input:

Q: [[49, 22, -43], [9, -19, 29, 19, 32], [-49, -35, 28, 23], [37, 13, 24, -30, -18], [9, 5], [-20, -13, 31, -20], [33, -50], [-27, 37]]

A: 

1. result = []
2. Loop through the outer list:
   - Inner list 1: [49, 22, -43]
     - inner_product = 1
     - Loop through the inner list:
       - 49 (not even, do nothing)
       - 22 (even, inner_product = 1 * 22 = 22)
       - -43 (not even, do nothing)
     - inner_product is not 1, so append 22 to result.
   - Inner list 2: [9, -19, 29, 19, 32]
     - inner_product = 1
     - Loop through the inner list:
       - 9 (not even, do nothing)
       - -19 (not even, do nothing)
       - 29 (not even, do nothing)
       - 19 (not even, do nothing)
       - 32 (even, inner_product = 1 * 32 = 32)
     - inner_product is not 1, so append 32 to result.
   - Inner list 3: [-49, -35, 28, 23]
     - inner_product = 1
     - Loop through the inner list:
       - -49 (not even, do nothing)
       - -35 (not even, do nothing)
       - 28 (even, inner_product = 1 * 28 = 28)
       - 23 (not even, do nothing)
     - inner_product is not 1, so append 28 to result.
   - Inner list 4: [37, 13, 24, -30, -18]
     - inner_product = 1
     - Loop through the inner list:
       - 37 (not even, do nothing)
       - 13 (not even, do nothing)
       - 24 (even, inner_product = 1 * 24 = 24)
       - -30 (even, inner_product = 24 * -30 = -720)
       - -18 (even, inner_product = -720 * -18 = 12960)
     - inner_product is not 1, so append 12960 to result.
   - Inner list 5: [9, 5]
     - inner_product = 1
     - Loop through the inner list:
       - 9 (not even, do nothing)
       - 5 (not even, do nothing)
     - inner_product is still 1, so append 0 to result.
   - Inner list 6: [-20, -13, 31, -20]
     - inner_product = 1
     - Loop through the inner list:
       - -20 (even, inner_product = 1 * -20=-20)
       - -13 (not even, do nothing)
       - 31 (not even, do nothing)
       - -20 (even, inner_product = -20 * -20 = 400)
     - inner_product is not 1, so append 400 to result.
   - Inner list 7: [33, -50]
     - inner_product = 1
     - Loop through the inner list:
       - 33 (not even, do nothing)
       - -50 (even, inner_product = 1 * -50 = -50)
     - inner_product is not 1, so append -50 to result.
   - Inner list 8: [-27, 37]
     - inner_product = 1
     - Loop through the inner list:
       - -27 (not even, do nothing)
       - 37 (not even, do nothing)
     - inner_product is still 1, so append 0 to result.
3. Final result = [22, 32, 28, 12960, 0, 400, -50, 0]

The answer is [22, 32, 28, 12960, 0, 400, -50, 0].
