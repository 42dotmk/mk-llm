Q: Jacob has been tasked with a project to write up an urban plan proposal that will be used to construct a new city. He uses Pittsburg city as a reference which has 2000 stores, 500 hospitals, 200 schools, and 20 police stations. If the new city should have half the number of stores, twice as many hospitals, 50 fewer schools, and 5 more police stations, what is the total number of buildings required for this project?
A: The number of stores required for the new city is 2000 / 2 = 1000 stores. The number of hospitals required for the new city is 2 * 500 = 1000 hospitals. The number of schools required for the new city is 200 - 50 = 150 schools. The number of police stations required for the new city is 20 + 5 = 25 police stations. The total number of buildings required for this new city project 1000 + 1000 + 150 + 25 = 2175 buildings. The answer is 2175.
Question: They say the first year of a dog's life equals 15 human years. The second year of a dog's life equals 9 human years and after that, every year of a dog's life equals 5 human years. According to this logic, how many human years has my 10-year-old dog lived?
Answer: If your dog is 10 years old then in his first year of life he lived 1 * 15 = 15 human years. In his second year of life, he lived 1 * 9 = 9 human years. We need to calculate his remaining years or 10 - 2 = 8 years of dog life into human years. If 1 year of dog life after the 2 years equates to 5 human years, then 8 years of dog life equals 8 * 5 = 40 human years. In total, your dog has lived 15 + 9 + 40 = 64 human years. The answer is 64.
[Question]A Burmese python that was 1.4 meters long swallowed a 50-centimeter alligator. After one week, the alligator was completely digested. If this snake continues to eat 50-centimeter-long alligators at a constant rate of one alligator per week, what is the maximum number of alligators that the snake can eat in 616 days?
[Answer]Since one week is 7 days. 616 days is 616 / 7 = 88 weeks. Since the python eats 1 alligator per week, in 88 weeks it can eat 88 / 1 = 88 alligators. The answer is 88.
Q: Darius, Matt, and Marius are friends, who played table football. During all the games they played, Marius scored 3 points more than Darius, and Darius scored 5 points less than Matt. How many points did all three friends score together, if Darius scored 10 points?
A: If Darius scored 10 points, then Marius scored 10 + 3 = 13 points in total. Darius scored 5 points less than Matt, so Matt scored 10 + 5 = 15 points in total. So all three friends gathered 13 + 15 + 10 = 38 points. The answer is 38.
Question: Kim drives 30 miles to her friend's house. On the way back she has to take a detour that is 20% longer. She spends 30 minutes at her friend's house. She drives at a speed of 44 mph. How long did she spend away from home?
Answer: The trip back was 30 * .2 = 6 miles longer than the trip there. So it was 30 + 6 = 36 miles. So the total drive was 30 + 36 = 66 miles. That means she drove for 66 / 44 = 1.5 hours. She stayed with her friend 30 / 60 = .5 hours. So the total time was 1.5 + .5 = 2 hours. The answer is 2.
