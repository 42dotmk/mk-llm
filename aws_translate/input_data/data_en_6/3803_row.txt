The answer to these two questions would not be the same, as they are requesting different outcomes from the headmaster. In the first question, you are requesting the headmaster to submit the project, while in the second question, you are requesting the headmaster to permit absence for your son without submitting the project. I will provide you with step-by-step guidelines for writing each letter.

Question 1: How do I write a letter to the headmaster requesting him to submit the project?

Step 1: Start with the date and salutation
Begin by writing the date on the top left corner of the page, followed by the appropriate salutation (e.g., "Dear Headmaster," or "Respected Headmaster,").

Step 2: Introduce yourself and state the purpose of the letter
Mention your name, your child's name, and the class in which your child is studying. State that the purpose of the letter is to request the submission of a project on behalf of your child.

Step 3: Explain the project
Provide details about the project, such as the subject, topic, and due date. Additionally, mention any guidelines that need to be followed for project submission.

Step 4: Explain why you're requesting the headmaster's assistance
Explain the circumstances that warrant your request for the headmaster's involvement in submitting the project. This could be an emergency, a medical condition, or any other valid reason that has prevented you from submitting the project yourself.

Step 5: Express your gratitude and close the letter
Thank the headmaster for considering your request and mention that you appreciate their help in ensuring your child's academic progress. Close the letter with appropriate regards (e.g., "Sincerely," or "Yours faithfully,") followed by your name and contact information.

Question 2: How do I write a letter to the headmaster requesting him to absent my son and not submit the project?

Step 1: Start with the date and salutation
Similar to the first letter, begin by writing the date and an appropriate salutation to address the headmaster.

Step 2: Introduce yourself and state the purpose of the letter
Mention your name, your child's name, and the class in which your child is studying. State that the purpose of the letter is to request permission to absent your son from school without submitting the project.

Step 3: Explain the reason for your son's absence
Provide the reason for your son's absence from school, such as illness, a family emergency, or any other circumstances that warrant the request.

Step 4: Request permission to not submit the project
Explain how the aforementioned circumstances have also prevented your son from completing and submitting the project on time. Request the headmaster's understanding and permission for your son to not submit the project at this time.

Step 5: Discuss next steps (if applicable)
If there are plans to submit the project at a later date, mention those intentions. You can also ask for any additional guidelines or requirements for late submission if deemed necessary.

Step 6: Express your gratitude and close the letter
Thank the headmaster for considering your request and mention that you appreciate their understanding and support in these circumstances. Close the letter with an appropriate regard (e.g., "Sincerely," or "Yours faithfully,") followed by your name and contact information.
