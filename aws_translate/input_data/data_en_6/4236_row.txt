The character was created by writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane and made his first appearance in Detective Comics #58 in December 1941. The Penguin is one of Batman's most enduring and well-known foes, known for his distinctive appearance, sharp wit, and criminal genius.

The Penguin, as his name suggests, is often depicted as a short, rotund man wearing a tuxedo, top hat, monocle, and carrying an umbrella that conceals various gadgets and weapons. His waddle-like walk and bird-like features, along with his penchant for using birds in his criminal pursuits, earned him the nickname "The Penguin". Oswald Cobblepot is a man who embraces his outward appearance and uses it as one of his many tools in his villainous endeavors.

Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot was born into a wealthy family but faced many challenges in his early life. His father died of bronchial pneumonia, and his overprotective mother made him carry an umbrella constantly to shield him from rain and illnesses. He was mercilessly teased and bullied by his peers because of his short stature and odd appearance. Soon after his mother's death, Oswald lost the family fortune forcing him to survive in the harsh streets of Gotham City. These early struggles fueled Oswald's desire for power and wealth, ultimately leading him down the path of crime.
