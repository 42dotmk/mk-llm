[Question]A truck driver has to spend $2 per gallon of gas. She can drive 10 miles per gallon. She drives at a rate of 30 miles per hour. If she is paid $.50 per mile, how much money does she make if she drives for 10 hours?
[Answer]The truck driver drives for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so she drives 10 * 30 = 300 miles. Therefore, she needs 300 / 10 = 30 gallons of gas. This will cost her 30 * $2 = $60. She will make 300 * $.50 = $150. Thus, after paying for gas, she will make $150 - $60 = $90. The answer is 90.
Q: Jessica just got her driving permit. She must complete 50 hours of driving with a parent to get her driverâ€™s license. It takes 20 minutes to drive to school. If she drives to and from school every day, how many school days will it take Jessica to meet the 50-hour driving requirement?
A: Jessica will drive 20 minutes, twice every school day (to and from school), so 20 minutes x 2 trips = 40 minutes each day. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so 50 hours of driving x 60 minutes / hour = 3,000 minutes. If you take the 3,000 minutes she needs to drive / 40 minutes driving each day = 75 school days to drive 50 hours. The answer is 75.
Question: Rubble has $15 in his pocket and he needs to buy 2 notebooks and 2 pens. Each notebook cost $4.00 meanwhile each pen cost $1.50. How much money will be left from Rubble after the purchase?
Answer: The total cost of two notebooks is $4.00 x 2 = $8.00. The total cost of two pen $1.50 x 2 = $3.00. So, the total amount Rubble spent for all the stuff was $8.00 + $3.00 = $11.00. Therefore, Rubble was left off with $15.00 - $11.00 = $4.00. The answer is 4.
[Question]When three friends sold their video games, Ryan, the first of the three friends, received $50 more than Jason from his sales. Jason received 30% more money than Zachary from selling his video games. If Zachary sold 40 games at $5 each, calculate the total amount of money the three friends received together from the sale of the video games.
[Answer]The total amount of money that Zachary received from selling his video games is $40 * 5 = $200. Jason received 30 / 100 * $200 = $60 more than the amount Zachary received after selling his games. The total amount of money that Jason received is $60 + $200 = $260. Together, Zachary and Jason received $260 + $200 = $460 from the sale of their video games. Ryan received $260 + $50 = $310 from the sale of his video games. The three friends made a total of $310 + $460 = $770 from the sale of the video games. The answer is 770.
Q: Bret and a team of 3 co-workers were working late so he ordered dinner for everyone. They decided on Chinese. Each main meal costs $12.0. They also ordered 2 appetizers that were $6.00 each. He includes a 20% tip and an extra $5.00 to make it a rush order. How much does Bret spend on dinner?
A: There are 4 co - workers and each of their meals is $12.00 so 4 * 12 = $48.00. They order 2 appetizers at $6.00 each so 2 * 6 = $12.00. The meals costs $48.00 and the appetizers costs $12.00 for a total of 48 + 12 = $60.00. A 20% tip on the $60.00 order is .20 * 60 = $12.00. So the meal is $60.00, the tip is $12.00 and he adds a $5.00 rush for a total of 60 + 12 + 5 = $77.00. The answer is 77.
