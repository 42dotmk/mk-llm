Q: Mary is making a model sailboat. She wants to add three sails: a rectangular sail that measures 5 inches by 8 inches and two right triangular sails, one that's 3 inches long at the bottom and 4 inches tall and one that's 4 inches long at the bottom and 6 inches tall. (Remember you can find the area of a triangle by dividing the area of a square with the same height and length by 2). How many square inches of canvas does she need total?
A: First find the area of the square sail: 5 inches * 8 inches = 40 square inches. Then find the area of a square sail with the same height and length as the first triangular sail: 3 inches * 4 inches = 12 square inches. Then divide the area in two to find the area of the triangular sail: 12 square inches / 2 = 6 square inches. Then find the area of a square sail with the same height and length as the second triangular sail: 4 inches * 6 inches = 24 square inches. Then divide the area in two to find the area of the triangular sail: 24 square inches / 2 = 12 square inches. Then add up the areas of all the sails to find the total amount of canvas needed: 12 square inches + 6 square inches + 40 square inches = 58 square inches. The answer is 58.
Question: Jude bought three chairs for his house, all at the same price. He also bought a table that costs $50 and two sets of plates at $20 for each set. After giving the cashier $130, Jude got a $4 change. How much did each of the chairs cost?
Answer: The two sets of plates amount to $20 x 2 = $40. So the table and the two sets of plates amount to $50 + $40 = $90 in all. Since Jude received a $4 change, then he paid a total of $130 - $4 = $126 for the chairs, tables, and plates. Thus, the three chairs cost $126 - $90 = $36. Therefore, each chair cost $36 / 3 = $12. The answer is 12.
[Question]The base of a hill located beside a river is 300m above the seabed. If this depth is a quarter of the vertical distance between the riverbed and the peak of the hill, how high is the hill?
[Answer]300m is a quarter of the distance from the riverbed to the hill's peak so (1 / 4) * distance from riverbed to peak = 300m. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 4 gives the distance from riverbed to peak = 300m * 4 = 1200m. The height of the hill is the difference between the distance from the riverbed to the hill's peak and the distance from the riverbed to the hill's base which is 1200m - 300m = 900m. The answer is 900.
Q: Micah drank 1.5 liters of water in the morning. Then she drank three times that much water in the afternoon. How many liters of water did she drink from the morning until the afternoon?
A: Micah drank 1.5 x 3 = 4.5 liters in the afternoon. She drank a total of 1.5 + 4.5 = 6 liters of water. The answer is 6.
Question: John takes a 10-minute shower every other day for 4 weeks. If his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute. How much water does he use in those 4 weeks?
Answer: There are 4 * 7 = 28 days in those 4 weeks. That means he takes 28 / 2 = 14 showers. So he takes a total of 14 * 10 = 140 minutes of showers. So he uses 2 * 140 = 280 gallons of water. The answer is 280.
