[Question]It takes a dog groomer 10 minutes to dry a short-haired dog like a beagle. It takes him twice as long to dry a full-haired, fluffy dog like a german shepherd. One morning, he has 6 short-haired dogs to dry and 9 full-haired dogs to dry. How many hours does it take him to dry all of the dogs?
[Answer]It takes 10 minutes to dry the coat of a short - haired dog and twice as long for a full haired dog so they take 10 * 2 = 20 minutes to dry. He had 6 short hair dogs and they took 10 minutes to dry each so they took 6 * 10 = 60 minutes to dry. He had 9 full haired dogs that took 20 minutes to dry each so they took 9 * 20 = 180 minutes to dry. Together is takes him 60 + 180 = 240 minutes to dry all of the dogs. 60 minutes are in 1 hour and he spends 240 minutes on the dogs so he worked for 240 / 60 = 4 hours drying the dogs. The answer is 4.
Q: Hanna has twice as many erasers as Rachel. Rachel has three less than one-half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers. If Tanya has 20 erasers, and half of them are red, how many erasers does Hanna have?
A: Half of Tanya's 20 erasers are red, so she has 20 / 2 = 10 red erasers. One - half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers is 10 / 2 = 5 red erasers. Rachel's three less than one - half as many erasers as Tanya's red erasers, which is 5 - 3 = 2 erasers. Hanna has twice as many erasers as Rachel, for a total of 2 * 2 = 4 erasers. The answer is 4.
Question: Catriona has 8 goldfish in her aquarium. She has 4 more angelfish than goldfish. Also, she has twice as many guppies as angelfish. How many fish does Catriona have in her aquarium?
Answer: Catriona has 8 + 4 = 12 angelfish. She also has 12 x 2 = 24 guppies. Thus, she has 8 + 12 + 24 = 44 fish in her aquarium. The answer is 44.
[Question]Jenny had $24 left after spending 3/7 of her money. How much is half of her original amount of money?
[Answer]Jenny spent 1 - 3 / 7 = 4 / 7 of her money. Since 4 / 7 is equal to $24, then 1 / 7 is equal to $24 / 4 = $6. So, Jenny originally had $6 x 7 = $42. Therefore, half of her original amount of money is $42 / 2 = $21. The answer is 21.
Q: Carly is making burgers for a neighborhood BBQ. Each burger needs to be cooked for 4 minutes on each side. Carly can fit 5 burgers on the grill at once. If half her 30 guests want 2 burgers and the other half each want 1, how long will it take Carly to cook all the burgers?
A: First find half the number of guests at Carly's party: 30 guests / 2 = 15 guests. Then multiply that number by 2 for the number of burgers half the guests want: 15 guests * 2 burgers / guest = 30 burgers. Then add the 15 burgers for the 15 guests who only want 1 to find the total number of burgers: 30 burgers + 15 burgers = 45 burgers. Then divide the total number of burgers by the number of burgers Carly can cook at once to find the number of batches she cooks: 45 burgers / 5 burgers / batch = 9 batches. Then multiply the number of sides per burger by the cooking time per side to find each burger's total cook time: 4 minutes / side * 2 sides = 8 minutes. Finally, multiply each batch's cook time by the number of batches to find the total cook time: 8 minutes / batch * 9 batches = 72 minutes. The answer is 72.
