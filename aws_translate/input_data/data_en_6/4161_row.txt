The Basic Recipe

Ingredients:
- 1 pound of ground beef
- 1 medium-sized onion, chopped
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 teaspoon of garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon of onion powder
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- Optional toppings: sour cream, chopped parsley, shredded cheese

Instructions

1. Before you start cooking, make sure to prep your ingredients. Chop the onion into small, evenly-sized pieces to ensure even cooking and a pleasant texture. For the ground beef, choose a lean or regular option, depending on your preference for fat content.

2. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, and cook until it begins to soften and turn translucent, which typically takes about 3-5 minutes. Make sure to stir the onions frequently to prevent them from sticking to the skillet or browning too quickly.

3. Add the ground beef to the skillet with the onions. Break the beef up into smaller pieces using a spatula or wooden spoon to make sure it cooks evenly. As the beef cooks, season it with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.

4. Continue cooking the beef and onion mixture, stirring occasionally, for about 8-10 minutes, or until the beef is cooked through and no longer pink in the middle.

5. At this point, you can choose to add additional ingredients to the skillet to further enhance the flavor of the dish. Some popular options include diced tomatoes, bell peppers, or mushrooms. Cook the mixture for another 3-5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.

6. Once your skillet beef and onion is cooked to your liking, remove it from the heat and allow it to cool for a couple of minutes. Serve warm, topped with sour cream, chopped parsley, or shredded cheese for a finishing touch that adds extra flavor and creaminess.

Recipe Variations

While the basic recipe for skillet beef and onion is delicious on its own, you can easily mix it up with additional ingredients and seasonings. For example, you can add a Mexican twist by mixing in taco seasoning, black beans, corn, and diced green chilis. Alternatively, you can experiment with Italian flavors by adding marinara sauce, Italian seasoning, and serving over pasta. The possibilities are endless to suit your personal taste preferences.
