that Jane Austen is to feature on the new £10 note is fantastic news, and a testament to the public's affection for one of the greatest writers in English literature,' said Mr. Carney at a press conference held at the Jane Austen House Museum in Chawton, Hampshire.

As the news spread, it was met with a mixed response. Some people praised the decision as a nod to gender equality and a representation of one of the most influential women in British history. Feminist campaigners celebrated the Bank's decision to feature Austen, who ranks among the literary greats such as William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens. Writer and activist Caroline Criado-Perez, who launched the initial campaign to have a woman featured on the banknotes, expressed her joy at the announcement, stating that the inclusion of Jane Austen was a victory for women's representation.

However, others argued that there were many other deserving women who could have been featured, particularly those who had made significant achievements in science, politics, or activism. Critics questioned the decision to include another literary figure when there were already numerous writers featured on current banknotes, arguing that it would have been more appropriate to honor a woman from a different field.

As the design process for the new £10 note began, it featured an image of Jane Austen based on a portrait commissioned by her nephew, James Edward Austen-Leigh, in 1870. Banknote designer Debbie Marriott worked closely with historians and Austen experts to ensure the image's authenticity and capture Austen's spirit. In addition to Austen's portrait, the new note design featured elements inspired by her life and works, including an image of her writing desk, a quill, and quotes from her novels.

The new £10 note entered circulation in 2017 and received widespread praise for its aesthetic appeal and use of innovative security features such as a clear window with the Queen's portrait and a hologram of the coronation crown. A special event marked the launch of the new note, held at Winchester Cathedral, where Jane Austen was interred.

Despite the initial controversy surrounding the choice of Jane Austen, it was clear that the public had embraced the new £10 note. It served as a lasting tribute to Austen's literary legacy and her impact on British culture, while also promoting the conversation around women's representation and highlighting the importance of representation across various fields.

Over time, in the spirit of equal representation, the Bank of England continued to introduce new banknotes featuring other influential female figures from diverse fields on its banknotes. This ongoing effort served as a reminder of the many exceptional women who contributed to shaping British history and society over the centuries.

In conclusion, the story of introducing Jane Austen on the new £10 note showcases the power of public opinion in influencing decisions and shaping our society. It is a testament to Austen's lasting impact on English literature and a symbol of the importance of diversity and equal representation in honoring the diverse figures who have contributed to history across different fields. The story ends with Jane Austen's portrait proudly featured on the £10 note, and the subsequent waves of celebration and debate over the historical significance of this design decision.
