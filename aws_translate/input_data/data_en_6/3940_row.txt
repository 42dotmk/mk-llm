Preparing the colored rainbow cookie dough for cooking can be a fun and creative activity. To make the perfect rainbow cookies, it is essential to prepare the dough correctly to achieve the vibrant colors and delicious taste. Here is a step-by-step guide on the best way to prepare colored rainbow cookie dough for cooking:

1. Gather the needed ingredients:
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups granulated sugar
- 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- Food coloring (gel-based for best results) in a variety of rainbow colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet)

2. Begin by combining the dry ingredients. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. Set this mixture aside for later use.

3. Cream the butter and sugar together. In a large mixing bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the softened unsalted butter and granulated sugar together until the mixture becomes light and fluffy. This should take approximately 3-4 minutes.

4. Gradually add in the wet ingredients. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, into the butter mixture. Make sure to mix well after each addition. Then, add the vanilla extract and lemon zest, mixing until they are well incorporated.

5. Slowly combine the dry and wet mixtures. Gradually add the dry flour mixture to the wet butter mixture, mixing at a low speed until the dough is combined.

6. Divide the dough evenly into separate bowls. Determine how many colors you want for your rainbow cookies. Divide the dough evenly into the same number of small bowls based on the number of colors you have chosen. For a typical rainbow, you will need seven colors and seven small bowls.

7. Add food coloring to each bowl. Using gel-based food coloring, color each portion of dough with a different color. Start with small amounts of food coloring and mix until you are satisfied with the intensity of the color.

8. Cover and chill the colored dough. Cover each bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes to an hour or until the dough is firm enough to handle. Chilling the dough will make it easier to roll and shape the cookies.

9. Prepare the cookies for baking. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

10. Shape the colored dough into small balls. Remove the chilled dough from the refrigerator. Take one piece from each colored dough and roll them into small, even-sized balls, approximately 1-inch in diameter.

11. Combine the colored dough balls. Gently press and roll the colored balls of dough together to form one large ball, making sure not to mix the colors too much to maintain the rainbow effect. Then, slightly flatten the ball with the palm of your hand.

12. Place the cookies on the baking sheet. Arrange the dough balls about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet as they will expand during baking.

13. Bake the cookies. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are slightly golden and the cookies are set. Remove them from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Now your colored rainbow cookie dough is ready for cooking. Enjoy the vibrant and delicious rainbow cookies with family and friends!
