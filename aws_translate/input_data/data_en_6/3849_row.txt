Question: Christian and Sue wanted to get a $50.00 bottle of perfume for their mom for her birthday. Christian had $5.00 saved up and Sue had $7.00. Christian then mowed 4 of his neighbors' yards, charging $5.00 each, while Sue walked 6 dogs for her neighbors, charging $2.00 per dog. How much more money will Christian and Sue need to make in order to buy the bottle of perfume for their mom?
Answer: Christian just mowed 4 yards at $5.00 each so he made 4 * 5 = $20.00. Sue just walked 6 dogs at $2.00 each so she made 6 * 2 = $12.00. Christian had $5.00 saved and just made $20.00 while Sue had $7.00 saved and just made $12.00 so together they had 5 + 20 + 7 + 12 = $44. The perfume cost $50.00 and they had $44.00 so they needed to make 50 - 44 = $6.00 more dollars. The answer is 6.
[Question]To make a cherry pie, Veronica needs 3 pounds of pitted cherries. There are 80 single cherries in one pound of cherries.  It takes 10 minutes to pit 20 cherries. How many hours will it take Veronica to pit all the cherries?
[Answer]There are 80 cherries in a pound and she needs 3 pounds to make a pie so she needs 80 * 3 = 240 cherries. It takes her 10 minutes to pit a unit of 20 cherries. She has 240 / 20 = 12 units of cherries to pit. It takes 10 minutes to pit a unit of cherries and she has 12 units so it will take her 10 * 12 = 120 minutes. 60 minutes are in 1 hour and it takes her 120 minutes so thatâ€™s 120 / 60 = 2 hours. The answer is 2.
Q: Jane's goal is to exercise 1 hour a day, 5 days a week. If she hits her goal weekly for 8 weeks, how many hours has Jane exercised?
A: Her goal is 1 hour a day for 5 days so on a weekly basis, she exercises 1 * 5 = 5 hours. If she works 5 hours a week for 8 weeks then she exercises 5 * 8 = 40 hours in 8 weeks. The answer is 40.
Question: Mike bought a DVD of his favorite movie. He paid $5 for it at the store. A friend of Mike's, Steve, saw this and also decided to buy a DVD of the movie, but it was already sold out. He needed to order it online, which cost him twice as much. And in addition, he needed to pay the shipping costs which were 80% of the price of the film he ordered. How much did Steve pay to get the DVD in total?
Answer: The cost of the movie online was twice what Mike paid, so 2 * 5 = $10. The shopping costs were standing at 80 / 100 * 10 = $8. So in total Steve paid 10 + 8 = $18. The answer is 18.
[Question]Balki is counting the number of raisins in boxes of cereal. He counted 437 total raisins in 5 boxes. In one box he counted 72 raisins. In a second box he counted 74 raisins. The other three boxes had the same number each. How many were in each of the other three boxes?
[Answer]Let x = the number of raisins in each of the other 3 boxes. Then 72 + 74 + 3x = 437 raisins. Combining like terms we get 146 + 3x = 437 raisins. Subtracting 146 from both sides we get 3x = 291 raisins. Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 291 / 3 = 97 raisins. The answer is 97.
