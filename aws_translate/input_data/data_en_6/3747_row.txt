[Question]Betty is 60 years old, and she is the oldest person in the family. Her daughter is 40 percent younger than she is, and her granddaughter is one-third her mother's age. How old is the granddaughter?
[Answer]Betty's daughter is 40 / 100 * 60 = 24 years younger than she is. That means her daughter is 60 - 24 = 36 years old. So the granddaughter is 1 / 3 * 36 = 12 years old. The answer is 12.
Q: Colton had 72 dolphin stickers. He gave 4 stickers each to 3 friends. He also gave his friend Mandy 2 more than he gave his three friends total.  And he gave Justin 10 less than Mandy. How many stickers does Colton have left?
A: Colton gave away 4 stickers * 3 friends = 12 stickers. Colton gave Mandy 2 + 12 stickers = 14 stickers. Colton gave Justin 14 stickers - 10 = 4 stickers. In total, Colton gave away 12 + 14 + 4 stickers = 30 stickers. Colton's number of total stickers at the end is 72 - 30 = 42 stickers. The answer is 42.
Question: Andy started out the year weighing 156 pounds. He then grew 3 inches and gained 36 pounds. Andy wasn't happy with his weight and decided to exercise. Over the next 3 months, he lost an eighth of his weight every month. How much less does Andy weigh now than at the beginning of the year?
Answer: Andy weighed 156 + 36 = 192 pounds after growing taller. An eighth of his weight is 1 / 8 x 192 = 24 pounds. Over the next 3 months, Andy lost 24 x 3 = 72 pounds. He now weighs 192 - 72 = 120 pounds. Andy weighs 156 - 120 = 36 pounds less than at the beginning of the year. The answer is 36.
[Question]A family has three adults and children, both girls and boys. They went out for a family trip and prepared 3 dozen boiled eggs for the trip. Every adult got 3 eggs, and the boys each received 1 more egg than each girl since the girls had some snacks. How many boys went on the trip if the number of girls was 7 and each girl received an egg?
[Answer]The total number of eggs the family had is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs. If each adult received 3 eggs, the total number of eggs they got is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. The children shared 36 - 9 = 27 eggs. Since each girl received an egg, the boys shared 27 - 7 = 20 eggs. If each boy received 1 egg more than each girl, each received 1 + 1 = 2 eggs. The boys received 20 eggs, and if each got 2 eggs, then 20 / 2 = 10 boys went on the trip. The answer is 10.
Q: Missy had a giant piggy bank in her bedroom. Every day she would search the house for change to put in her bank. After 4 years, the bank was opened and it contained $450 in change. If the second, third, and fourth-year she doubled the amount of money she put in the bank from the amount she had put in the previous year, how much money, in dollars, did she put in the bank the first year?
A: We let x be the amount of money she put in the bank the first year,. Then the second year was 2 * x,. and the third year was 2 * 2 * x = 4 * x,. and the fourth year was 2 * 2 * 2 * x = 8 * x. And the total amount she put in the bank, $450, is the sum of all four years, or $450 = x + (2 * x) + (4 * x) + (8 * x). This simplifies to $450 = 15 * x. And therefore, the amount of money she put in the bank the first year was x = $30. The answer is 30.
