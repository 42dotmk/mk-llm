Question: James decides to build a tin house by collecting 500 tins in a week. On the first day, he collects 50 tins. On the second day, he manages to collect 3 times that number. On the third day, he collects 50 tins fewer than the number he collected on the second day. If he collects an equal number of tins on the remaining days of the week, what's the number of tins he collected each day for the rest of the week?
Answer: On the second day, he collected 3 times the number of tins he collected on the first day, which is 3 * 50 = 150 tins. On the third day, he collected 50 tins fewer than the second day, which is 150 - 50 = 100 tins. The total for the three days is 150 + 100 + 50 = 300 tins. To reach his goal, he still needs 500 - 300 = 200 tins. Since the total number of days left in the week is 4, he'll need to collect 200 / 4 = 50 tins per day to reach his goal. The answer is 50.
[Question]Simon wanted to buy flowers that his mom could plant for Mother's Day. The garden center was offering 10% off all purchases. He bought 5 pansies at $2.50 each, one hydrangea that cost $12.50 and 5 petunias that cost $1.00 each. If he paid with a $50 bill, how much change would Simon receive back from his purchase?
[Answer]5 pansies at $2.50 each is 5 * 2.50 = $12.50. 5 petunias at $1.00 each 5 * 1 = $5.00. All total he spends 12.50 + 12.50 + 5.00 = $30.00. The sale is 10% off so 30 * .10 = $3.00. The purchase total now comes to 30 - 3 = $27.00. He pays with a $50 bill so 50 - 27 = $23.00. The answer is 23.
Q: On a road map, 1/4 inch represents 8 miles of actual road distance. The towns of Pence and Hillcrest are represented by points 3 3/8 inches apart on the map. What is the actual distance, in miles, between the towns?
A: If 1 / 4 inch on the map represents 8 miles on real land, 1 inch represents 4 * 8 = 32 miles. Since 1 inch represents 32 miles, 3 inches represent 3 * 32 = 96 miles. 1 / 4 inch represents 8 miles, 1 / 8 inch represents 8 / 2 = 4 miles because 1 / 8 is half of 1 / 4. If 1 / 8 inch represents 4 miles, 3 / 8 of an inch represents 3 * 4 = 12 miles. This means 3 3 / 8 inches on the map translate to 96 + 12 = 108 miles. The answer is 108.
Question: Maisie and Donna dropped off flyers for a neighborhood clean-up day at houses around their neighborhood. Maisie walked down the shorter left street and dropped off 33 flyers. Donna took the long right street on her bicycle and dropped off five more than twice as many flyers as Maisie. How many flyers did Donna drop off?
Answer: Twice as many flyers as Maisie is 33 * 2 = 66 flyers. Donna dropped off five more than that, so she dropped off 66 + 5 = 71 flyers. The answer is 71.
