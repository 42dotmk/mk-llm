Traditional gender roles exist due to a combination of biological, social, and cultural factors that have evolved over thousands of years. There are several reasons for the development and persistence of these roles, which include evolutionary biology, division of labor, social constructs, and historical practices.

1. Evolutionary biology: One reason for the existence of traditional gender roles is evolutionary biology. Males and females in various species, including humans, have evolved different physical traits and abilities that influence their roles in society. For example, males tend to be larger and have greater physical strength, making them more effective in tasks requiring physical power and endurance. Females, on the other hand, are better equipped for childbirth and caring for young offspring due to their reproductive systems and biologically driven nurturing instincts.

2. Division of labor: As human societies developed, the division of labor became more and more essential for survival and progress. Roles and responsibilities were apportioned based on physical abilities, skills, and resources. Men were generally better suited for hunting, fishing, and protecting the group from external threats, while women were responsible for gathering food, caring for children, and managing the household. This division of labor ensured greater specialization and efficiency in performing necessary tasks, and it subsequently reinforced traditional gender roles.

3. Social constructs: Traditional gender roles are also shaped by sociocultural factors and norms that perpetuate particular expectations and behaviors. Throughout history, societies have created specific roles for men and women, which often reflect prevailing belief systems, values, and religious practices. In many cultures, men are seen as the providers and protectors, while women are typically responsible for nurturing and maintaining the family unit. Over time, these social constructs become ingrained in the collective consciousness and continue to be passed down through generations, further cementing traditional gender roles.

4. Historical practices: Many societies have longstanding practices and customs that uphold traditional gender roles. For example, property inheritance and lineage were often traced through the male bloodline, granting men greater economic power and influence. Women, on the other hand, were often denied education, the right to work (outside the home), own property, or participate in political processes, which further reinforced their subordinate status and traditional roles.

To answer the second question, traditional gender roles were determined by a combination of factors, including evolutionary biology, societal needs for the division of labor, sociocultural constructs, and longstanding historical practices. These factors have continuously interacted to establish the roles and expectations associated with each gender.

Regarding the multi-choice problem, I would say that these questions are connected but not the same:

(ii) yes.

While both questions explore the origin and existence of traditional gender roles, the first question seeks to understand why they exist, and the second question asks how they were determined. The answers to both questions are interrelated, but they address different aspects of the broader issue of gender roles in societies.
