Plot:

Set in the not-so-far future, the story is based in a dystopian city dominated by severe air pollution, causing respiration issues for a majority of the population. Our protagonist, Yamashita, is an intelligent yet introverted astrophysicist, searching for a solution to save the city. Yamashita is known to have a rare gift: through his dreams, he often uncovers complex mysteries and puzzles that are seemingly impossible to solve.

As Yamashita relentlessly dwells in his thoughts, he encounters Mimiko, a teenager afflicted with a severe respiratory condition. Mimiko's family struggles to provide her persistent supply of clean oxygen through inhalers. Knowing that exposure to the polluted air can cause a fatal outcome, Yamashita becomes emotionally connected to Mimiko and her plight, vowing to save her and countless others like her.

As Yamashita's curiosity grows, so too does the frequency of his recurring dreams. In the mysterious realm of his dreams, Yamashita begins to uncover pieces of a forgotten technology — ancient machinery that once perpetuated a pollution-free environment. Driven by his mission, Yamashita delves deeper into his dreams, unearthing feasible links between the forgotten technology and a possible solution to the city's air pollution crisis.

As Mimiko's health deteriorates, Yamashita's dreams become more vivid and crucial. Within the dreams, he converses with an enigmatic scientist, Dr. Alma, who was a pioneer of the forgotten technology. Together, they dive into the fascinating world of science, where time is a mere illusion, and they commence a daring journey to rediscover the secret machinery and save the city.

Meanwhile, in the waking world, Yamashita battles against the manipulative forces controlling the city's energy sources. These powerful individuals are driven by greed and are invested in maintaining an environmentally harmful status quo, as they are profiting from selling inhalers and oxygen cylinders to the inflicted population.

As the connection between Yamashita and Dr. Alma in the dream world strengthens, they come closer to recreating the life-saving technology. With the assistance of like-minded allies, Yamashita works tirelessly to create a device that will generate a sustainable supply of clean air for the city.

While one epic battle unfolds in the dream world seeking the truth, another occurs in reality, fighting against those who endanger the lives of thousands.

In the climax of the film, the two worlds collide, culminating in the activation of the groundbreaking clean-air device. The machine purifies the air and nullifies the pollution, bringing life and vitality back to the city. As the oxygen levels soar, Mimiko's health drastically improves. As she takes deep, clear breaths, the smile on her face signifies the relief from her lifelong struggle for survival.
