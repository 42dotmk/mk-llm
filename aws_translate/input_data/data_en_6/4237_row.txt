Q: Janet is considering two options to retile her bathroom. The turquoise tiles cost $13/tile and the purple tiles cost $11/tile. If Janet needs to tile two walls that measure 5 feet by 8 feet and 7 feet by 8 feet, and each square foot of wall takes 4 tiles, how much will Janet save by buying the purple tiles instead of the turquoise ones?
A: First find the area of the first wall: 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet. Then find the area of the second wall: 7 feet * 8 feet = 56 square feet. Then add the areas of the two walls to find the total area: 40 square feet + 56 square feet = 96 square feet. Then divide the number of square feet by the number of tiles per square foot to find the total number of tiles needed: 96 square feet * 4 tiles / square foot = 384 tiles. Then find the difference in cost per tile: $13 / tile - $11 / tile = $2 / tile. Then multiply the number of tiles by the cost difference per tile to find the total cost difference: $2 / tile * 384 tiles = $768. The answer is 768.
Question: Dawn earns 48,000 a year in 12 equal monthly payments. Each month, she saves 10% of her salary. How much does she save each month?

[Question]Monica and Sheila are twins. Their mother gave them $50 and told them to buy some toilet paper and spend the remainder on groceries. The toilet paper cost $12. They bought apples, butter, eggs, and a large ham for twice the cost of the toilet paper. Since they still had some leftover money, they called their mother and she gave them permission to buy whatever they wanted for themselves as long as they shared the money evenly. They saw some boots they really liked, but a pair of boots costs 3 times the amount they had left. How much more would Monica and Sheila each have to add of their own money to buy two pairs of boots?
[Answer]The groceries cost $12 x 2 = $24. Including the toilet paper, Monica and Sheila had already spent $12 + $24 = $36. This means that they had $50 - $36 = $14 left to spend on themselves. However, the boots cost $14 x 3 = $42 per pair. Two pairs of boots would cost $42 x 2 = $84. They need another $84 - $14 = $70 to buy two pairs. Each of them needs to add another $70 / 2 = $35. The answer is 35.
