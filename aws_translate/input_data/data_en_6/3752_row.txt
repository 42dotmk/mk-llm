Q: Lucy works in a pet shop. She can clean 2 aquariums in 3 hours. If Lucy is working 24 hours this week, how many aquariums could she clean?
A: We know how many aquariums Lucy can clean in a 3 - hour increment. This week, Lucy will work for 24 / 3 = 8 increments. Lucy can clean 2 aquariums per increment, so she can clean 2 x 8 = 16 aquariums. The answer is 16.
Question: Jon's laundry machine can do 5 pounds of laundry at a time. 4 shirts weigh 1 pound and 2 pairs of pants weigh 1 pound. If he needs to wash 20 shirts and 20 pants, how many loads of laundry does he have to do?
Answer: The shirts weigh 20 / 4 = 5 pounds. The pants weigh 20 / 2 = 10 pounds. So he needs to do 10 + 5 = 15 pounds of laundry. So that would take 15 / 5 = 3 loads of laundry. The answer is 3.
[Question]Andrew is having two of his friends over for a sleepover. For one friend, Brian, he asks his mother to buy 3 donuts. He asks for his other friend, Samuel, to get the same. A day before the sleepover Andrew ends up inviting two more friends and asks his mother to buy them the same amount of donuts. Just in case, Andrew’s mother wants to buy one more donut for each of Andrew’s friends. Andrew’s mother is going to buy the same amount of donuts for Andrew as everybody else. How many donuts will Andrew’s mother need to buy?
[Answer]Andrew is having 4 friends over who will get 3 donuts each, 4 x 3 = 12 donuts total. Andrew’s mother wants to get 1 extra donut for each of Andrew’s friends, 3 donuts + 1 extra = 4 donuts for each of Andrew's friends. Andrew’s mother is buying 12 + 4 extra donuts for Andrew’s friends = 16 total donuts. Andrew’s mother is also going to get 3 + 1 extra donut for Andrew = 4 donuts. Andrew’s mother will need to buy 16 donuts for Andrew’s friends + 4 donuts for Andrew = 20 total donuts. The answer is 20.

Question: Amanda is figuring out how many bags of grass seed she needs to buy to cover a new lot the city is turning into a park. The lot measures 120 feet by 60 feet. One section that measures 40 feet by 40 feet will be covered with concrete, and the rest needs to be covered in grass seeds. Each bag of grass seeds covers 56 square feet. How many bags of grass seeds does Amanda need?
Answer: First find the area of the lot by multiplying the width and the length: 120 ft * 60 ft = 7200 sq ft. Then find the area of the square covered in concrete: 40 ft * 40 ft = 1600 sq ft. Then subtract the concrete area from the total area to find the grassy area: 7200 sq ft - 1600 sq ft = 5600 sq ft. Finally, divide this area by the area each bag covers to find the number of bags: 5600 sq ft / 56 sq ft / bag = 100 bags. The answer is 100.
