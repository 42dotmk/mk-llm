he quickly opted to change his clothes before the stubborn stain had a chance to set. But the sight of the spreading oil stain reminded Nick of a childhood memory when his mom was preparing fried chicken for dinner. A similar mishap had happened, and she had soaked the shirt in vinegar and hand-washed the grease out. Although the evening recently took an expected turn, Nick felt a wave of nostalgia wash over him, grateful that he had the opportunity to revisit the past briefly.

Unwilling to let the oil stain ruin his pleasant memory, Nick dashed to his room to find a clean shirt. Knowing the stain would be harder to remove the longer it lingered, he also grabbed a small bowl and filled it with vinegar. After soaking the shirt in the solution, he set it aside and changed into a fresh one. 

As the comforting smell of dinner wafted through the air, Nick turned his attention back to the task at hand: preparing a meal for his old friend, Justin. The two were inseparable growing up, and their lives intertwined on so many levels. They knew each other's likes and dislikes, which made cooking dishes that suited both of their tastes a breeze. This time, Nick opted for a mouthwatering Italian feast consisting of creamy mushroom fettuccine Alfredo topped with grilled chicken, served with delicious garlic ciabatta, and a summer tomato-arugula salad on the side.

The preparation required a bit more focus and diligence than he anticipated, noting that his pan was still sizzling from the earlier oil spill. A sigh escaped his lips as he wiped the pan clean and started over, ensuring that the oil was at the right temperature this time.

However, despite the minor setback, Nick carried on, fueled by the happy memories of cooking together with his friend Justin. Recounting their youthful culinary adventures and the satisfaction of sharing a homemade meal, he focused on the warmth that the memory stirred within him. It gave him the motivation he needed to finish the dinner preparations.

Meanwhile, Justin was on his way to Nick's apartment and couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation. Reuniting with his oldest friend made him reflect on their journey as friends and the valuable time they spent growing side by side. Both of them had come a long way, each pursuing different careers and settling in various parts of the world. But their bond remained strong, and they always managed to pick up where they left off.

Upon seeing each other, the two old friends embraced warmly—a hug filled with memories and unspoken words. They exchanged stories and caught up on each other's lives, reminiscing about the times they shared while growing up. Over the delightful Italian feast, Nick and Justin rediscovered their incredible connection, spoke about their individual accomplishments, and shared heartaches, dreams, and future plans.

As the evening wound down to a close, they found comfort in the knowledge that, despite the passage of time, the bond between them remained unbroken. Despite the various turns and bends their individual lives had taken, the memory of sharing time together in the kitchen solidified the roots of their friendship. Settling down on the couch in Nick's cozy apartment, they returned to their respective roles—as if no time had passed—laughing and pondering life's joys and challenges together, deep into the night.
