Title: Gilani Rejects US Agreements on Drone Attacks, Calls for Respect of Pakistan's Sovereignty

Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani has made it clear that there is no agreement between the United States and Pakistan regarding drone attacks, which have contributed to rising militancy in the region. Gilani's statement comes amid escalating tensions between the two countries and global skepticism over Pakistan's commitment to combating militancy. The Prime Minister has urged US President Barack Obama to respect Pakistan's sovereignty and consider alternative approaches to address militancy.

In a recent interview, Prime Minister Gilani stated that no such agreement exists between the United States and Pakistan, in response to questions about US drone strikes in the country. Gilani voiced his concerns that the missile strikes are fueling militancy by uniting militants and local tribes in the region. Unsanctioned attacks carried out by the US military within Pakistan's borders have led to mounting tensions between the two nations, raising questions about the state of their relationship and the efficacy of drone strikes.

Gilani dismissed Western skepticism regarding Pakistan's commitment to fighting militancy within its borders. He emphasized that the Pakistani government is determined to eradicate extremism and has made substantial efforts in this regard, including initiating counter-terror operations, working closely with international partners, and improving intelligence sharing. However, he also highlighted the need for a more effective and coherent strategy that respects Pakistan's sovereignty and addresses the underlying social, economic, and political factors that contribute to militancy.

Citing concerns that drone attacks are undermining Pakistan's efforts to fight extremism, Gilani urged President Obama to reconsider the US approach in order to foster a healthier and more respectful relationship between the two countries. The Prime Minister pointed out that unilateral, unauthorized strikes violate Pakistan's sovereignty and create resentment among the local population, which could potentially drive moderates towards extremism. This ultimately makes it more challenging for the government to address the root causes of militancy and maintain stability within the nation.

Gilani's comments come at a time when the US-Pakistan relationship is under considerable strain. The situation has been further exacerbated by high-profile incidents, such as the killing of Osama bin Laden in a covert US operation on Pakistani soil, as well as numerous drone attacks that have caused significant civilian casualties. Pakistan has repeatedly voiced its displeasure at these developments and has been demanding a more respectful and collaborative approach.

In conclusion, the Pakistani Prime Minister's statements underline the need for the United States to rethink its approach towards drone attacks and take into consideration the wider implications these actions have on the region's security landscape. As both nations seek to maintain a strong partnership in the ongoing fight against extremism, it is increasingly important for the United States to respect Pakistan's sovereignty and work alongside its government to develop mutually acceptable strategies that address the challenges of militancy without further undermining their relationship.
