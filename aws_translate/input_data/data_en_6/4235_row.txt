[Question]Dexter filled 3 fewer plastic boxes with football cards than basketball cards. He filled 9 boxes with basketball cards and each box has 15 cards. For the boxes with football cards, he filled each box with 20 cards. How many cards does Dexter have in total?
[Answer]Dexter have 9 x 15 = 135 basketball cards. He filled 9 - 3 = 6 plastic boxes with football cards. So, he has 6 x 20 = 120 football cards. Therefore, Dexter has 135 + 120 = 255 cards in total. The answer is 255.
Q: Elliott drew a right-angle triangle on his book. It had a base of 4 inches, a height of 3 inches and a certain length of the hypotenuse. What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?
A: Since the hypotenuse of a triangle is found by the square root of the base squared plus the height squared. The square of the base of the first triangle is 4 * 4 = 16 square inches. The square of the height of the first triangle is 3 * 3 = 9 square inches. The sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16 + 9 = 25. The square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is âˆš25 = 5 inches. Since the perimeter of a triangle is found by adding the sides of the triangle, the base and height of the triangle sum up to 3 + 4 = 7 inches. If you add the hypotenuse of the triangle the perimeter of the triangle becomes 7 + 5 = 12 inches. The answer is 12.
Question: Zoe goes to the store to buy soda and pizza for herself and her 5 family members. Each bottle of soda costs half a dollar and each slice of pizza costs $1. Before she leaves her house she takes just enough money to pay for her purchase. How much money did Zoe take?
Answer: Zoe is going to buy pizza and soda for 5 people + 1 person = 6 people. For 6 sodas, Zoe will pay 6 sodas * $0.5 / soda = $3. For 6 slices of pizza, she will pay 6 slices * $1 / slice = $6. Adding the price of the soda and pizza, Zoe paid $3 + $6 = $9. The answer is 9.
[Question]Grant spends $200.00 a year to have the newspaper delivered daily to his house. Juanita buys the newspaper daily. Monday through Saturday, she spends $0.50 and on Sunday she spends $2.00. How much more money does Juanita spend buying the newspaper yearly than Grant?
[Answer]Monday through Saturday Juanita buys the paper for $0.50 so that's 6 * $0.50 = $3.00. She spends $2.00 for Sunday and $3.00 for the other 6 days so she spends $2 + $3 = $5.00 for the newspaper weekly. Over 52 weeks she spends 52 * $5 = $260.00. Juanita spends $260.00 on the newspaper for the year and Grants spends $200.00 a year so Juanita spends $260 - $200 = $60.00 more. The answer is 60.
Q: Kyle can lift 60 more pounds this year, which is 3 times as much as he could lift last year. How many pounds can Kyle lift in all?
A: Since Kyle can lift 60 more pounds and that is 3 times what he could do before, that means that last year Kyle could lift 60 pounds / 3 = 20 pounds. Kyle can now lift 60 pounds + 20 pounds he could lift last year = 80 pounds. The answer is 80.
