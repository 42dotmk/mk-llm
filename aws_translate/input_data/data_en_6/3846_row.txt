From creating custom looks for A-list celebrities to designing avant-garde ensembles for high-octane, fiercely competitive runway shows, the designers’ skills will be tested relentlessly. And, as is to be expected from a television fashion show, there will be just as much action and suspense behind the scenes as on the catwalk, with rivalries, alliances, and plenty of fierce fashion drama.

As for the grand prize, the victor will have the unparalleled opportunity to join Rihanna's illustrious style team and gain access to the corridors of the music and fashion industries. The winner will not only have the ear of one of the world's leading style mavens but will also receive an incredible platform to launch their own successful fashion career.

Rihanna's "Styled to Rock" combines the glamour, creativity, and excitement of today's fast-paced fashion industry with the thrill of a high-stakes competition.
