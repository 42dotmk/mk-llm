[Question]One student on a field trip counted 12 squirrels. Another counted a third more squirrels than the first student. How many squirrels did both students count combined?
[Answer]The second student counted 12 / 3 = 4 more squirrels than the first student. The second student counted 12 + 4 = 16 squirrels. Together, the first and second student counted 12 + 16 = 28 squirrels combined. The answer is 28.
Q: Edna made cookies for all of her neighbors and left the cookies outside for them to take. She made 150 cookies so her 15 neighbors could get 10 cookies each. However, the neighbor who arrived last told Edna there were only 8 cookies left. Edna thinks it was Sarah who took too many cookies. If all the other neighbors took the correct amount of cookies, how many cookies did Sarah take?
A: Sarah and the final neighbor took the wrong amount, which means that 15 neighbors – 1 Sarah – 1 final neighbor = 13 neighbors took 10 cookies each. This is a total of 13 neighbors * 10 cookies = 130 cookies taken by the first 13 neighbors. There were only 8 cookies left, so that means the first 13 neighbors and Sarah took a total of 150 – 8 = 142 cookies. So Sarah must have taken 142 – 130 = 12 cookies. The answer is 12.
Question: In a spelling contest held in her school, Drew got 20 questions correct, winning her the competition. She got six questions wrong, and her competitor Carla got 14 questions correct, and twice as many questions wrong as the number of questions Drew got wrong. If each competitor was asked a different question, how many questions were asked in the competition?
Answer: Since Drew got 20 questions right and 6 wrong, she was asked 20 + 6 = 26 questions. Carla got twice as many questions wrong as Drew got, a total of 2 * 6 = 12 questions wrong. The total number of questions that Carla was asked is 12 + 14 = 26. Altogether, there were 26 + 26 = 52 questions that were asked in the contest. The answer is 52.
[Question]In four years, Annika will be three times as old as Hans. If Hans is now 8 years old, how old is Annika now?
[Answer]In four years, Hans will be 8 + 4 = 12 years old. Then Annika will be 12 * 3 = 36 years old. So Annika right now is 36 - 4 = 32 years old. The answer is 32.
Q: On his farm, Mr. Mathews has goats and sheep in the ratio of 5:7. He decides to sell half of the goats at $40 each and 2/3 of the sheep at $30 each. How much money does he make from the sale of the animals if the total number of sheep and goats on the farm is 360?
A: The total ratio of goats and sheep on the farm is 5 + 7 = 12. The fraction that represents goats from the total ratio is 5 / 12, and since there are 360 goats and sheep on the farm, the number of goats is 5 / 12 * 360 = 150. The number of sheep on Mr. Mathews's farm is 360 - 150 = 210. Mr. Mathews sold 1 / 2 * 150 = 75 goats. If each goat went for $40, the total amount of money Mr. Mathews made from the sale of his goats is 75 * $40 = $3000. He also sold 2 / 3 * 210 = 140 of the total sheep on his farm. The income from the sale of the sheep is 140 * $30 = $4200. From the sale of goats and sheep, Mr. Mathews made $4200 + $3000 = $8600. The answer is 7200.
