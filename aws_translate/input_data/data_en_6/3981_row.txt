Question: Cara has 60 marbles in a bag. 20 of them are yellow, half as many are green, and the remaining marbles are equally divided between red and blue. If Cara picks a marble at random, what are the odds it's blue (expressed as a percentage)?
Answer: First find the number of green marbles: 20 yellow marbles / 2 = 10 green marbles. Then find how many marbles are either red or blue: 60 marbles - 20 yellow marbles - 10 green marbles = 30 marbles. Divide this number in half to find how many marbles are blue: 30 marbles / 2 = 15 blue marbles. Finally, divide the number of blue marbles by the total number of marbles and multiply by 100 to find the percentage chance of getting a blue marble: 15 marbles / 60 marbles * 100 = 25%. The answer is 25.
[Question]Tim has to go to the doctor for a sporting injury. He gets an MRI which costs $1200. The doctor needs to examine it for 30 minutes and charges $300 per hour. There is also a $150 fee just for being seen. Insurance covered 80% how much did he pay?
[Answer]The doctor charged 300 / 2 = $150. So the total cost was 150 + 150 + 1200 = $1500. The insurance covered 1500 * .8 = $1200. So he paid 1500 - 1200 = $300. The answer is 300.
Q: Jerry charges $20 to pierce someone's nose and 50% more to pierce their ears. If he pierces 6 noses and 9 ears, how much money does he make?
A: First find how much more Jerry charges to pierce one person's ears than their nose: $20 * 50% = $10. Then add that amount to the cost of nose piercing to find the total cost: $10 + $20 = $30. Then multiply that price by the number of ears he pierces to find his total earnings from ear - piercing: $30 / ear * 9 ears = $270. Then multiply the price of nose - piercing by the number of noses pierced: $20 / nose * 6 noses = $120. Then add the money from nose - piercing to the money from ear - piercing to find Jerry's total income: $120 + $270 = $390. The answer is 390.
Question: Janice needs to go to watch a movie in 2 hours. before she could leave, she needs to finish her homework which takes 30 minutes; clean her room which takes half as long as her homework; walk the dog which takes 5 minutes more than making homework; take out the trash which takes 1/6 of the time it takes her to do the homework. How many more minutes do Janice have left before the movie starts?
Answer: Janice takes 30 / 2 = 15 minutes to clean her room. It takes 30 + 5 = 35 minutes for her to walk the dog. It takes her 30 x 1 / 6 = 5 minutes to take out the trash. So, it will take 30 + 15 + 35 + 5 = 85 minutes to do all those chores. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, then 2 hours is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes. Thus, Janice still has 120 - 85 = 35 minutes left before the movie starts. The answer is 35.
[Question]Betsy is sewing a quilt. The quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side. Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together. How many more squares does she need to sew together?
[Answer]The quilt is made of 16 squares on one side and 16 on the other so 16 + 16 = 32 squares total. She has already sewn 25% of the quilt so she has sown together .25 * 32 = 8 squares. Betsy still has 32 - 8 = 24 more squares to sew together. The answer is 24.
