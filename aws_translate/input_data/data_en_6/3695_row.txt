[Question]An online newspaper had listed 100 visitors in October. The number of visitors in November increased by 15%. There were 15 more visitors in December than in November. What is the total number of visitors for these three months?
[Answer]There was an increase of 100 x 15 / 100 = 15 visitors in November. So, the number of visitors in November was 100 + 15 = 115. In December, the number of visitors was 115 + 15 = 130. Therefore, a total of 100 + 115 + 130 = 345 visitors listed in these three months. The answer is 345.
Q: Jake's dad can drive the distance from their house to the water park in 30 minutes. He spends half that journey driving 28 miles per hour and the other half driving 60 miles per hour on the highway. If Jake can bike 11 miles per hour, how many hours will it take him to bike to the water park?
A: First find how long half Jake's dad's trip is: 30 minutes / 2 = 15 minutes. Then convert the minutes to hours: 15 minutes * 1 hour / 60 minutes = .25 hours. Now find how far Jake's dad travels at 28 miles per hour: .25 hours * 28 miles per hour = 7 miles. Then find how far Jake's dad travels at 60 miles per hour: .25 hours * 60 miles per hour = 15 miles. Now add those distances to find the total distance to the water park: 7 miles + 15 miles = 22 miles. Now divide the total distance by Jake's speed to find how long it takes him: 22 miles / 11 miles / hour = 2 hours. The answer is 2.
Question: The ratio of the amount of money Cara, Janet, and Jerry have is 4:5:6. If the total amount of money they have is $75, calculate the loss Cara and Janet will make if they combine their money to buy oranges and sell them at 80% of the buying price.
Answer: The sum of the ratios representing the amount of money the three has is 4 + 5 + 6 = 15. If the total amount of money they have is $75, the amount of money Cara has represented by the fraction 4 / 15 is 4 / 15 * $75 = $20. Similarly, the amount of money Janet has represented by the fraction 5 / 15 of the total ratio is 5 / 15 * $75 = $25. Combined, Cara and Janet have $20 + 25 = $45. If Cara and Janet buy goods worth $45 and sells them at 80% of the buying price, the selling price of the goods will be 80 / 100 * $45 = $36. Since they bought the goods at $45 and sold them at $36, Janet and Cara would run at a loss of $45 - $36 = $9. The answer is 9.
[Question]There are 8 men at a yoga studio with an average weight of 190 pounds and 6 women with an average weight of 120 pounds. What is the average weight of all 14 men and women?
[Answer]The total weight for the 8 men is 8 men * 190 pounds per man = 1520 pounds. The total weight for the 6 women is 6 women * 120 pounds per woman = 720 pounds. The total weight for 14 men and women is 1520 pounds + 720 pounds = 2240 pounds. The average weight per person is 2240 pounds / 14 men and women = 160 pounds. The answer is 160.
