1. Choosing the right pine nuts
Before you begin the process of shelling pine nuts, ensure that you have chosen the right variety of pine nuts. Pine nuts are the edible seeds of pine trees, and not all pine tree seeds are fit for consumption. The most commonly consumed pine nuts come from the species Pinus pinea (European stone pine) and Pinus koraiensis (Korean pine). These nuts have a softer shell and are significantly larger than other pine tree seeds, making them easier to shell and more enjoyable to eat.

2. Harvesting pine cones
Pine nuts are found inside the pine cones, so you'll first need to harvest pine cones from the chosen pine tree. The optimal time for harvesting pine cones is late summer or early autumn when the cones are still green and unopened. This ensures that the seeds inside are protected and have not yet been released.

3. Drying and storing the pine cones
Once you have gathered the pine cones, spread them out on a flat surface, such as a tray or a perforated container, and store them in a cool and dry place. Over the next few weeks, the pine cones will dry out and begin to open up, making it easier to access the pine nuts inside. Make sure to turn the pine cones periodically to ensure even drying. You may also want to cover the pine cones with a mesh or cloth to prevent insects or rodents from reaching them.

4. Extracting pine nuts from the pine cones
When the pine cones have sufficiently dried and opened up, you can begin the process of extracting the pine nuts. You can either do this manually or use a specialized tool, such as a nutcracker or pliers. Start by gently shaking the pine cones, as some of the nuts may fall out easily. For the remaining nuts, use your fingers or a tool to remove them from the crevices within the pine cone.

5. Soaking the pine nuts
Once you have collected all the pine nuts, soak them in warm water for at least 30 minutes. This will make the shell slightly softer and easier to crack open. It also helps to remove any dust, dirt, or debris from the pine nuts.

6. Cracking the shell and extracting the pine nut
Now that your pine nuts are soaked and the shells are softened, you are ready to crack them open. There are several ways to do this, but the most common methods are using a nutcracker, a pair of pliers, or a mortar and pestle. Place the pine nut between the jaws of the nutcracker or the pliers, and apply gentle pressure until the shell cracks. Make sure not to apply too much force, as this can damage the nut inside. Once the shell is cracked, carefully remove it and extract the pine nut.

7. Cleaning and enjoying the shelled pine nuts
After shelling the pine nuts, you may notice some residual pieces of the shell or a thin brown skin around the nut. You can remove these using your fingers or a small brush. Once the pine nuts are cleaned, they can be eaten raw, toasted, or incorporated into a variety of recipes, including salads, pesto, and baked goods.

In summary, the most logical next event after gathering unshelled pine nuts would be to go through the process of drying and storing the pine cones, extracting the pine nuts, soaking the nuts, cracking the shells, and cleaning the shelled pine nuts before using them in various culinary applications. This process, although lengthy, will result in fresh and delicious pine nuts that can be enjoyed in a variety of ways.
