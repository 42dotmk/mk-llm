[Question]When it rains, the three holes in the garage roof leak water at different rates. The largest hole leaks at a rate of 3 ounces of water per minute. The medium-sized hole leaks water at one-half the rate of the largest hole. And the smallest hole leaks water at a rate of one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole. When it rains, what is the combined amount of water, in ounces, that leak from all three holes over a 2-hour time period?
[Answer]The medium - sized hole leaks at a rate of one - half that of the largest hole, or 3 / 2 = 1.5 ounces per minute. The small - sized hole leaks at a rate of one - third that of the medium - sized hole, or 1.5 / 3 = 0.5 ounces per minute. Combined, the three holes leak at a rate of 3 + 1.5 + 0.5 = 5 ounces per minute. Since one hour is 60 minutes, two hours is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. In total, over the two hours, the three holes will leak a combined 120 * 5 = 600 ounces of water. The answer is 600.
Q: Jimmy decides to make sandwiches for a picnic. He makes 8 sandwiches in total, using two slices of bread each. How many packs of bread does he need to buy to make these sandwiches, assuming he starts with no bread and each pack has 4 slices of bread in it?
A: First, we need to determine how many slices of bread Jimmy will use to make the sandwiches. We determine this by performing 8 * 2 = 16 slices of bread needed. We then divide the number of slices needed by the number of slices per bread pack, performing 16 / 4 = 4 packs of bread needed. The answer is 4.
Question: Four classmates were comparing their ages based on their birth month. They found out that Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese while Therese is 5 months older than Aivo. Then, Leon is 2 months older than Aivo. How much older in months is Jolyn than Leon?
Answer: Jolyn is 2 + 5 = 7 months older than Aivo. Since Leon is 2 months older than Aivo, then Jolyn is 7 - 2 = 5 months older than Leon. The answer is 5.
[Question]Manex is a tour bus driver. He has to drive 55 miles to the destination and drive going back to the starting point on a different way that is 10 miles farther. If he can drive 1 mile for 2 minutes and stayed 2 hours at the destination, how long will it take the bus driver to do the entire tour in hours?
[Answer]The bus traveled 55 + 10 = 65 miles going back to the starting point. So, the bus traveled a total of 55 + 65 = 120 miles. It took 120 x 2 = 240 minutes to travel. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, then the bus traveled for 240 / 60 = 4 hours. Therefore, the entire tour took 4 + 2 = 6 hours. The answer is 6.
Q: Hayden has a tank with a small hole in the bottom. The tank starts with 40 gallons of water. It loses 2 gallons of water per hour. Hayden does not add any water for the first two hours. He adds 1 gallon of water to the tank in hour three. He adds three gallons of water to the tank in the fourth hour. How much water is left in the tank at the end of the fourth hour?
A: Over the four hours, the tank loses 2 * 4 = 8 gallons of water. Hayden adds a total of 1 + 3 = 4 gallons of water. At the end of the four hours, there is 40 - 8 + 4 = 36 gallons of water left in the tank. The answer is 36.
