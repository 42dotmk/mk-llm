Question: The Rotary Club is holding its annual fundraising Omelet Breakfast, with tickets sold in advance. The tickets come in different price levels, for young children, older children, adults, and seniors. This year they sold 53 small children tickets, 35 older children tickets, 75 adult tickets, and 37 senior tickets. To figure out how many eggs they need to buy, the club estimates that small children can eat a half omelet, older children can eat a whole omelet, adults will eat two omelets, and seniors will eat one and a half omelets. Just to be on the safe side, they get enough eggs to make 25 extra omelets. If they use 2 eggs for each omelet, how many eggs will they need to buy?
Answer: They'll need to make an estimated 0.5 * 53 = 26.5 omelets for small children. They'll need to make an estimated 1 * 35 = 35 omelets for older children. They'll need to make an estimated 2 * 75 = 150 omelets for the adults. And they'll need to make an estimated 1.5 * 37 = 55.5 omelets for the seniors. Along with the 25 extra omelets they'll make as a buffer, they will need enough eggs for 26.5 + 35 + 150 + 55.5 + 25 = 292 omelets. So they will need 2 * 292 = 584 eggs. The answer is 584.
[Question]Bob runs 6 miles per hour. His friend Jim runs at 9 miles per hour. If Bob has a 1 mile head-start, how many minutes will it take before Jim catches him?
[Answer]Bob runs .1 miles per minute because 6 / 60 = .1. Jim run at .15 miles per minute 9 / 60 = .15. We know that .1(Number of Minutes) + 1 = .15(Number of Minutes). Therefore 1 = .05(Number of minutes). Therefore (Number of minutes) = 20 because 1 / .05 = 20. The answer is 20.
Q: Jolene and Phil have four children, each with the same birthday. They gave birth to their first child exactly 15 years ago. They gave birth to their second child exactly one year after the birth of their first child. They gave birth to their third child on the fourth birthday of their second child. Two years after the birth of their third child, they gave birth to their fourth child. How old, in years, is their fourth child?
A: Their 1st child was born 15 years ago, and therefore is 15 years old. Their 2nd child was born 1 year after their 15 - year - old child, and therefore is 15 - 1 = 14 years old. Their 3rd child was born 4 years after their 14 - year - old child, and therefore is 14 - 4 = 10 years old. Their 4th child was born 2 years after their 10 - year - old child, and therefore is 10 - 2 = 8 years old. The answer is 8.
Question: In 3 years, Jayden will be half of Ernesto's age. If Ernesto is 11 years old, how many years old is Jayden now?

[Question]Irene earns $500 if she works for 40 hours a week and gets an extra $20 for every hour of overtime. If she worked 50 hours last week, calculate her total income.
[Answer]If Irene worked 50 hours last week, the total number of hours counting as overtime is 50 - 40 = 10 hours. Since she's given $20 for every hour of overtime, she earned 10 * $20 = $200 in overtime. Her total income, including the overtime, is $500 + $200 = $700. The answer is 700.
