No, these two questions are not the same but they do share similarities. Both situations involve unrequited emotions and challenges in establishing a connection with the desired individual. Let me address each situation separately and offer some guidance for both.

For the first question, when you have a crush on a guy but he treats you like you're invisible, it can be a disheartening experience. Here are some steps to navigate this situation:

1. Reflect on your feelings: Before taking action, make sure that your crush is someone you genuinely like and are not just attracted to because of trivial reasons such as appearance or popularity.

2. Build your confidence: Work on building your self-esteem and confidence, as this will help you feel more comfortable around your crush and make it easier to have engaging conversations with him.

3. Reach out: Find an opportunity to initiate a conversation with him about common interests or shared activities. This could be a group assignment, a mutual friend, or even an event you both attended.

4. Don't force it: If you find the guy is not responsive or interested in engaging with you, do not force the connection. It's essential to respect his space and boundaries, and it’s possible that he may not be reciprocating your feelings.

5. Focus on yourself: Invest time in yourself, and pursue activities that make you feel happy and confident. This will not only help you develop as an individual, but it will also make you more attractive to potential romantic interests.

For the second question, when you have a crush on a girl who likes someone else, especially a person who might not be a suitable partner, the situation can be challenging. Here are some steps to help you deal with this:

1. Be supportive: Be a supportive and understanding friend. You never know when she might realize the incompatibility with the other person or decide to seek a healthier relationship.

2. Open up about your feelings: When the time is right and you feel confident enough, consider sharing your feelings with her. It's crucial not to pressure her to make a decision, but instead, let her know how you feel and be prepared for any outcome, as she might not feel the same way about you. 

3. Focus on self-improvement: Dedicate time to improving yourself. Develop interests, enhance your confidence, and learn new skills. This will increase her chances of seeing you as a potential romantic partner if her current situation doesn't work out. 

4. Respect her decision: If she remains committed to the other person, it's essential to accept her decision and respect her choices, even if you do not agree with them. Maintaining a friendship might be challenging, so don’t be afraid to create some distance to allow yourself to heal and move forward. 

5. Move on if necessary: Work on overcoming your feelings for her if she ultimately does not reciprocate your emotions. There are plenty of other people out there who may be an even better fit and share your feelings.

In both situations, it is essential to remember that you cannot force someone to like you, and it's vital to respect their feelings, choices, and boundaries. Furthermore, focusing on self-improvement and self-worth can help you navigate these situations and, ultimately, find someone who genuinely appreciates and reciprocates your feelings.
