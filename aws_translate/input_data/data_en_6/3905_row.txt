[Question]Reese joined a Pinterest group where members contributed an average of 10 pins per day. The group owner deleted older pins at the rate of 5 pins per week per person. If the group has 20 people and the total number of pins is 1000, how many pins would be there after Reese had been a member for a month?
[Answer]In a day, the total number of new pins is 10 * 20 = 200. There will be 30 * 200 = 6000 new pins after a month. The total number with old pins present is 6000 + 1000 = 7000 pins. If the owner deletes five pins every week, the total number of deleted pins in a week is 5 * 20 = 100 pins. After a month, the number of deleted pins will be 100 * 4 = 400. The number of pins after the old pins are deleted is 7000 - 400 = 6600 pins. The answer is 6600.
Q: When Hannah was 6 years old, her age was double the age of her sister July. Now, 20 years later, if July's husband is 2 years older than her, how old is he?
A: July was 6 / 2 = 3 years old when Hannah was 6. Now, July is 3 + 20 = 23 years old. July's husband is 23 + 2 = 25 years old. The answer is 25.
Question: UF got into the national championship. For them to get into the championship, they scored a total of 720 points during their previous 24 games. In the championship game, however, their opponent was much stronger than any other team they had previously gone against and they scored 2 points less than half as much as they had previously scored in each of the 24 games. Their opponent only lost by 2 points. How many points did their opponent score?
Answer: They scored an average of 720 / 24 = 30 points in their previous games. Half that many would be 30 / 2 = 15 points. So in the finals, they scored 15 - 2 = 13 points. Their opponent thus scored 13 - 2 = 11 points. The answer is 11.
[Question]A parking area near Peter's house is 4 stories tall. There are 4 open parking spots on the first level. There are 7 more open parking spots on the second level than on the first level, and there are 6 more open parking spots on the third level than on the second level. There are 14 open parking spots on the fourth level. How many open parking spots are there in all?
[Answer]The number of open parking spots on the second level is 4 spots + 7 spots = 11 spots. The number of open parking spots on the third level is 11 spots + 6 spots = 17 spots. There are 4 spots + 11 spots + 17 spots + 14 spots = 46 open parking spots in all. The answer is 46.
Q: Jerry is refilling the duck pond in his backyard during a drought. The pond can hold 200 gallons of water. Jerry's hose can normally pump 6 gallons/minute, but due to drought restrictions, it can only pump 2/3rds as fast right now. How many minutes will it take Jerry to fill his pond?
A: First find the current rate the hose pumps by multiplying its normal rate by 2 / 3: 6 gallons / minute * 2 / 3 = 4 gallons / minute. Then divide the number of gallons in the pond by the number of gallons pumped each minute to find how many minutes filling the pond takes: 200 gallons / 4 gallons / minute = 50 minutes. The answer is 50.
