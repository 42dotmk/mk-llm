Scurvy, a disease caused by a deficiency in vitamin C (ascorbic acid), is a condition primarily associated with malnutrition resulting from inadequate intake or absorption of vitamin C. The statement "In infants, scurvy is sometimes referred to as Barlow's disease, named after Sir Thomas Barlow, a British physician who described it," is accurate, as Barlow's disease is an alternative name specifically for the infantile form of this condition.

Vitamin C plays a crucial role in the body's collagen synthesis (a structural protein found in connective tissues) and contributes to various essential metabolic reactions. When the body does not receive an appropriate amount of this vital nutrient, it leads to several complications, including scurvy.

While scurvy is more commonly associated with sailors during the Age of Exploration, who endured long voyages without access to fresh fruits and vegetables, it can still occur in modern times. The risk factors for developing scurvy include inadequate dietary intake of vitamin C, alcoholism, elderly individuals living in isolation, restrictive diets, malabsorption syndromes, and certain underlying health conditions that hinder the absorption of nutrients.

The symptoms of scurvy vary based on the stage and severity of the disease but typically start with fatigue, weakness, and irritability. As the condition progresses, one may develop more severe manifestations such as:

1. Anemia: Vitamin C deficiency impairs iron absorption, leading to reduced red blood cell production.
2. Swollen, bleeding gums: The weakened collagen synthesis causes gums to become soft, inflamed, and vulnerable to bleeding.
3. Bruising and petechiae: Blood vessels become fragile due to the lack of collagen, resulting in tiny spots of bleeding under the skin called petechiae and increased susceptibility to bruising.
4. Joint pain and swelling: Weakness in the connective tissues contributes to pain and inflammation in the joints.
5. Poor wound healing: The impaired collagen synthesis hinders the healing process of injuries and other skin issues.
6. Hyperkeratosis: Dry, thickened, bumpy skin that develops as a result of abnormal keratin production due to vitamin C deficiency.

In infants specifically, scurvy (Barlow's disease) can present with unique symptoms such as pseudoparalysis, during which the baby appears reluctant to move uncomfortable limbs due to pain and tenderness in bones and joints. Other signs include irritability, poor weight gain, and delayed developmental milestones.

Diagnosis and treatment of scurvy involve assessment of the patient's dietary and clinical history, physical examination, and sometimes blood tests to measure vitamin C levels. Treatment is simple and effective, consisting of oral or intravenous vitamin C supplementation until symptoms resolve, followed by maintaining a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables to ensure adequate vitamin C intake and prevent the recurrence of scurvy.

In conclusion, scurvy is a disease resulting from a deficiency of vitamin C, with symptoms varying based on its stage and severity. Barlow's disease is an accurate term for the infantile form of scurvy, and Sir Thomas Barlow was instrumental in describing this condition. To avoid scurvy, it is crucial to consume a balanced diet with adequate amounts of vitamin C found primarily in fruits and vegetables.
