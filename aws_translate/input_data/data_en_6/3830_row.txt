[Question]Mrs. Smith wanted to buy wears worth $500. She went to a boutique with the $500 but by the time she had picked out everything she liked, she realized that she would need two-fifths more money than she had. If the shop owner gave her a discount of 15%, how much more money will she still need?
[Answer]Two fifths of $500 is (2 / 5) * $500 = $200. She needed $200 more than $500 which is $200 + $500 = $700. 15% of $700 is (15 / 100) * $700 = $105. She was given a $105 discount so she has to pay $700 - $105 = $595. She would still need $595 - $500 = $95. The answer is 95.
Q: John works a job that offers performance bonuses. He makes $80 a day and works for 8 hours. He has the option of working hard to earn the performance bonus of an extra $20 a day, but the extra effort results in a 2-hour longer workday. How much does John make per hour if he decides to earn the bonus?
A: First, we need to determine the length of John's workday if he decides to earn the bonus. We do this by performing 8 + 2 = 10 hours for his workday. Next, we need to determine his overall pay. We do this by performing 80 + 20 = 100 dollars a day. We then determine John's hourly rate by dividing his pay by the number of hours worked, performing 100 / 10 = 10 dollars an hour. The answer is 10.
Question: Ariella has $200 more in her son's saving account than Daniella has in her son's savings account. Ariella's account earns her simple interest at the rate of 10% per annum. If Daniella has $400, how much money will Arialla have after two years?
Answer: If Ariella has $200 more in her son's saving account than Daniella has, then she has $400 + $200 = $600. If she earns an interest of 10% in the first year, her savings account increases by 10 / 100 * $600 = $60. In the second year, she earns the same amount of interest, which $60 + $60 = $120. The total amount of money in Ariella's account after two years is $600 + $120 = $720. The answer is 720.
[Question]Wickham is throwing a huge Christmas party. He invites 30 people. Everyone attends the party, and half of the guests bring a plus one (one other person). He plans to serve a 3-course meal for the guests. If he uses a new plate for every course, how many plates does he need in total for his guests?
[Answer]The number of guests that bring a plus one is 30 / 2 = 15 guests. The total number of guests at the party, including the plus ones, is 30 + 15 = 45 guests. Since there are 3 courses, Wickham will need 45 * 3 = 135 plates. The answer is 135.
Q: Once a week, it takes Kitty 5 minutes to pick up toys and straighten the living room. It takes another 20 minutes to vacuum the living room floor, seating and drapes. She spends 15 minutes cleaning the windows and 10 minutes dusting the furniture. After 4 weeks, how long has Kitty spent cleaning just the living room?
A: 5 minutes for picking up toys, 20 minutes to vacuum, 15 minutes on windows and 10 minutes on furniture is 5 + 20 + 15 + 10 = 50 minutes. After 4 weeks, she has spent 4 weeks * 50 minutes / week = 200 minutes cleaning the living room. The answer is 200.
