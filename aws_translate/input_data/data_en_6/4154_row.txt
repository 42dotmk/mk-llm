Reasoning and answer: Because it is cheaper to buy the packs of 5, the teacher should satisfy the 11 students who want the vampire theme with 2 packs of 5 and 1 individual bag. This will cost the teacher 2 * 3 + 1 * 1 = $7. Similarly, the 14 students who want a pumpkin - themed bag can be satisfied by 2 packs of 5 and 4 individual bags at a cost of 2 * 3 + 4 * 1 = $10. Therefore, the teacher must spend 7 + 10 = $17.
The answer: 17

Question: An elementary school teacher is making Halloween goodie bags for her class. She wants the bags to be personalized, so she surveys her students asking whether they'd like a vampire-themed bag or a pumpkin-themed bag. Of her 25 students, 11 indicate they want the vampire-themed bag and 14 indicate they want the pumpkin-themed bag. The store the teacher shops at sells packs of 5 of each theme at a price of $3 per package, as well as individual bags of each theme at a price of $1 each. What is the least amount of money the teacher can spend on the bags if she buys every student the theme they requested?

Sonny gave 12 + 9 + 7 = 28 boxes of cookies. Therefore, he was left with 45 - 28 = 17 boxes of cookies.

Reasoning and answer: Saly saves 1 / 2 * $6 / day = $3 / day. Since each year have 365 days, the total amount of money Sally will save in a year is $3 / day * 365 days / year = $1095 / year. Bob saves 1 / 2 * $4 / day = $2 / day. The total amount of money Bob will have saved in a year is $2 / day * 365 days / year = $730 / year. In total, Sally and Bob would have saved $730 + $1095 = $1825.
The answer: 1825
