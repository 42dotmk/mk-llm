Title: Standard Oil's Intensive Control over the Oil Industry in 1911

Introduction:

In 1911, the oil industry was dominated by one major player – Standard Oil, mired in controversy and eventually leading to a landmark Supreme Court decision which would break up the company, forever changing the face of the oil industry. However, prior to this break-up, Standard Oil had a firm grip over various areas, controlling more than 80 percent of the share in some regions. In this article, we will explore the regions in which Standard Oil held its massive share and discuss the context behind the company's significance.

Step 1: Setting the Stage - Dominance of Standard Oil:

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Standard Oil, founded by John D. Rockefeller, was the largest and most powerful oil corporation in the United States. The company pioneered various business tactics such as horizontal and vertical integration, which allowed them to control key elements of the oil industry, from drilling to refining and marketing. By using aggressive strategies such as undercutting prices and buying out competitors, Standard Oil secured its dominion over the industry.

Step 2: Identifying the Regions:

In 1911, prior to the company’s break-up, Standard Oil controlled more than 80 percent of the market shares in several areas. These regions included:

  a. New England: Standard Oil's control over this northeastern area of the United States was paramount, and it was able to assemble a strong distribution network across the region.
  
  b. Mid-Atlantic States: Home to many prominent oil refineries and processing facilities, the importance of this region cannot be overstated. Standard Oil owned numerous refineries and storage facilities in this region, allowing them to efficiently process and distribute oil.
  
  c. The Midwest: The Midwest states provided fertile ground for Standard Oil to both consolidate its operations and expand its reach in the industry. With a vast network of pipelines and distribution centers, the company maintained a stronghold on the oil market in this region.
  
  d. The Pacific Coast: With its access to international markets, the West Coast was an essential asset for Standard Oil. The company had control over a significant portion of refining capacity, ensuring a strong influence on pricing and market availability in the area.

Step 3: Understanding the Impact of Standard Oil's Control

In these areas, the dominance of Standard Oil led to a near-monopoly on the oil and kerosene market, enabling them to dictate prices and control supply. This eventually drew the attention of regulators, who were increasingly concerned about the power Standard Oil wielded in the American economy. Consequently, it was this intensive control that ultimately led to the antitrust suit against the company.

Conclusion:

In 1911, Standard Oil's influence stretched far and wide, with a control of more than 80 percent of the share in key regions such as New England, Mid-Atlantic States, the Midwest, and the Pacific Coast. This monopolistic grip on the market was eventually challenged by antitrust regulators, culminating in the landmark Supreme Court decision to break up Standard Oil. The case of Standard Oil serves as a significant historical lesson in the importance of market competition and the consequences of unchecked corporate power.
