Question: Darryl is an inventor who just designed a new machine. He had to pay $3600 for the parts to construct the machine, and $4500 for the patent he applied for once he built it. If the machine sells for $180, how many machines does Darryl need to sell to break even after the costs?
Answer: Darryl paid 3600 + 4500 = $8100 in costs for the parts and patent. Thus, Darryl needs to sell 8100 / 180 = 45 machines to break even. The answer is 45.
[Question]Two runners are competing in a 10-mile race. The first runs at an average pace of 8 minutes per mile, while the second runs at an average pace of 7 minutes per mile. After 56 minutes, the second runner stops for a drink of water. For how many minutes could the second runner remain stopped before the first runner catches up with him?
[Answer]After 56 minutes, the second runner has traveled 56 / 7 = 8 miles. Similarly, the first runner has traveled 56 / 8 = 7 miles. Therefore, the two runners are 8 - 7 = 1 mile apart when the second runner stops. Thus, the second runner can stop for a maximum of 8 minutes, which is the amount of time it takes the first runner to travel 1 mile. The answer is 8.
Q: Jimmy is setting up a garden. He has three plots: one plot for green beans, one plot for carrots, and one plot for corn. Each corn plant produces 5 times as many servings of veggies as each carrot, and each green bean plant produces half as many servings as each corn plant. If each carrot produces 4 servings of vegetables, and each plot has 9 plants, how many servings of vegetables is Jimmy growing?
A: First, find how many servings one corn plant produces by multiplying the number of carrot servings by 5: 4 servings * 5 = 20 servings. Then find how many servings one green bean plant produces by dividing the number of corn servings by two: 20 servings / 2 = 10 servings. Now multiply the number of servings per carrot plant by the number of carrot plants: 4 servings / plant * 9 plants = 36 servings. Do the same for corn: 20 servings / plant * 9 plants = 180 servings. And do the same for green beans: 10 servings / plant * 9 plants = 90 servings. Now add up the servings for all three types of plant: 36 servings + 180 servings + 90 servings = 306 servings. The answer is 306.
Question: A hand-crank pencil sharpener can sharpen one pencil every forty-five seconds. An electric version can sharpen one in twenty seconds. How many more pencils can the electric sharpener sharpen than the hand-crank sharpener in six minutes?
Answer: A minute is 60 seconds, so 6 minutes is 6 * 60 = 360 seconds. A hand - crank sharpener can sharpen 360 / 45 = 8 pencils in 6 minutes. An electric sharpener can sharpen 360 / 20 = 18 pencils in 6 minutes. Therefore, an electric sharpener can sharpen 18 - 8 = 10 more pencils than a hand - crank in 6 minutes. The answer is 10.
[Question]Marco uses a fifth of an ounce of dry tea leaves to brew his morning cup of tea each day. He buys tea leaves in boxes of 28 ounces. How many weeks of daily tea does Marco get from a box?
[Answer]Marco gets 28 / 1 / 5 = 28 * 5 = 140 cups of tea from a box. At 7 days a week, Marco gets 140 / 7 = 20 weeks of daily tea from a box. The answer is 20.
