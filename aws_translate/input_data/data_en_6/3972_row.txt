Title: Scotland's new Lord Advocate Asserts Inconceivability of No Fatal Accident Inquiry into M9 Crash

Scotland's newly appointed Lord Advocate has adamantly stated that it would be "inconceivable" not to explore a Fatal Accident Inquiry (FAI) into the tragic M9 roadway accident that resulted in the death of two individuals. The statement echoes the severity of the issue and the dire need for enquiry and justice considering the grievous outcome of the mishap. 

The M9 crash, a serious event that shocked the nation, claimed two lives and raised significant questions about road safety and emergency response protocols in Scotland. Emphasizing its gravity, the Lord Advocate fostered the necessity of a comprehensive FAI that dives deep into the circumstances leading to the accident, its management, and the subsequent impact.

As the chief legal officer of Scotland, the Lord Advocate's statements carry substantial weight and rightfully so, given the harrowing nature of the loss. By calling it inconceivable not to undergo an FAI, he stresses on the state's responsibility to thoroughly investigate accidents of such magnitude to ensure accountability, establish preventive measures, and most importantly, bring justice to the victims.

Fatal Accident Inquiries in Scotland are significant public investigations, not dissimilar to coroner's inquests in other jurisdictions. They are managed by the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service and overseen by a Sheriff in a public hearing. The purpose of these inquiries is usually to ascertain the circumstances of a significant incident and make recommendations to prevent such unfortunate occurrences in the future.

Referring to the accident as a critical and sad incident, the Lord Advocate’s assertiveness towards conducting an FAI is likely to be instrumental in the decision-making process, which is due to the substantial authority his position holds in Scottish legislation. 

Moreover, the family members and friends of the victims have eagerly been awaiting a detailed investigation into the incident. From their perspective, an FAI will not only shed light on what went wrong but also ensure that measures are put in place to prevent future occurrences of such untoward incidents.

The impact of the M9 crash extends to all of Scotland and beyond, invigorating a nationwide conversation about road safety, emergency services, and their efficacy. A successful Fatal Accident Inquiry would provide the blueprint for handling similar incidents in the future more effectively, highlighting areas of improvement in road safety regulations and emergency response.

In conclusion, the Lord Advocate's assertive stance underscores the integral role of Fatal Accident Inquiries in ensuring a transparent, comprehensive exploration into such serious incidents. It also hints at the relentless pursuit of justice for the victims of the M9 accident and a dedicated endeavor to bolster road safety and emergency responses in Scotland. His unwavering stance reinstates both the Scottish government’s seriousness in reviewing and improving its accident response mechanism as well as its commitment towards the safety and wellbeing of its citizens. Upcoming developments around the FAI regarding the M9 crash are thus worthy of close attention, as Scotland aims to build a safer, more secure environment for all its denizens.
