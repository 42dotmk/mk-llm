a). Being healthy isn't always fun.

It was a cold winter evening. Snow fell gently onto the ground outside, covering the desolate landscape in a pristine white sheet. Lexi had loved winter for as long as she could remember. She mostly enjoyed indulging in her favorite activities – hot cocoa and curling up with a blanket in front of the fireplace. But this year was different.

Lexi had made a resolution to be healthier. It had been a challenging year for her, filled with stress, tempting fast food, and skipped workouts. She knew she needed to make a change for the sake of her body and mind. But she also knew that changing habits was not going to be an easy ride. One of the hardest things to let go of was her undying love for sugary treats, such as her all-time winter comfort – hot cocoa.

This evening, Lexi found herself craving that rich and sweet concoction she had always adored. She knew she could not stop herself altogether from having it, but she was determined to modify the recipe to make it healthier. To do so, she decided not to add any sugar.

As she stirred her cocoa concoction on the stove, she felt a pang of sadness at the thought of omitting the sweet ingredient that she was sure would transform the otherwise mundane liquid into a delightful and warming treat. But she had vowed to keep her resolution. With a deep breath, Lexi poured herself a steaming mug of unsweetened cocoa.

The anticipation was palpable as Lexi took her first sip. Her taste buds were met with a strong and bitter taste, completely devoid of the sweetness she had been accustomed to. Her heart sank, and she realized being healthy wasn't always fun.

Despite the bitterness of her first sip, Lexi knew she needed to give it a chance. Over time, as she continued to drink the healthier version of her beloved hot cocoa, she noticed that her taste buds began to adjust. The bitterness transformed into a rich chocolate-y flavor that she started to appreciate.

One day, complex layers of cocoa flavor seemed to reveal themselves to her as if they were always hidden beneath the sticky sweetness that she once craved. Lexi found her palate opening up to a whole new world of flavors that she had never experienced before.

Lexi's journey to living a healthier lifestyle was not easy, as she had to battle with temptation and make tough choices. However, the newfound appreciation for healthier options made her realize that although being healthy isn't always fun, the payoff is worth it.

As she persevered and continued incorporating healthier choices into her life, Lexi found herself feeling stronger, more energetic, and happier than ever. The self-discipline required to make these changes bled into other aspects of her life, leading her to develop an inner strength that she never knew she had.

The winter evenings continued to be filled with warmth and comfort, but instead of indulging in unhealthy treats, Lexi learned to find enjoyment in the simple pleasures of life that supported her well-being. This newfound resilience allowed her to approach future winters - and life - with a sense of optimism and confidence that she could face any hurdle and come out stronger on the other side. And while she never lost her love for sweet treats, she also never forgot the lesson she learned about the importance of balance and self-discipline on her journey to a healthier, happier life.
