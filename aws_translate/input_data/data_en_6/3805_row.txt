Q: Mark bought a shirt, pants, and shoes for $340. What is the price of the pants knowing that the price of a shirt is three-quarters of the price of the pants and that the price of a shoe is ten dollars more than the price of the pants?
A: Let X be the price of the pants. The price of the shirt is 3 / 4 * X. The price of the shoes is X + 10. The total amount paid is X + 3 / 4 * X + X + 10 = $340. Combining like terms we get X * 11 / 4 + 10 = $340. Subtracting 10 from both sides we get X * 11 / 4 = $330. Dividing both sides by 11 / 4 we get X = $120. The answer is 120.
Question: Diana gets 30 minutes of video game time for every hour she reads. Her dad decided to raise her reward by 20%. Diana read for 12 hours this week. How many more minutes of video game time will she get as a result of her raise?
Answer: Diana’s raise was 20% of her 30 - minute video game time, or 0.20 x 30 minutes = 6 minutes. Diana is now making 30 minutes + 6 - minute raise = 36 minutes for every hour she reads. Diana read 12 hours x 36 minutes of video game time, so she received 432 minutes of video game time after her raise. Before, if Diana read 12 hours x 30 minutes of video game time, she would have received 360 minutes. The amount she received after her raise, 432 minutes – 360 minutes at her old rate = 72 more minutes after her raise. The answer is 72.
[Question]Five years ago, there were 500 old books in the library. Two years ago, the librarian bought 300 books. Last year, the librarian bought 100 more books than she had bought the previous year. This year, the librarian donated 200 of the library's old books. How many books are in the library now?
[Answer]Last year the librarian bought 300 + 100 = 400 books. Thus, there were 500 + 300 + 400 = 1200 books as of last year. Therefore, there are 1200 - 200 = 1000 books now in the library. The answer is 1000.
Q: The rim of a standard basketball hoop is 10 feet above the ground. Additionally, most experts will say that a player must be able to reach at least 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball. Suppose a basketball player is 6 feet tall and can reach 22 inches above their head using the wingspan of their arms. How high must this player be able to jump to reach 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball?
A: In inches, the height of the rim is 10 * 12 = 120 inches. Thus, the height that the player needs to be able to reach is 120 + 6 = 126 inches. Without jumping, the player can reach their height plus an additional 22 inches, or a total of 6 * 12 + 22 = 94 inches. Therefore, the player needs to jump 126 - 94 = 32 inches to reach the height required to dunk a basketball. The answer is 32.
Question: There are 4 carriages in a train and each carriage has 25 seats. If each carriage could accommodate 10 more passengers, how many passengers would fill up 3 trains?
Answer: If each carriage had another 10 seats, each carriage would have 25 + 10 = 35 seats. The train comprises of 4 carriages and each carriage now has 35 seats; therefore a train has 35 x 4 = 140 seats. 3 trains with 140 seats each in total can take up 3 x 140 = 420 passengers. The answer is 420.
