Genre: Courtroom Drama, Mystery, Thriller

Plot:

Act I:

Meet Sarah Matthews, a young, passionate attorney fresh out of law school. She's just landed her first major case as a part of the public defender's office - defending a man convicted of a high-profile murder case that's been all over the news. The man, Jack Thompson, is a struggling mechanic who has been convicted of the brutal murder of a successful businessman, Henry Robertson.

The movie begins with the reading of the original verdict – a life sentence for Jack. The jurors, the judge, and the prosecution seem satisfied with the result, and Jack's wife, Emma, and daughter, Sophie, weep inconsolably. Sarah, however, believes that Jack is innocent and vows to appeal the decision.

Act II:

Sarah starts her quest for the truth. She teams up with a seasoned private investigator, Michael "Mickey" O'Reilly, to take a deeper dive into the case. While re-investigating the evidence and going through the trial transcripts, Sarah discovers inconsistencies in key testimonies and missing links. The duo uncovers new evidence that points to a possible cover-up by the deceased businessman's relatives and business partners – they had motive and opportunity to frame Jack for the murder.

As they dig deeper, Sarah and Mickey face threats and warnings from powerful individuals with their interests at stake. Sarah starts to unravel the buried secrets of the powerful Robertson family, finding out that Henry was involved in a series of illegal deals that involved money laundering and tax evasion, which would explain the motive for murder.

Act III:

Despite the mounting evidence, Jack's case appeal seems like a long shot. Sarah knows she needs much more credibility to face the influential prosecution team. She decides to take a risk and approaches the jurors who originally sentenced Jack, one by one, attempting to convince them of Jack's innocence and the new evidence. This intense strategy and her unwavering determination gradually affect the jurors' perspectives, raising doubts in their minds.

Meanwhile, Mickey is hot on the trail of the mastermind behind the conspiracy and discovers one of the jurors from the original trial, who has a connection with the Robertson family. He collects the final pieces of evidence to prove misconduct in the original trial.

Act IV:

The day finally comes where the appellate court hears Jack's case, with Sarah representing him. In a passionate and powerful closing argument, she lays out the new evidence, exposes the conspiracy, and presents the misconduct of the jury in the original trial.

The appellate court, moved by the evidence and the determination of Sarah's pursuit of justice, overturns the original verdict in a unanimous decision, declaring Jack innocent. The true perpetrators behind the murder and cover-up are arrested, and Jack is finally able to go home to his family.

The movie ends with Sarah, her reputation established as an unyielding advocate for justice, taking up another case, while Mickey continues his work as a private investigator, the two remaining good friends and upholding their shared values.

Unanimous Justice showcases the power of determination, the quest for the truth in the face of adversity, and the resilience of justice when good people stand up for what's right.
