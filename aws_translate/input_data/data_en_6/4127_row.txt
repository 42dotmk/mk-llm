First question: How anonymous is the Anonymous hacker group?

The Anonymous hacker group is a loosely affiliated and decentralized international network of "hacktivists" who perform cyberattacks on various government, corporate, and individual targets. Due to its organization structure and how participants operate within it, the group is somewhat anonymous. However, the degree of anonymity varies depending on several factors:

1. Modes of communication: Anonymous participants often use secure and encrypted communication channels, such as encrypted email services, virtual private networks (VPNs), proxy servers, or the Tor Network. These methods make it more difficult for law enforcement and other entities to track them.

2. Operational security (OPSEC): The anonymity of the hacker group is directly linked to the level of operational security employed by its participants. Those that practice good OPSEC, like using pseudonyms, avoiding sharing personal information, and using secure operating systems like Tails, are more likely to remain anonymous.

3. Skill level of participants: Some participants in Anonymous are highly skilled in computer security, cryptography, and other techniques that help maintain anonymity online. Those with less knowledge in these areas may be more susceptible to being identified.

4. Law enforcement and counterintelligence efforts: Even though Anonymous is somewhat anonymous, participants are not immune to being caught. Many instances have occurred where individuals associated with Anonymous have been arrested, prosecuted, and convicted.

Second question: How is Anonymous (Hacker Group) so successful?

Anonymous' success can be attributed to a combination of factors:

1. Decentralized nature: The group is a loosely connected network without any known official leadership, which makes it difficult for authorities to pinpoint any specific individual or core group responsible for their actions. This decentralized structure also allows for operational flexibility.

2. Collective power: Because Anonymous attracts people from different parts of the world with diverse skills and expertise, the group can tackle a wide range of targets with varying degrees of difficulty. Their collective efforts increase efficiency and effectiveness.

3. Grassroots activism: Anonymous is often motivated by a sense of activism, fighting against perceived injustice, or espousing certain political or social ideologies. This resonates with a wide audience and encourages more people to participate or support their efforts.

4. High-profile targets: The group has successfully targeted high-profile organizations and individuals, such as governments, corporations, and churches, which further amplifies their message and increases public awareness of their actions.

5. Media attention: Anonymous often uses striking visuals, such as the Guy Fawkes mask, and melodramatic language to grab public attention and increase its visibility. This media attention can contribute to the group's success and inspire supporters.

To answer your last question, no, these two questions are not asking the same thing. While both questions deal with the Anonymous hacker group, they address different aspects. The first question focuses on the degree of anonymity that its members can achieve, while the second question explores the reasons behind the group's success.
