Question: Tonya spent $90.00 on art supplies. 4 canvases cost $40.00 and a mixed set of paints cost 1/2 that much. She also spent $15.00 on an easel, and the rest of the money on paintbrushes. How much money did she spend on paintbrushes?
Answer: The canvases cost $40.00 and she spent half that amount on paint so she spent 40 / 2 = $20.00 on paint. She spent $40.00 on canvases, $20.00 on paint and $15.00 on an easel so she spent 40 + 20 + 15 = $75.00. She spent $90.00 total and her other purchases totaled $75.00 so she spent 90 - 75 = $15.00 on paint brushes. The answer is 15.
[Question]Stephanie is planning dinners to cook for the week and needs to figure out how much of each ingredient she should buy at the grocery store. She is making three recipes that call for lower sodium soy sauce as a main ingredient. One bottle of lower sodium soy sauce holds 16 ounces. There are 8 ounces in 1 cup. The first recipe Stephanie is going to cook calls for 2 cups of lower sodium soy sauce. The second recipe calls for 1 cup. The third recipe calls for 3 cups. If Stephanie can only buy 1 whole bottle of soy sauce no matter how much she needs exactly, how many bottles of lower sodium soy sauce should Stephanie buy to allow for all three recipes?
[Answer]First, Stephanie needs to figure out how many cups of soy sauce she needs total, 2 cups + 1 cup + 3 cups = 6 cups total of lower sodium soy sauce. Then Stephanie needs to figure out how many ounces are in 6 cups of lower sodium soy sauce, 6 x 8 ounces each cup = 48 total ounces of lower sodium soy sauce. Next Stephanie needs to figure out how many bottles of soy sauce to purchase to get 48 ounces, where 1 bottle has 16 ounces, 48 / 16 = 3 bottles of lower sodium soy sauce. The answer is 3.
Q: Marian's pending credit card balance is $126.00. She puts $60.00 worth of groceries on her card and half that amount in gas. She returned some bath towels for $45.00. What's the new balance on her credit card?
A: Her gas is half the price as her $60.00 groceries so that's 60 / 2 = $30.00 in gas. Her card has a balance of $126.00 and she added $60.00 in groceries and $30.00 in gas for a total of 126 + 60 + 30 = $216.00. Her balance is $216.00 and she returns $45.00 worth of merchandise for a new balance of 216 - 45 = $171.00. The answer is 171.
