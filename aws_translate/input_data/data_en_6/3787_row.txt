Cells contain genetic instructions, which are essential for the functioning, development, and reproduction of living organisms. Genetic instructions are encoded in the form of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) molecules located within the nucleus of each cell. Various structures within cells such as chromosomes and genes carry these genetic instructions and transmit them from one generation to another.

Here is a detailed explanation of the answer choices provided:

1. Cells: As mentioned previously, cells contain genetic instructions in the form of DNA. In organisms such as animals, plants, and fungi, these instructions are stored in the nucleus of the cell. In prokaryotes (organisms without a nucleus), DNA is found in a circular form within the cytoplasm of the cell. 

2. Cows: As a living organism, cows also consist of cells that each contain genetic instructions in the form of DNA. Similar to other animals, the genetic instructions in cows are vital for their growth, development, and reproduction. However, cows themselves do not "contain" genetic instructions; instead, it is the cells in their body that hold these instructions.

3. Oak: An oak tree is also a living organism consisting of cells with genetic instructions. In the case of plants, genetic information stored within cells plays a role in controlling various functions, growth, and reproduction.

4. Embryos: An embryo is the early stage of development in multicellular organisms, such as humans and animals. Cells within the embryo contain genetic instructions in the form of DNA, which influences the development and differentiation of various cell types that eventually become tissues and organs.

5. Pollen: Pollen grains are important for the reproductive process of flowering plants, as they facilitate the transfer of genetic material from the male reproductive structures (anthers) to the female reproductive structures (pistil). Pollen grains contain cells with genetic instructions that will contribute to the formation of seeds, ensuring the next generation of plants.

6. Flowers: Flowers are the reproductive organs of flowering plants, containing both male and female parts crucial for their reproduction. The cells within the flowers also have genetic instructions that contribute to the formation of pollen and seeds, as well as ensure proper growth and maintenance of the flower.

7. Seeds: Seeds are the matured ovules of plants, containing embryonic plant tissue and the potential to develop into a new plant. The cells within the seeds also hold genetic instructions that guide the growth, development, and reproduction of the resulting plant.

8. Legumes: Legumes refer to a family of plants, including beans, peas, lentils, and many others. Similar to other living organisms, the cells within legume plants contain genetic instructions necessary for their various life processes, reproduction, and overall survival.

In summary, the answer to the question "What contains genetic instructions?" is cells. Cells within living organisms such as animals (cows), plants (oak, flowers, seeds, and legumes), reproductive cells (embryos, pollen), and many other organisms contain the genetic instructions required for development, growth, and reproduction. These essential instructions are encoded within DNA molecules located within the nucleus or cytoplasm of cells.
