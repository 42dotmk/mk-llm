The use of Java:

Java is a widely-used programming language because of several reasons that make it an attractive choice for developers and businesses alike. Here are some of the key reasons why organizations and individuals prefer using Java:

1. Platform Independence: Java's "Write Once, Run Anywhere" approach allows Java applications to run on any device or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This makes it easier for developers to create applications that work consistently across multiple platforms. 

2. Object-Oriented: Java is an object-oriented programming language (OOP) which enables developers to build modular, reusable and easily maintainable code. OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction allow for increased flexibility and improved overall code quality.

3. Strong Community Support: Java has a large, active, and well-established community of developers, which means that developers have access to a wealth of resources, including libraries, frameworks, tutorials, and support forums. This strong community makes it easier for developers to find solutions to common challenges and continuously improve their skillset.

4. Robustness and Security: Java offers built-in security features such as runtime exception handling and type checking that help prevent errors and protect applications from vulnerabilities. The Java security model restricts access to critical system resources, ensuring that applications are less prone to system crashes, data corruption, and security breaches.

5. Scalability and Performance: Java is designed to support the development of high-performance and highly scalable applications. Features such as multithreading, automatic memory management, and Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation help to enhance application performance, ensuring that Java applications can effectively handle varying workloads and maintain responsiveness in an efficient manner.

6. Rich Ecosystem: Java’s ecosystem includes numerous open-source libraries and frameworks, which help speed up the development process and allow developers to focus on business logic rather than developing every component from scratch. Some popular Java frameworks include Spring, Hibernate, and Apache Struts, among others.

In The Revenant, why did the tribes attack Glass and his company when they didn't kidnap the chief’s daughter?

In the movie "The Revenant," the Arikara tribe attacks Glass and his company after mistakenly believing that the fur trappers had kidnapped the daughter of their chief, Elk Dog. This attack is the result of a misunderstanding and a series of unfortunate events that led the tribe to believe that their chief's daughter, Powaqa, had been abducted by the trappers. The tribespeople's primary goal throughout the movie is to recover Powaqa and protect their community, leading to several conflicts and aggressive encounters with Glass and his companions.

It is important to note that these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question focuses on the use of Java as a programming language and the benefits it provides, while the second question is about a specific plot point in the movie "The Revenant." The two questions address completely unrelated topics, and as such, they cannot be considered paraphrases of each other.
