In order to fully address the question, let us first break down the given process and the perturbation hypothesis:

Process:
1. Bacteria enters the body.
2. Bacteria enters the bloodstream.
3. Cells in the body are attacked.
4. Cells are killed.
5. Different kinds of sickness are formed.

Perturbation Hypothesis: Suppose bacteria is on the skin and is ingested, will it have any effect on the aforementioned process?

To answer this question, we must first understand how bacteria on the skin might enter the body when ingested and if it has direct or indirect effects on the process.

When bacteria are present on the skin, they can be transferred to the mouth and ingested via direct touch (e.g., touching the mouth with unwashed hands) or indirect contact (e.g., through contaminated food or utensils). Once the bacteria have been ingested, they will enter the gastrointestinal tract, specifically the stomach and intestines. The stomach has a highly acidic environment with a pH around 1.5 to 3.5. This acidic environment functions as a defense mechanism against ingested pathogens, as it can kill or deactivate many types of bacteria.

However, some bacteria are capable of surviving in this harsh environment, such as Helicobacter pylori, which is responsible for stomach ulcers. Other bacteria may be present in food that has been stored or prepared improperly, leading to foodborne illnesses.

Once the bacteria have survived the stomach's acidity, they can enter the intestinal tract, where they can adhere to the mucosal surfaces or invade the epithelial cells lining the intestines. From here, bacteria may enter the bloodstream either directly, by breaching the intestinal barrier, or indirectly, by producing toxins that can be absorbed into the bloodstream.

The direct access of bacteria into the bloodstream can result in bacteremia -- the presence of bacteria in the blood. This occurrence can potentially lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition as a result of the body's response to an infection, and can progress to septic shock. In these cases, the process described above is affected as bacteria will enter the bloodstream and may attack cells in the body, leading to cell death and the formation of different sicknesses.

Alternatively, the indirect effect of ingested bacteria on the bloodstream can happen when they produce toxins within the gastrointestinal tract that are then absorbed into the bloodstream. These toxins can cause damage to cells and tissues throughout the body, including the liver and kidneys. This pathway also has the potential to affect the process by causing the cells in the body to be attacked, leading to cell death and the development of various illnesses.

In summary, the perturbation hypothesis does have potential direct and indirect effects on the process. When bacteria on the skin are ingested, they might be able to enter the bloodstream either directly by breaching the intestinal barrier, or indirectly by producing toxins that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. This can lead to the body's cells being attacked, cell death, and the subsequent development of different sicknesses. However, it is essential to note that not all ingested bacteria will have these effects, as some pathogens may be killed or deactivated in the stomach's acidic environment or are unable to invade the intestinal barrier.
