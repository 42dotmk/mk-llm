Yes, the perturbation of climate causing less wind and water can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of sedimentary rock formation. If there is a significant decrease in wind and water activities, it can greatly affect the erosion, transportation, and deposition of sediments, which are crucial steps in the formation of sedimentary rocks. 

Direct effects of the perturbation:

1. Reduced erosion: Less wind and water means that there will be a decrease in the erosional forces acting upon rocks. As a result, the rate at which rocks are broken down and sediments are generated will decrease. Without a continuous supply of new sediment, the process of sedimentary rock formation may be slowed or inhibited.

2. Limited transportation: Wind and water are the primary modes of transportation for sediments. A decrease in their activities will limit the movement of sediments, potentially keeping them near their source and not allowing them to be deposited in new locations. The reduction in sediment transportation can also affect the mixing and mingling of different sediment types, which ultimately has an impact on the characteristics of the resulting sedimentary rock.

3. Impeded deposition: With less wind and water to carry sediments, the deposition process could be severely hindered. The deposition of sediments is necessary for the accumulation of layers that eventually become sedimentary rocks. If sediments are not being deposited and piled up, the subsequent compression and cementation processes cannot occur, resulting in limited formations of sedimentary rocks.

Indirect effects of the perturbation:

1. Ecosystem changes: A change in climate that results in less wind and water can have cascading effects on the surrounding ecosystems. For instance, plants might not grow as abundantly in these conditions, which could reduce the amount of organic material available to mix with inorganic sediments. Therefore, the formation of certain types of sedimentary rocks, like those containing high amounts of organic material, could be affected.

2. Altered sedimentary basins: A decrease in wind and water activity may alter the size, depth, and distribution of sedimentary basins, which are important depositional areas for sediments. New basins could form in different locations, or existing basins could change their geometry and sedimentary fill patterns. These changes could impact sedimentary rock formation by altering the depositional environments and the types of sedimentary rocks formed therein.

3. Climate feedback loops: Climate perturbations can lead to various feedback loops in the environment, which may further affect sedimentary rock formation. For example, decreased precipitation may lead to reduced runoff, which in turn might decrease water erosion and sediment transportation. This feedback mechanism could compound the direct effects of the climate perturbation, further reducing sedimentary rock formation.

In conclusion, the hypothesis that climate change causing less wind and water can indeed have significant direct and indirect effects on the process of sedimentary rock formation. The reduction in erosion, transportation, and deposition of sediments would likely result in a decreased rate of sedimentary rock formation and potentially alter the types and locations of sedimentary rocks being formed.
