A. no.

These two questions convey different meanings and scenarios:

1. "What should I do when my crush is my friend?"
   This question is asking for advice on how to handle a situation where the person you have romantic feelings for is also your friend. The main focus is on the person who has the crush, and the uncertainty revolves around how to proceed to maintain the friendship while also exploring the potential for a romantic relationship.

Here's a detailed response:

In this situation, first, it's important to gauge the feelings of your crush, as well as their current relationship status. Try to spend more time with your crush in group settings and observe their behavior. Pay attention to how they interact with you and with others around them. If you notice any signs of attraction, your crush may reciprocate your feelings.

However, be prepared for the possibility that your crush may not share the same feelings for you. This can be difficult, especially since you are friends. You should consider whether you can be content with just being friends or if your romantic feelings will get in the way. Decide if pursuing a romantic relationship is worth potentially damaging an existing friendship.

If you decide to convey your feelings, it's essential to be open and honest with your crush. Choose an appropriate time and place for the conversation, and be prepared to deal with the outcome, whether positive or negative. If they share your feelings, then you can discuss how to move forward. If they don't, try to maintain your friendship and remember that your feelings may fade over time.

Regardless of the outcome, always respect their decision and their feelings.

2. "What can I do if my friend likes my crush?"
   This question pertains to a situation where your friend is interested in the same person you have a crush on. The challenge, in this case, is navigating the feelings of both your friend and yourself, while avoiding potential conflict or hurt feelings.

Here's a detailed response:

First and foremost, communication is key. Talk to your friend about your feelings and gauge their reaction. They may not know that you are also interested in the same person and might be more considerate if they are aware of the situation. Be honest about your feelings, but also express that you value the friendship and don't want it to be affected by the situation.

In the case where both of you are open to pursuing your crush, decide together how to approach the situation. It might involve respectfully competing for the crush's attention or agreeing to let the crush decide between the two of you, if they are interested in both. Although it might be difficult, set your boundaries and ground rules to ensure that no matter the outcome, your friendship remains intact.

Alternatively, if you genuinely care for your friend and their happiness, you might choose to step back and let them pursue your mutual crush. Keep in mind that the right person for you might still be out there, and sacrificing your chance with this particular crush could potentially save your friendship.

Ultimately, each case is unique, and the appropriate course of action depends on your specific situation and friendships. However, in both situations, it is important to prioritize open communication, respect for one another's feelings, and the value of the established connections.
