Title: Milly Dowler Phone Hacking Scandal: A Cowardly and Shocking Breach of Privacy

Introduction:

The shocking revelation that a murdered teenager's phone was hacked has sent shockwaves throughout the nation, prompting widespread outrage and demands for a thorough investigation into the matter. The teenager in question, Milly Dowler, fell victim not only to a harrowing crime, but to an appalling invasion of privacy by the very media who were expected to protect her memory and her family's rights. The recent statements from both the police and Milly Dowler's family have cast a necessary light on the phone hacking scandal and demand a deeper look at this disturbing phenomenon.

Hackers Target Murdered Girl's Phone:

The heinous act of hacking into a murdered girl's phone has been described as "cowardly and shocking" by a representative for the Grant family. Milly Dowler, the tragic victim of this senseless crime, had her mobile phone accessed without authorization by nefarious individuals seeking personal lines of enquiry to report in their publications, or for other more sinister purposes. This disgraceful act raises questions about ethics, privacy, and the extent to which journalists are prepared to go to uncover breaking news, and what the cost is for those who are directly affected.

False Hope Through Phone Hacking:

Milly Dowler's mother, amongst those understandably outraged by the phone hacking scandal, has described the experience of learning about the hacking as one that gave her false hope that her daughter may still be alive. When discovering that a message on her daughter's phone had been deleted, the family initially believed this activity to be by Milly herself, resulting in a surge of hope and optimism that was cruelly and devastatingly short-lived. The realization that their daughter's phone had been hacked added a further layer of heartache and injustice to the family's suffering.

Widespread Phone Hacking Investigations:

Police have revealed a shocking number of phone hacking victims, placing the estimated number of people affected at up to 5,800 individuals. The enormity of this number demands prompt and thorough investigations into those responsible for these breaches of privacy and trust. As the Milly Dowler case demonstrates, the consequences of phone hacking extend far beyond the invasion of privacy and can have real emotional and psychological impacts on those targeted and their loved ones. The journalist community faces a reckoning as the extent of the ethical breaches come to light, with many questioning the very fundamental nature of the industry.

Conclusion:

The Milly Dowler phone hacking scandal has sparked a necessary discourse on privacy invasion and the price of unethical journalistic practices. As the investigation into the 5,800 potential victims continues, the public's faith in the media is put to the test. The consequences for those involved in the scandal will no doubt be severe, and calls for change within the journalistic community are inevitable. However, no amount of change, reflection, or reparation can undo the trauma and pain that the Dowler family experienced due to these despicable hacking actions. It is the hope of a nation that this breach of trust never repeats itself and that victims of crime and their families are shown the respect and privacy they deserve.
