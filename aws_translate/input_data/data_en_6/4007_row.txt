No, these two questions are not the same. They address different topics and contexts. I'll provide detailed answers for both questions:

1. Why didn't Horace Slughorn edit the potions recipes like Snape?

To understand why Horace Slughorn did not edit the potions recipes like Snape, it is essential to consider their characters and roles in the Harry Potter series. Horace Slughorn is the Potions Master and Head of Slytherin House for part of the series. He is known for his love of comfort, his selective associations with people he considers influential or talented, and his adherence to tradition. Slughorn follows potions recipes strictly, as they are presented in textbooks, and he values their established nature. He could also be motivated by the intent not to confuse students with an alternative approach to the potions-making process.

On the other hand, Severus Snape, another Potions Master and Head of Slytherin House, is more innovative and experimental in his methods. In his student years, Snape made modifications to the potions recipes by adjusting the ingredients, quantities, or process in a way that improved the outcomes. He documented these changes in his old potions textbook, and Harry would later rely on these modifications. Snape's approach to potions suggests he valued skill and mastery beyond simply adhering to the instructions.

In summary, Horace Slughorn did not edit the potions recipes like Snape due to differences in their characters, their approaches to potions-making, and their adherence to tradition versus the pursuit of mastery.

2. What are the pros and cons of swimming in underwear?

Pros:
- Accessibility: Swimming in underwear can be more immediately accessible, especially in a spontaneous situation where swimwear isn't available.
- Comfort: Some people may find their underwear more comfortable than swimwear, as they are generally designed for everyday wear and fit.
- Cost efficiency: If you do not have a bathing suit or do not want to invest in one, underwear can be a cost-effective alternative.
- Less restrictive: Underwear can provide a feeling of freedom and reduced restriction, especially in comparison to tight, form-fitting swimwear.

Cons:
- Hygiene: Swimming in underwear can raise hygiene concerns, particularly in public pools, where there may be restrictions on proper swimwear to minimize bacterial contamination.
- Ill-suited fabric: Most underwear is made from materials that were not designed for swimming, such as cotton, which retains water and takes longer to dry than swimwear fabrics.
- Transparency: Wet underwear might become partially transparent. This could make you feel uncomfortable or self-conscious, especially in a public setting.
- Durability: Regular underwear is not meant for swimming and may wear out or degrade more quickly due to the exposure to water and the chlorine or minerals found in swimming pools or other bodies of water.
- Social norms: Swimming in underwear might be viewed as inappropriate or disrespectful in some environments, such as public pools or beaches, due to cultural norms and expectations.

In summary, while swimming in underwear can offer certain benefits like accessibility, comfort, and being less restrictive, it may raise hygiene concerns, be ill-suited for swimming, lead to transparency and durability issues, and potentially violate social norms.
