Title: Atonement of the Unseen

Summary:

	he accidentally witnesses a gruesome murder committed by a menacing assailant in his small Italian village.

	victim, Berti Cavatti, and the assailant they are chasing – all while Gianni grapples with a dark secret
	from his past that has resurfaced.

Plot:
	Act 1:
		Gianni De Luca, an investigative journalist who had fallen into a deep depression after a
		devastating accident, moves to the small Italian village of Cerignola in an attempt to
		reinvent himself. One gloomy night, Gianni decides to take a solitary stroll through the
		woods to gather his thoughts. As he walks through the darkness, he accidentally stumbles
		upon the figure of an assailant hacking local businessman, Berti Cavatti, to death with an axe.

		Though Gianni manages to remain hidden, the assailant gets a brief glimpse of him before escaping.
		The stunned Gianni immediately goes to the police to report the murder, but he's hesitant to
		describe the assailant in fear of retribution. Nevertheless, detective Lia Pellegrini takes on the case.

	Act 2:
		Upon investigation, Gianni and Lia discover that Berti's business was involved in illegal activities,
		and he owed a considerable debt to a powerful crime syndicate. As a result, they speculate that the
		assailant was a hitman hired to take Berti out.

		Despite the risk, Gianni and Lia forge a risky alliance, both seeking justice for Berti. Together,
		they uncover a string of evidence that suggests that the crime syndicate's leader,
		Donato Marino, was responsible for the murder and a prolific human trafficking ring.

		Meanwhile, Gianni starts receiving a series of anonymous threats which indicate that the assailant
		is aware of his involvement in the investigation and is coming for him next. Panicked and fearing
		for his life, Gianni confides in Lia about his past – revealing that his accident, which left him
		disfigured, was a result of an investigation gone horribly wrong.

	Act 3:
		Determined to bring Donato to justice and avenge Berti, Gianni and Lia gather enough evidence
		to incriminate him. As the police set up a sting operation to capture the crime syndicate leader,
		Gianni and Lia are cornered by the menacing assailant in the woods – the same spot where Berti
		was killed.

		Facing imminent danger, Gianni builds up the courage to confront the attacker. In a twist of events,
		it is revealed that the assailant is actually Berti's long-lost brother, Matteo. Driven by a sense of misplaced
		vengeance, Matteo was convinced that Berti was responsible for the death of their sister, who was
		ensnared in the human trafficking ring.

	As the police close in on Donato, Matteo realizes that he has been misled in his quest for vengeance.
	In a climactic battle, Matteo is shot and killed. Lia ultimately arrests Donato and dismantles the human
	trafficking ring.

At the end of the movie, Gianni comes to terms with his scars from the past and finds closure in the
knowledge that his pursuit for justice helped prevent others from sharing Berti's grim fate. He and Lia
		part ways, their alliance having forged a mutual understanding and respect for each other.
