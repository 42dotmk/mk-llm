(1). Jessica was surprised at her termination.

Jessica sat at her desk, scrolling through yet another report destined for her superiors. Her focus never wavered, her determination only growing stronger - after all, she had deadlines to meet and a reputation to uphold. She was known as the most reliable employee in the office. She’d always take on extra work, staying late to get it done. But Jessica also knew her limits. She wasn't one to let others down. She prided herself on her impeccable organizational skills and her ability to manage several tasks at once.

Rebecca, on the other hand, seemed to be the polar opposite. Her workspace was always cluttered with Post-its, loose papers, and half-empty coffee cups. Procrastination seemed to be her modus operandi, leaving work to pile up until the last minute. She was never concerned about deadlines and viewed the strict schedules as guidelines rather than firm times.

Jessica often wondered how Rebecca managed to keep her job, with her constant tardiness and apparent disregard for authority. Their boss, Mr. Thompson, seemed to tolerate Rebecca's inefficiencies without any decisive action. Jessica assumed he had a soft spot for Rebecca—a unprofessional weakness.

But that all changed one fateful morning when Jessica arrived early to the office, as she always did. As she settled at her spotless desk, brewing coffee and booting up her computer, she noticed Mr. Thompson approaching. He looked more serious than Jessica had ever seen him. He quietly asked her to join him in his office.

The words reverberated through her ears like a thousand chaotic echoes, each one heavier than the last. "Jessica, I'm sorry, but we have to let you go." Her eyes widened in shock, and her heart dropped to her stomach. It was words she did not expect nor comprehend. It was her, Jessica, who was being terminated, and not Rebecca as she'd long assumed would be the case.

Her usually steady and composed voice trembled as she asked for an explanation. Was it due to a couple of missed deadlines? A poorly executed project? Mr. Thompson, with a pained look in his eyes, explained that it had nothing to do with her performance. He admired her work ethic, punctuality, and attention to detail. Unfortunately, the company was undergoing budget cuts, and they had to make some difficult decisions, he said. They had to downsize.

As Jessica grappled with the reality of her situation, she couldn't help but feel a sense of injustice. Why was she, the diligent and hardworking employee, the one being let go, while Rebecca, despite her lack of discipline, was allowed to stay? Was there any fairness left in the world?

Overwhelmed with emotions and with tears welling up in her eyes, Jessica packed up her belongings from her pristine desk and left the building for the last time. Out in the world now, she felt a fire ignite within her—a determination more potent than she'd ever known. She would prove them all wrong. This setback was only a stepping-stone towards something bigger and greater. Jessica decided to embrace her future with open arms, ready to face new challenges and victories. And one day, she'd look back on this moment with a bittersweet smile, thinking of how much she'd grown and the person she'd become. The end of one chapter marked the beginning of another, full of endless possibilities.
