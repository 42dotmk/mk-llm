Mushrooms belong to the group of fungi known as Basidiomycetes, which is a large and diverse taxonomic group within the fungal kingdom. Basidiomycetes are characterized by producing specialized reproductive structures called basidia, on which sexual spores called basidiospores are formed. These structures give the group its scientific name, with "basidium" meaning "little pedestal" in Latin, referring to the supporting structure and "mycete" relating to fungi.

Basidiomycetes are an important group of fungi known for their ecological roles, their diverse fruiting bodies, and applications in biotechnology and human food consumption. The group is quite extensive, with over 30,000 known species, and it is estimated that there are thousands more yet to be discovered.

These fungi can be found in various habitats worldwide, from terrestrial ecosystems, such as forests, grasslands, and wetlands, to aquatic environments, and even as symbionts in plant roots. The most recognizable members of this group are the mushrooms, which usually possess a familiar cap-and-stem fruiting body structure, but other forms, such as brackets, corals, and puffballs, are also present.

In terms of their ecological roles, Basidiomycetes serve essential functions. Many species act as decomposers, breaking down decaying organic matter into simpler compounds, thereby cycling nutrients through ecosystems. Other species form mutualistic relationships called mycorrhiza with the roots of plants, assisting in nutrient exchange and improving plant health. Some mushrooms are parasitic upon other fungi, plants, and even animals, causing diseases and rot.

Mushrooms within the Basidiomycetes group can be further divided into several orders, families, and genera. Here is a brief overview of some of the most well-known taxonomic groups:

1. Agaricales: This order includes the familiar gilled mushrooms, such as Agaricus, Amanita, and Lactarius. 

2. Boletales: This order includes mushrooms with a porous underside, like Boletus, Suillus, and Leccinum.

3. Polyporales: This group includes a wide array of fungi, often with a more leathery or corky fruiting body, like Trametes, Fomes, and Ganoderma.

4. Russulales: This order includes brittle mushrooms, such as Russula and Lactarius, and large ectomycorrhizal mushrooms like the prized matsutake, Tricholoma.

5. Cantharellales: This group contains the popular edible mushrooms known as chanterelles, such as Cantharellus and Craterellus, often with unique funnel shapes and ridged hymenium.

6. Gomphales: This order includes unique club or coral mushrooms, like Clavariadelphus, Ramaria, and Clavulina.

Many of these mushrooms have economic importance, as they serve as a food source in many cuisines, such as Agaricus bisporus, the common button mushroom, or Pleurotus ostreatus, the oyster mushroom. Some mushrooms possess medicinal properties, such as Ganoderma lucidum, a fungus traditionally used in East Asian medicine. Other mushrooms, like Amanita phalloides (the death cap), are highly toxic and can be lethal when ingested.

In summary, mushrooms belong to the group of fungi called Basidiomycetes, which is known for their distinctive reproductive structures and their notable ecological roles. They are incredibly diverse, with a multitude of forms, functions, and species, contributing to the fascinating world of fungi.
