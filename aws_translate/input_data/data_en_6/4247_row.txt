We are aware that it is difficult for the Commission and the Council to collect this data because there are member states that are not ready to provide it, probably because they have not conducted a study on the consequences of improving the procedures for deciding the status of refugee or international protection.

In more detail, this statement acknowledges the challenges faced by institutions such as the Commission and the Council when it comes to gathering information from various member states about their procedures for granting refugee or international protection status. The difficulties might arise from the fact that some member states may not have conducted adequate research on the impact of enhancing their decision-making processes in this area, which might explain their reluctance or inability to share their data.

There can be several reasons behind the lack of research on the consequences of improving the procedures for deciding refugee or international protection status. Firstly, member states might not have the necessary resources, expertise, or capacity to conduct comprehensive studies on this subject. It might be difficult for them to allocate funds, personnel, or time to such issues, particularly if they are already dealing with significant economic, social, or political challenges.

Secondly, member states might have different priorities, with some countries placing a greater emphasis on border security, national identity, or public opinion, rather than on the humanitarian aspects of migration and asylum. As a result, their decision-making processes and criteria for granting refugee status or international protection might reflect these priorities, which could lead to less willingness to collaborate or share information on this topic.

Thirdly, certain member states might simply be unwilling to disclose information about their procedures for granting refugee or international protection status due to national security or political reasons. Openly sharing data on these matters might be perceived as a sign of weakness or might reveal sensitive details about the state's approach to migration and asylum policy, which could be used against them by other countries or groups.

Regardless of the reasons behind the lack of shared data, the statement emphasizes the importance of cooperation and collaboration among member states and European institutions like the Commission and the Council to improve the decision-making processes and the overall management of refugees and asylum seekers. By working together and sharing best practices, experiences, and expertise, member states can strengthen their capacity to address these challenges more effectively and create a more fair, transparent, and humane system for deciding on refugee and international protection status.

In conclusion, the statement underlines the challenges faced by the Commission and the Council in collecting data from member states on their procedures for granting refugee or international protection status. The lack of research and shared information might be attributed to various factors, such as limited resources or capacity, different priorities, or national security concerns. However, fostering cooperation and collaboration among member states and European institutions is crucial for developing better mechanisms and approaches to dealing with this important issue.
