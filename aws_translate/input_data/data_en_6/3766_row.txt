Plot:

The film begins with Toby (the protagonist) and his gang of close-knit friends, including Sarah, Max, Lucy, and Ryan, going about their daily high school routine. The group is comprised of diverse personalities; Toby is an introverted geek who dreams of success beyond high school, Sarah is a confident and outgoing athlete, Max is the sarcastic jokester, Lucy is the artsy, free-spirit, and Ryan is the ambitious, straight-A scholar.

As they prepare for the end of the school year, Eric, a popular yet enigmatic student, hands out invitations for an exclusive party at his house that evening. Surprised by the invite and determined to make the most of the night, Toby convinces his friends to accompany him to the party.

Upon arriving at Eric's lavish house, the friends are amazed by the size and modern design of the residence. As they venture inside, they discover an enormous crowd of students and join the party. Toby's gang inevitably separates as they each follow their individual interests and personal challenges.

Toby struggles with his social anxiety and attempts to gather his courage to talk to his crush, Jessica. Sarah, motivated by a dose of competitive spirit, challenges Ericâ€™s friend, Jake, to a game of beer pong. Max uncovers a secret room filled with Eric's impressive collection of vintage video games, and ends up bonding with a group of fellow gaming enthusiasts. Lucy, captivated by a talented guitarist, finds herself exploring her musical side and performing an impromptu duet with him. Ryan quickly finds himself amidst a debate with a group of top students, competing for the title of "smartest in the school."

As the night progresses, each character experiences their own personal growth and self-discovery. Toby gains the confidence to approach Jessica, learning that she had always admired his intelligence and kindness. Sarah and Jake form an unexpected friendship after their friendly competition. Max shares his passion for gaming with others and realizes that people enjoy nerdy interests more than he'd previously assumed. Lucy's musical talents are encouraged, leaving her inspired to embrace her creativity. Ryan loosens up after realizing that there's more to life than just academics and perfect grades. 

As the sun begins to rise, Toby's gang reunites in the backyard, discussing the incredible experiences they've had during the night. Just as they're about to leave, Eric approaches the group and thanks them for attending. Toby questions Eric's motives for inviting them, to which Eric reveals that he had admired their friendship from afar and felt that they deserved a memorable night together before they all went their separate ways after graduation.

The film ends with the friends walking home together, arm-in-arm, carrying the lessons they've learned and the memories they've made at Eric's unforgettable party. The story emphasizes the importance of embracing change, overcoming insecurities, and cherishing the bonds of friendship.
