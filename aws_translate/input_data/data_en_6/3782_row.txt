Q: On a particular day, a car traveled from Ningi to Zipra in 80% of the time it traveled from Ngapara to Zipra. If the car took 60 hours to travel from Ngapara to Zipra, calculate the total time the car traveled that day.
A: If the car traveled from Ningi to Zipra in 80% of the time it traveled from Ngapara to Zipra, it took 80 / 100 * 60 = 48 hours to travel from Ningi to Zipra. The total travel time that day is 48 + 60 = 108 hours. The answer is 108.
Question: Hanna has twice as many erasers as Rachel. Rachel has three less than one-half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers. If Tanya has 20 erasers, and half of them are red, how many erasers does Hanna have?
Answer: Half of Tanya's 20 erasers are red, so she has 20 / 2 = 10 red erasers. One - half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers is 10 / 2 = 5 red erasers. Rachel's three less than one - half as many erasers as Tanya's red erasers, which is 5 - 3 = 2 erasers. Hanna has twice as many erasers as Rachel, for a total of 2 * 2 = 4 erasers. The answer is 4.
[Question]Jackson is laying tile in a courtyard that measures 10 feet by 25 feet. He needs 4 tiles per square foot of space. 40% of the tiles are green marble that costs $3/tile, and the rest are red tile that costs $1.50/tile. How much does he pay total for tile?
[Answer]First find the area of the courtyard: 10 feet * 25 feet = 250 feet. Then multiply the area by the number of tiles per square foot to find the total number of tiles needed: 250 feet * 4 tiles / square foot = 1000 tiles. Then multiply the number of tiles by the percentage that are green to find the total number of green tiles: 1000 tiles * 40% = 400 tiles. Subtract that number from the total number of tiles to find the number of red tiles: 1000 tiles - 400 tiles = 600 tiles. Multiply the number of red tiles by the price per red tile to find the cost of the red tiles: 600 tiles * $1.50 / tile = $900. Multiply the number of green tiles by the price per green tile to find the cost of the green tiles: 400 tiles * $3.00 / tile = $1200. Then add the cost of each type of tile to find the total cost: $900 + $1200 = $2100. The answer is 2100.
Q: The teacher assigned a minimum of 25 pages of reading for homework. Harrison read 10 more pages than assigned. Pam read 15 more pages than Harrison and Sam read twice the amount of Pam. How many pages did Sam read?
A: Harrison read 10 more than the assigned 25 pages so he read 10 + 25 = 35 pages. Pam read 15 more pages than Harrison's 35 pages so she read 15 + 35 = 50 pages. Sam read twice the amount of Pam's 50 pages so he read 2 * 50 = 100 pages. The answer is 100.
Question: Sarah is buying Christmas presents for her family. She starts her shopping with a certain amount of money. She buys 2 toy cars for $11 each for her sons. She buys a scarf for $10 for her mother. Then she buys a beanie for $14 for her brother. If she has $7 remaining after purchasing the beanie, how much money did she start with?
Answer: Before purchasing the beanie, Sarah has $7 + $14 = $21. Before purchasing the scarf, Sarah has $21 + $10 = $31. The total cost of the toy cars is 2 * $11 = $22. Before purchasing the toy cars, Sarah has $31 + $22 = $53. The answer is 53.
