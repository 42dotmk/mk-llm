No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. The first question is about the consequences of rubbing a cat's fur in the wrong direction, while the second question is about cats' behavior in response to humans who haven't showered for several days.

1. Why should you never rub a cat's fur the wrong way?

Rubbing a cat's fur the wrong way can lead to several adverse outcomes for both the cat and the person engaging in the behavior:

a. Discomfort: Rubbing a cat's fur in the opposite direction disrupts the natural alignment of the hair shafts, leading to discomfort for the animal. Cats maintain a specific hair structure for a variety of reasons, including insulation, protection, and facilitating their grooming process. Disrupting this structure can cause irritation and stress for the cat.

b. Stress and Anxiety: Cats are sensitive creatures that rely on their environment, routine, and the people in their lives for a sense of security. An action that causes discomfort or pain, such as rubbing their fur the wrong way, increases their stress and anxiety levels. This can lead to behavior changes, such as aggression, hiding, or overgrooming.

c. Aggression: A cat that feels threatened or uncomfortable might respond aggressively in an attempt to protect itself. This could involve biting, scratching, or hissing at the person causing the disturbance. Thus, rubbing a cat's fur the wrong way could lead to injuries or escalating tensions between the animal and its owner.

d. Damage to the coat: Repeatedly rubbing a cat's fur in the wrong direction can cause damage to its coat. This may result in hair breakage, tangling, or matting, which compromises the cat's overall health and well-being.

2. Do cats rub their faces against people more if they go for several days without showering?

When cats rub their faces against people, they engage in a behavior called "bunting." Bunting serves several purposes:

a. Scent-marking: Cats have scent glands on various parts of their bodies, including their cheeks. When they rub their faces against objects or people, they deposit pheromones, which are chemical signals that communicate information to other cats or identify territories. A person who has not showered for several days has a stronger odor, which might prompt a cat to engage in bunting more frequently to reinforce its scent mark on that individual.

b. Affection: Cats express their affection for people by rubbing their faces against them. They may do this more frequently with someone they have a strong bond with or feel comfortable around. The showering habits of a person may not necessarily influence this behavior, as long as the cat remains familiar with the individual and their scent.

c. Comfort-seeking: Some cats may find the scent of their surroundings or people comforting. If a person hasn't showered for a few days, their scent will be more pronounced, which could make the cat feel more at ease and prompt it to engage in bunting behavior more frequently.

However, it is essential to note that individual cats have distinct personalities, preferences, and reactions. Some cats may not react differently to a person who hasn't showered, while others may increase their bunting behavior. Observing your cat's specific habits and reactions is crucial to understanding its needs and maintaining a healthy relationship.
