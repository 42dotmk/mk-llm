Losing weight involves a combination of exercises and a balanced diet, and there isn't a sudden, safe, and sustainable method to lose weight quickly. However, several tactics can help you drop a few pounds as swiftly and safely as possible.

1. **Diet Planning**: 
   - **Eat Balanced Meals**: Do not cut off any nutrient completely. Your meals should include protein (from lean meats or plant sources like beans and pulses), complex carbohydrates (from whole grains and legumes), and healthy fats (from sources like avocados, fish, and nuts). Include a colorful array of vegetables and fruits for their vitamins, minerals, and antioxidant content.
   - **Reduce Calorie Intake**: Weight loss depends significantly on reduced calorie intake. But this doesn't mean you should starve yourself. Make smart food choices. Choose foods that are high in nutrients and low in empty calories. Processes food and sugary drinks should be avoided.
   - **Portion Control**: Rather than having 2-3 large meals, aim for smaller and frequent meals throughout the day. This aids digestion, promotes absorption and thus reduces fat accumulation. 

2. **Exercise**: Consistent physical activity is crucial for burning calories and achieving your weight loss goal. Here are types of exercise that are beneficial:
    - **Aerobic Exercises**: This can include activities like brisk walking, running, or cycling. Aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate cardio activity or 75 minutes of vigorous cardio activity per week.
    - **Strength Training**: Don't overlook strength training. Lifting weights helps to build muscle, and the more muscle you have, the more calories you burn, even at rest. Try to incorporate at least two sessions of strength training into your weekly fitness routine.
    - **High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)**: HIIT involves quick and very intense bursts of activity. This can help you burn more fat and boosts your metabolic rate, even after your workout is over.

3. **Monitor Your Progress**: Keep track of your weight loss journey by keeping a journal. Write down what you eat, how much you exercise, and any insights you notice as you make changes to your lifestyle. Weigh yourself consistently (weekly, at the same time of day) and don't be discouraged by small fluctuations. Instead, keep an eye on the overall trend.

4. **Healthy Lifestyle**: Good sleep, reducing stress, staying hydrated, and quitting bad habits like smoking or drinking can speed up the weight loss process as they might have indirect effects on your weight control.

5. **Avoid Quick Fixes**: Beware of weight loss products or plans that promise rapid weight loss without the need for healthy eating or exercise. They usually work only in the short term and can come with health risks.

6. **Consult a professional**: A dietician or a nutritionist can provide you with a personalized diet plan and guide you through your weight loss journey. A fitness trainer can help you with your exercise routine.

Always remember, gradual and consistent weight loss is more effective and healthier than crash diets or sudden extensive exercise regimes. Start with these guidelines and adjust your plan as per your body's response. Don't forget to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any weight loss plan to ensure that the changes you're making are healthy and suitable for you.
