Q: There were 15 males and 10 more girls at the party. Each attendee received 2 cans of soft drinks. If Mary bought several boxes of soft drinks where a box contains 8 cans and is priced at $5 for each box, how much did Mary spend on soft drinks?
A: There were 10 + 15 = 25 girls in the party. So, there were a total of 15 + 25 = 40 attendees. 40 x 2 = 80 cans of soft drinks are needed. So, Mary bought 80 / 8 = 10 boxes of soft drinks. Therefore, Mary spent 10 x $5 = $50 on soft drinks. The answer is 50.
Question: A mountain range has 200 active volcanoes. In a particular year, 20% of the volcanoes exploded in the first two months, 40% of the remaining exploded by the half of the year, and at the end of the year, another 50% of the volcanoes that hadn't already erupted also exploded. How many mountains are still intact at the end of the year?
Answer: By the first two months, 20 / 100 * 200 = 40 mountains had erupted. The total number of mountains remaining after the first round of explosions is 200 - 40 = 160. When 40% of the remaining mountains exploded, the number of mountains that were still intact decreased by 40 / 100 * 160 = 64. The number of mountains that hadn't exploded after the second explosions is 160 - 64 = 96. When 50% of the mountains which were still intact exploded, the number of mountains that hadn't erupted was reduced by 50 / 100 * 96 = 48. At the end of the year, 96 - 48 = 48 mountains remained intact and hadn't exploded. The answer is 48.
[Question]It’s exam season and Tristan has several exams to prepare for. On Monday, he studies for 4 hours then studies for twice this long on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday he studies for 3 hours each day. He wants to study for a total of 25 hours over the week and divides the remaining amount of study time evenly between Saturday and Sunday. How many hours does Tristan spend studying on Saturday?
[Answer]On Tuesday, Tristan studies twice as long as he did on Monday and this amounts to 4 hours * 2 = 8 hours. So in the first 5 days of the week, he studies for a total of 4 hours Monday + 8 hours Tuesday + 3 hours Wednesday + 3 hours Thursday + 3 hours Friday = 21 hours. He therefore has 25 planned hours – 21 used hours = 4 hours left to study. As he splits his time evenly over 2 days, he spends 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours studying on Saturday. The answer is 2.

Question: Robbie is tracking his nutrition intake per week. He eats 3 cups of rice in the morning, 2 cups of rice in the afternoon, and 5 cups of rice in the evening. If a cup of rice has 10 grams of fat, how many grams of fat does Robbie get in a week?
Answer: Robbie gets 3 x 10 = 30 grams of fat every morning. He gets 10 x 2 = 20 grams of fat every afternoon. And he gets 5 x 10 = 50 grams of fat every evening. So, the total grams of fat he gets every day is 50 + 30 + 20 = 100. Therefore, the total grams of fat he gets every week is 100 x 7 = 700. The answer is 700.
