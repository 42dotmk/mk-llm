Dennis was better at expressing their feelings than Benjamin because he had spent considerable time intentionally developing his emotional intelligence and practicing various forms of communication. This difference between the two individuals can be attributed to multiple factors, which include not only their respective personality traits but also their upbringing, experiences, and the ways in which they have chosen to cultivate these skills.

From a young age, Dennis showed a natural proclivity for understanding and empathizing with others' emotions. His parents encouraged this behavior by consistently validating his emotions, teaching him how to label them, and helping him develop the tools necessary to express them constructively. This positive reinforcement instilled in Dennis a strong sense of self-awareness and emotional literacy, which allowed him to navigate social situations effectively and build strong connections with the people around him.

As Dennis continued to grow and develop, he consistently sought out opportunities to hone these skills further. He participated in group therapy, emotional intelligence workshops, and other forms of interpersonal development programs that focused on fostering empathy, active listening, and emotional self-awareness. This education provided Dennis with even more strategies and tools to express his feelings in a healthy manner.

In addition to this formal education, Dennis made a conscious effort to practice expressing his feelings in his day-to-day life. He set goals for himself, such as maintaining a regular journal-writing practice to explore his emotions and clearly articulating his thoughts and emotions to his friends and family. By practicing these habits, Dennis refined his ability to gauge his own emotions with clarity and precision, as well as the emotions of others.

In contrast, Benjamin never quite received the same level of emotional support growing up. His family environment discouraged open expression of emotions, leading him to suppress his feelings and struggle with understanding the emotions of others. Without the early foundation of emotional literacy that Dennis had, Benjamin found it difficult to navigate social situations and forge strong connections with others.

Furthermore, Benjamin did not actively seek out opportunities to develop his emotional intelligence and communication skills. While he may have been aware of the potential benefits of doing so, the lack of initial support created a barrier that made it difficult for him to prioritize emotional growth in the same way Dennis did. As a result, Benjamin's ability to understand and express his feelings remained underdeveloped compared to Dennis.

Due to these experiences and personal choices, Dennis became better at expressing his feelings than Benjamin over time. Dennis' commitment to emotional growth and willingness to engage in self-reflection have allowed him to become a more empathetic, understanding, and effective communicator when it comes to articulating his feelings. Meanwhile, Benjaminâ€™s lack of emotional support, minimal practice, and differing priorities have left him struggling to connect with others and express his emotions openly. This divergence in emotional intelligence and communication skills is ultimately what sets Dennis apart from Benjamin in terms of expressing their feelings.
