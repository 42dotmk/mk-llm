Title: Deciphering the Mysteries of Stonehenge: A Look into the Geologic Findings

Introduction:
Stonehenge - one of the most enduring and enigmatic prehistoric monuments in the world, has captivated and puzzled historians, archaeologists, and tourists alike for centuries. New research by a geologist suggests that there may be "no evidence" that some of the stones at Stonehenge, originating from two Pembrokeshire quarries, were excavated by humans. This latest finding adds another layer of complexity to our understanding of this ancient site and raises further questions about the methods and motivations behind the construction of Stonehenge.

Step 1: Exploring the Origin of the Stones in Question:
To better comprehend the implications of this claim, it is important to first explore the stones in question. Stonehenge is primarily constructed from two types of stones: large sarsen stones, and smaller bluestones. The investigation has focused on the bluestones, which have been traced back to two quarries in the Preseli Hills of Pembrokeshire, Wales - Carn Menyn and Craig Rhos-y-Felin.

Step 2: Presenting the Geologist's Findings:
The geologist behind this claim has studied samples of the stones at Stonehenge and the quarries in Pembrokeshire and posited that one theory suggests that glaciers might have transported the stones during the last Ice Age, rather than human transport. The absence of evidence for human excavation techniques, such as quarrying or mining, lends credibility to this natural geological theory.

Step 3: Discussing the Implications of the Findings:
If indeed the stones were not excavated by humans, it challenges the widely accepted theory that Stonehenge was an intentional, labor-intensive engineering feat carried out to serve a specific purpose. The presence of these stones at the site could have more to do with natural geological movements than with human intervention, which complicates our interpretation of Stonehenge's construction and its meaning.

Step 4: Exploring Alternative Theories for Stonehenge's Construction:
Given these findings, it becomes necessary to explore alternative theories in order to reestablish an understanding of Stonehenge's construction in human history. Whether the stones were brought to the site by glaciers or arrived through unknown human intervention, the positioning and structure of the monument still indicate that it had practical and symbolic significance for the prehistoric people who built it.

Step 5: Continuing the Investigation of Stonehenge's Mysteries:
Despite the latest findings proving inconclusive about the role humans played in procuring the necessary stones for Stonehenge, it is essential to continue delving deep into the mysteries of this iconic monument. New technologies and future discoveries may shed more light on the true story of Stonehenge's construction, allowing us to uncover the motivations and technical prowess of our ancestors.

Conclusion:
Whether the stones at the center of this captivating monument were excavated and transported by humans or arrived on the site through glacial movements, the mystery of Stonehenge endures. Through extensive research, exploration, and passionate curiosity, we inch ever closer to unlocking the secrets behind this ancient marvel and, in doing so, gain insight not just on our history but also on our capabilities as a species.
