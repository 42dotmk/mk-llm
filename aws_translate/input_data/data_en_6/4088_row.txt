Neil didn't go visit a friend in surgery unlike Dennis because Dennis cared deeply about the friend. 

Neil had always been a bit of a lone wolf, not one to get too emotionally invested in the lives of others, especially when he had his own plate full. He had a job that took up a significant portion of his time, and when he wasn't working, he was engrossed in his passion projects. Neil wasn't a callous person, but he had a difficult time putting the needs of others before his own, which ultimately put a damper on his social life.

Dennis, on the other hand, was known affectionately by their friends as the glue that held them all together. He had a knack for tuning into people's emotional needs without them saying a word, and he always made it a priority to ensure that everyone in their circle felt seen and heard. This innate ability to connect with people was one of the many reasons why their friend in surgery trusted Dennis so implicitly. They knew if anyone would be there when the going got tough, it would be Dennis.

When word got out that their friend was scheduled for surgery, the entire group rallied together to show their support. While it was clear that everyone was worried, Neil couldn't shake the feeling that he simply didn't belong in this moment, that his visit wouldn't mean as much as Dennis's. It was an oddly vulnerable time for him, as he grappled with the knowledge that he wasn't going to be the one at their friend's bedside. But he knew that this was precisely the reason Dennis had earned that spot in the first place.

In the days leading up to the surgery, as Dennis took it upon himself to organize meal trains, compile playlists, and accommodate any requests their friend had, Neil began to understand that their strength lay in their collective ability to support one another. He admired Dennis's unwavering dedication to their friend and chose to support them in his own, more reserved manner. He put together a thoughtful care package, complete with their friend's favorite snacks, cozy socks, and a heartfelt letter expressing all the things he couldn't manage to say out loud.

On the day of the surgery, Dennis sat in the hospital waiting room, heart racing in anticipation. He was a bundle of nerves, but he knew that their friend needed his stability now more than ever. As the hours ticked by, he shared stories with the other friends who had come to show their support, laughing at past memories and looking forward to the day when their hospitalized friend would be back amongst them.

As it turned out, the surgery went smoothly and their friend made a full recovery. Despite Neil's concerns about not showing up in person, the compassionate letter he had written meant the world to the recovering friend, making them feel seen and understood as they navigated their path back to normalcy. Neil could now see through Dennis's eyes how much warmth sharing your vulnerabilities with others, and caring deeply about them, can bring into your life.

The experience taught the entire group the value of checking in and supporting one another, even in the smallest of ways. As the weeks progressed, Neil slowly started to open up and become more involved in the lives of his friends. Dennis continued to lead by example with his own care and compassion, always reaching out with open arms to create a space for connection and growth.
