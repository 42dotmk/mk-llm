The plan devised by Raivis Zeltits, a Latvian politician and an influential theorist, to form a federation of Central and Eastern European countries after World War I was known as the "Intermarium" plan. The main objective behind this concept was to create a buffer zone and a strong alliance to contain the rising powers of Bolshevik Russia in the East and Germany in the West to maintain peace and balance in the region after the devastating war.

The Intermarium plan was originally founded on the geopolitical vision of Józef Piłsudski, a prominent Polish statesman who sought to revive the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as a federation of Central and Eastern European countries. Zeltits, heavily influenced by Piłsudski's idea of the Intermarium, aimed to incorporate the Baltic States, Poland, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia, and possibly Hungary, Finland, and Bulgaria into a single federation.

The key principles behind the Intermarium plan were:

1. Unity and cooperation amongst the nations of Central and Eastern Europe to form a collective defense and a diplomatic front against potential threats from Bolshevism and potential German expansionism.

2. Formation of a geopolitical counterweight by neutralizing Germany and Russia's influence over the region and ensuring the sovereignty and independence of these countries.

3. Establishment of a democratic, federal system of governance which incorporated cultural, economic, military, and political cooperation amongst the federated states to ensure their stability and mutual development.

4. Promotion of intercultural understanding and harmonious relationships within the Intermarium region based on shared ideals of liberty, democracy, and self-determination.

5. Forming a strong economic bloc that would stimulate regional trade, economic growth, and technological advancements amongst the Intermarium nations, thereby reducing their dependency on external economies.

However, the Intermarium plan faced several critical challenges:

1. Complex historical, political, and ethnic differences created divisions among the Central and Eastern European nations, making it difficult for them to come to a mutual consensus and cooperate.

2. Ambitious nationalistic aspirations and territorial disputes amongst the potential member states often hindered progress with respect to the concept of the Intermarium.

3. Resistance from both Germany and Russia, which recognized the Intermarium as a potential threat to their respective regional dominance and control.

4. The lack of overall consensus and support from major global powers like the United States, United Kingdom, and France.

Despite Zeltits' and other proponents' efforts, the Intermarium plan ultimately failed to materialize due to a combination of internal conflicts amongst the prospective member states and external pressures from more powerful neighboring countries, specifically Germany and the Soviet Union. The nations within this region either pursued alliances with other powers or were coerced into the Soviet sphere of influence, leading to the formation of the Eastern Bloc after World War II. It wasn't until the end of the Cold War and subsequent accession of many Central and Eastern European countries to NATO and the European Union that regional cooperation and integration could be fully realized.
