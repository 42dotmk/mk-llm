In the Indian subcontinent during the 5th century AD, the Pallava Dynasty ruled with prosperity and peace, maintaining strong trade connections and flourishing arts and culture.

The story begins as a young Prince Bodhidharma (the protagonist) lives a life of luxury and privilege, receiving the finest education and mastering martial arts. However, he continually experiences recurring dreams and visions of an unfamiliar land and struggles to understand the meaning behind them.

One day, the kingdom receives a message from a mysterious envoy from the east, who has come in search of someone they believe is the fulfillment of a long-prophesized spiritual leader. These envoys recognize that this chosen one is none other than Prince Bodhidharma. Intrigued and compelled to understand the meaning behind his vivid dreams, Bodhidharma follows the envoys back to their homeland, China.

As Bodhidharma departs, a conspiracy unfolds within the kingdom, revealing a faction of court officials plotting to take over the Pallava Dynasty by exploiting the prince's absence. While on his journey to China, Bodhidharma undergoes rigorous physical and spiritual training, discovering his true purpose and destiny – teaching the Chinese people the secrets of meditation, medicine, and martial arts.
