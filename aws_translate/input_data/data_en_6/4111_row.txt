Title: "The Frequency of Freedom"

Genre: War/Action/Adventure/Drama

Logline: Second Lieutenant Steven Hauk, a rookie military intelligence officer, sets out on a dangerous and emotionally charged mission to expose corruption and save his team from being manipulated into a deadly conspiracy.

Plot:

Act 1:

Second Lieutenant Steven Hauk (mid-20s) arrives at Camp Delta (a fictional military base) in Afghanistan, full of ambition and pride in serving his country. He quickly learns that he's been assigned to a top-secret military unit, called The Phoenix Program, whose primary objective is to identify, capture, and terminate high-value targets in the war against terrorism. Hauk is responsible for decoding enemy communications so his team is alerted to potential threats.

While bonding with his new teammates, Hauk discovers that there's more to this covert operation than he initially thought. Morale within the squad is low due to the suspicious death of their previous leader, who uncovered evidence of internal corruption before his demise.

Act 2:

Driven by his innate sense of justice, Hauk starts digging into the circumstances surrounding the previous leader's death. He stumbles upon several encrypted messages pointing to a high-ranking military official, General Oswald Kane, as the man behind the illicit arms deals with the very terrorists they were tasked to fight.

Hauk tries to share his findings with his squad, but they are hesitant to believe him. They've all heard stories of Hauk's predecessor's alleged paranoia and warn him not to follow in his footsteps or risk the same demise.

But Hauk refuses to stay silent and anonymously leaks the intel to a journalist, Jessica Hamilton, who's covering stories on military corruption. The leak catches the attention of both the local military police and General Kane, who now sees Hauk as a threat to his empire.

Act 3:

As the investigation into the leaks escalates, General Kane starts manipulating Hauk's team to turn against each other, under the pretext of looking for a traitor. Disheartened by his team's distrust, Hauk is captured by Kane's goons and held in a hidden bunker.

While held captive, Hauk discovers that Kane's motives run deeper- Kane is part of an international terrorist network and is plotting an attack on US soil. Hauk escapes the bunker just as General Kane is about to leave for the States.

Hauk enlists the help of Jessica Hamilton to expose Kane and his terrorist connections. With her help, Hauk is able to convince his team that they were targets of a deadly conspiracy. Together, they close in on Kane and foil the attack, right before it's executed.

In the climactic scene, Hauk confronts a desperate General Kane, who attempts to negotiate his way out of the situation. Second Lieutenant Steven Hauk, with his newfound confidence and wisdom, chooses to take Kane into custody, staying true to his morals and choosing justice over revenge.

In the end, Hauk is promoted and finally garners the respect of his teammates. He decides to stay with The Phoenix Program, vowing to continue to protect and serve from within its ranks.

The movie ends with Second Lieutenant Steven Hauk, now a symbol of heroism and integrity, transmitting a message of hope and unity to his fellow soldiers through a radio broadcast, symbolizing the "frequency of freedom" he has come to represent.
