Susan, her voice trembling slightly as the weight of the situation began to settle in. "We can't just stand around feeling helpless while Aslan's nowhere to be found."

"I agree," Peter spoke up, his voice firm and determined. "Our first priority should be to search for Aslan and make sure he's safe. He might need our help, or perhaps he has important information for us."

The siblings nodded, and together they devised a plan to split into two small search parties. Peter and Susan would head east toward the Great River, while Edmund and Lucy ventured west into the dense forests surrounding the plains. They promised to regroup by nightfall at their original meeting spot.

Before they set off, Peter pulled out a small, worn map of Narnia that he had safely tucked in his pocket. "We'll cover more ground this way," he explained, tracing his finger along the terrain, marking their route. "We must stay diligent and keep a sharp eye out for any clues or signs that Aslan might have left behind."

As each group headed in their respective directions, with apprehensive hearts and the weight of uncertainty heavy on their shoulders, their quest to find their beloved Aslan began.

Peter and Susan braved the rugged terrain along the eastern bank of the Great River, combing through the tall grasses and calling out Aslan's name. Their voices would frequently ring loud and clear across the valleys and hills, but the only response was a sorrowful silence that haunted the air. As the hours wore on, their search continued to prove fruitless, yet their determination remained as strong as ever.

On the western front, Edmund and Lucy trekked through the shadowed forests with the eerie, lingering fog obscuring their path. The gnarled branches above formed a thick canopy, casting a cool darkness over their search. It was disheartening when the whispers of their cries for Aslan were absorbed by the encroaching cedars and pines. Time was ticking away, but they refused to give up on the hope that they would eventually find him.

Night arrived, and the echoing call of nightingales accompanied the weary, hoarse voices of the siblings as they prepared to regroup. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy all stood by their word and returned to the agreed meeting spot at the day's end, their faces etched with exhaustion and despair.

"We had no luck," Peter admitted, his voice heavy with defeat. "Did you find any traces of him in the forest?"

Edmund shook his head solemnly. "Not a single sign. What do we do now?"

Lucy's resolve remained steadfast, her eyes glimmering in the fading light. "We continue searching. Aslan wouldn't abandon us, and we won't abandon him."

In that moment, the siblings embraced one another, their spirits mutually strengthened by a fierce determination to find their lost friend. As they huddled together, they resolved to continue their search into the following day, knowing that their unwavering loyalty and courage would see them through this dark chapter in the history of Narnia.

Their voices may have been hoarse, and the sound of Caspian's horn seemed to dissipate into the night, but their determination did not falter. Their love for Aslan and their duty to protect Narnia drove them onwards, and with the rise of the sun the following day, the siblings began their search anew, driven by the hope that they would soon be reunited with their beloved Aslan.
