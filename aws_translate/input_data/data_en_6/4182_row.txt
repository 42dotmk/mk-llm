Q: Marites internet speed is 10 megabits per second and her monthly internet bill is $20. Marites is planning to upgrade her service and choosing between 20 Mbps and 30 Mbps. If the price of the 30 Mbps is twice the amount of her current monthly bill and the price of the 20 Mbps is $10 more than her current monthly bill, how much will she save per year if she chooses the 20 Mbps than 30 Mbps?
A: The total monthly bill for 30 Mbps is $20 x 2 = $40. She will have to pay $40 x 12 = $480 every year for 30mbps. The total monthly bill for 20 Mbps is $20 + $10 = $30. So, she will have to pay $30 x 12 = $360 for 20 Mbps per year. Therefore the amount she will save per year if she chooses the 20mbps is $480 - $360 = $120. The answer is 120.
Question: Nancy replaced all of the old vinyl tiles in her bathroom with new hardwood flooring. She replaced flooring in two areas of the bathroom: a 10 foot by 10 foot central area, and a 6 foot by 4 foot hallway. How many square feet of hardwood flooring did Nancy install in her bathroom?
Answer: 10 feet by 10 feet central area is 10 * 10 = 100 square feet of space. 6 feet by 4 feet hallway is 4 * 6 - 24 square feet of space. Combined, the two areas where she replaced flooring contain 100 + 24 = 124 square feet of space. The answer is 124.
[Question]Tony drives a car that gets 25 miles to the gallon. He drives 50 miles round trip to work 5 days a week. His tank holds 10 gallons. He begins the week with a full tank and when he runs out he fills up at the local gas station for $2 a gallon. How much money does Tony spend on gas in 4 weeks?
[Answer]First, we need to determine how many miles Tony drives in 4 weeks. We do this by performing 50 * 5 = 250 miles per week. Next, we multiply the weekly total by 4 by performing 4 * 250 = 1000 miles in 4 weeks. Now, we need to find out how many times Tony needs to fill up his gas tank. His gas tank holds enough gas to last 25 * 10 = 250 miles. This means in 4 weeks, he needs to fill up his tank 1000 / 250 = 4 times. Since Tony's gas tank holds 10 gallons, this means he needs to pay for 4 * 10 - 40 gallons of gas in a month. Since gas costs $2 a gallon, this means Tony spends 40 * 2 = $80 on gas every month,. The answer is 80.
Q: Felicia is baking a cake. She needs 2 cups of flour, a cup of white sugar, a 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and a 1/2 cup of oil. Her only measuring scoop is 1/4 cup. How many times does she fill it to complete the measurements?
A: She fills it 8 times for the flour because 2 / (1 / 4) = 8. She fills it 4 times for the white sugar because 1 / (1 / 4) = 4. She fills is 2 times for the oil because (1 / 2) / (1 / 4) = 2. She fills it 1 time for the brown sugar because she needs exactly 1 / 4 of a cup. She fills is 15 times because 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 equals 15. The answer is 15.
