Reasoning and answer: We know that Josh must be 30 years older than his age when they got married, therefore he is 30 + 22 = 52 years old today. If their current combined age is 5 times the age Josh was when they married (22), then their total combined age is 5 * 22 = 110 years. That means that Anna must be 110 - 52 = 58 years old today. If they married 30 years ago, Anna must have been 58 - 30 = 28 years old when they married.
The answer: 28

Question: Josh and Anna were both born on August 17th, but in different years. To consolidate celebrations they also got married on August 17 when Josh turned 22. If today they're celebrating 30 years of marriage and their combined age is exactly 5 times what Josh's age was when they married, how old was Anna when they got married?

Loraine made 12 / 2 = 6 small animals. She made 6 / 3 = 2 large animals. She used 2 * 4 = 8 sticks of wax on large animals. Therefore, Loraine used 12 + 8 = 20 sticks of wax for all the animals.
The answer: 20
Reverse engineering the question: Loraine makes wax sculptures of animals. Large animals take four sticks of wax and small animals take two sticks. She made three times as many small animals as large animals, and she used 12 sticks of wax for small animals. How many sticks of wax did Loraine use to make all the animals?

Reasoning and answer: First, we find out how much in sales the stand makes each hour by multiplying the number of hot dogs sold by the sales price, finding that 2 * 10 = 20 dollars in sales each hour. Then we divide the sales goal for the day by the sales per hour, finding that the stand needs to be open for 200 / 20 = 10 hours to hit its sales goal.
The answer: 10

Question: A hot dog stand sells 10 hot dogs every hour, each one selling for $2. How many hours does the stand need to run to make $200 in sales?

The price of one performance is 3 * $5 = $15. Mark intends to go to the theater once a week, so in 9 weeks he will spend 6 * $15 = $90.
The answer: 90
Reverse engineering the question: Mark loves to see shows in theaters. He decided to visit the theater at least once a week. One performance lasts 3 hours. The price of the ticket depends on the time spent in the theater and stands at $5 for each hour. How much will Mark spend on visits to the theater in 6 weeks?

Reasoning and answer: It's a 100 - foot fence, and Ben whitewashed 10 feet, so there are 100 - 10 = 90 feet left after Ben is done. Billy whitewashed a fifth of that, or 90 / 5 = 18 feet. There is now 90 - 18 = 72 feet of fence left. Johnny whitewashes a third of that, or 72 / 3 = 24 feet. That leaves 72 - 24 = 48 feet of fence left to be whitewashed.
The answer: 48

Question: Tom Sawyer has tricked his friends into whitewashing Aunt Polly's 100-foot fence. His first friend, Ben, whitewashed 10 feet. His second friend Billy whitewashed a fifth of the remaining fence. A third friend, Johnny, whitewashed a third of the fence that was left after that. How much of the fence still needs to be whitewashed?

Reasoning and answer: Helen won twice as many games as Betsy's 5 so Helen won 2 * 5 = 10 games. Susan won three times as many games as Betsy's 5 so Susan won 3 * 5 = 15 games. When you combine their wins, together they won 5 + 10 + 15 = 30 games total.
The answer: 30
