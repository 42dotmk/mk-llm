When planning a trip to the Galapagos Islands, you need to know the best entry points to access this unique and incredible destination. The Galapagos Islands are an archipelago, located about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) off the coast of Ecuador, and part of its territory. There are no direct flights to the Galapagos Islands from locations outside of Ecuador, so you must first fly into the mainland and then take a domestic flight to the islands. Here is a detailed overview of where you should fly in for the Galapagos Islands:

1. Fly into Ecuador:
To visit the Galapagos Islands, you must first fly to Ecuador. The best point of entry is through one of the two international airports in the country: Mariscal Sucre International Airport (UIO) in Quito, the capital city; or José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport (GYE) in Guayaquil, the largest city in Ecuador.

Both airports have numerous connecting flights from major cities across North and South America as well as Europe. Many visitors choose to spend a day or two exploring Quito or Guayaquil before flying out to the Galapagos Islands.

2. Fly to Galapagos Islands:
After arriving in mainland Ecuador, you must take a domestic flight to the Galapagos Islands. There are two airports in the archipelago where you can fly into: Seymour Airport (GPS) on Baltra Island and San Cristóbal Airport (SCY) on San Cristóbal Island. 

- Seymour Airport (GPS) on Baltra Island: Baltra Island is smaller and uninhabited, but it serves as the main gateway to the Galapagos Islands. Seymour Airport is the busiest of the two airports and is commonly used by travelers who plan to visit Santa Cruz Island, which is one of the most popular islands due to its proximity to Baltra. From Seymour Airport, you will need to take a bus to the Itabaca Channel, cross the channel by ferry, and then take a bus or taxi to Puerto Ayora, the main settlement on Santa Cruz Island. Santa Cruz accommodates a wide range of hotels and restaurants for tourists, as well as ample opportunities for wildlife encounters and various boat trips.

- San Cristóbal Airport (SCY) on San Cristóbal Island: San Cristóbal Airport may be a better choice if you're looking for a more laid-back experience or if your tour's starting point is on San Cristóbal Island. It is also the airport of choice for cruises that depart from or return to this island. Once you arrive, it’s only a short 5-10 minute drive to Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, where you can find accommodations, restaurants, and activities.

3. Choosing a domestic flight to the Galapagos Islands:
There are several airlines that operate daily flights between Quito/Guayaquil and the Galapagos Islands. They usually fly early in the morning. Flights from Guayaquil take approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes, while flights from Quito have a stopover in Guayaquil and take about 3 hours in total. Domestic airlines that operate flights to the Galapagos Islands include Avianca, LATAM, and TAME. It's essential to book your flights well in advance, as they can fill up quickly, especially during high tourism seasons.

In conclusion, to access the Galapagos Islands, you should first fly into either Quito or Guayaquil in Ecuador. From there, take a domestic flight to either Seymour Airport on Baltra Island or San Cristóbal Airport on San Cristóbal Island, depending on your preferred destination and tour itinerary.
