The best answer is suburbs.

When looking at the history of Detroit, it is important to understand the factors that led to the situation it finds itself in today, with a large number of abandoned buildings and a significantly decreased population. The main reasons behind this phenomenon can be traced back to the decline of the automotive industry, racial tensions, and white flight, which, in combination, resulted in a mass exodus of people from the city and into the suburbs.

1. Decline of the Automotive Industry:
Detroit was once known as the "Motor City" and was the hub of the American automotive industry. However, starting in the latter half of the 20th century, the industry began to face serious competition from foreign manufacturers, leading to a decline in its market share. This, coupled with increased automation and outsourcing, led to a significant decrease in the number of jobs available within the city. As people lost their jobs or sought better opportunities elsewhere, they began to move away from Detroit, leaving behind large numbers of vacant and abandoned buildings.

2. Racial Tensions:
Detroit, like many other American cities, has had its fair share of racial tensions throughout history. During the 20th century, the city experienced significant demographic shifts as a result of the Great Migration, with a large number of African Americans moving to the city in search of better economic opportunities. However, as the racial makeup of the city changed, tensions between different racial groups began to grow. This was further exacerbated by the policies of the city and federal government, including redlining practices that reinforced racial segregation. Many white residents began to feel uncomfortable or unsafe in the city and chose to move away, contributing to the phenomenon known as "white flight."

3. White Flight and Suburbanization:
White flight refers to the large-scale migration of white people from racially mixed urban regions to more racially homogeneous suburban or exurban areas. Several factors contributed to this movement, including the desire for improved housing and better schools, but one of the principal concerns for many white residents was the growing racial tensions in the city. As a result, they began to move away from the city in search of safer, more comfortable communities. In response to this demand, suburban areas around Detroit began to develop rapidly, offering better housing and amenities for those who could afford to move there.

The combination of these factors led to a vicious cycle in Detroit. As more and more people moved away from the city, the population and tax base began to decline, reducing the city's ability to maintain its infrastructure and provide essential services. This, in turn, contributed to the decline of the city's quality of life, prompting even more people to leave. As a result, Detroit ended up with a large number of abandoned buildings, while its suburban neighbors continued to grow and thrive.

In conclusion, while there may be multiple factors that contributed to the severe decline of Detroit, the best answer to the question of where large amounts of people moved is the suburbs. This movement was driven by a combination of the decline of the automotive industry, racial tensions within the city, and the phenomenon of white flight.
