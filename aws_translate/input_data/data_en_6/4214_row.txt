Question: Gunner has a box of mittens with 20 fewer pairs than a box of plugs. He decides to put 30 more pairs of plugs into the box of plugs. If the box of mittens has 150 pairs of mittens, how many plugs are there?
Answer: Since there are 20 fewer mittens pairs than the plugs, there are 150 + 20 = 170 pairs of plugs. When Gunner decides to add 30 more plugs pairs into the box of plugs, the number of plug pairs increases to 170 + 30 = 200. Since a pair has two, the 200 pairs of plugs total 200 * 2 = 400 plugs. The answer is 400.
[Question]For the gala luncheon planning committee, Margaret wants to serve chicken salad sandwiches using mini croissants. She wants there to be enough food that each person on the committee can have 2 sandwiches each. Her bakery offers 12 minis croissants for $8.00. There are 24 people on the committee. How much will she spend on croissants?
[Answer]There are 24 people on the committee and she wants 2 sandwiches per person so that's 24 * 2 = 48 sandwiches. She can buy the croissants by the dozen and she needs 48 croissants so she needs 48 / 12 = 4 dozen croissants. A dozen croissants cost $8.00 and she needs 4 dozens so that will costs 8 * 4 = $32.00. The answer is 32.
Q: Jane is sewing sequins onto her trapeze artist costume. She sews 6 rows of 8 blue sequins each, 5 rows of 12 purple sequins each, and 9 rows of 6 green sequins each. How many sequins does she add total?
A: First find the total number of blue sequins: 6 rows * 8 sequins / row = 48 sequins. Then find the total number of purple sequins: 5 rows * 12 sequins / row = 60 sequins. Then find the total number of green sequins: 9 rows * 6 sequins / row = 54 sequins. Then add the number of each color of sequin to find the total number of sequins: 48 sequins + 60 sequins + 54 sequins = 162 sequins. The answer is 162.
Question: Shelly and Sam love to go deep sea fishing for swordfish. Each time they go deep sea fishing, Shelly catches 2 less than five swordfish, and Sam catches one less swordfish than Shelly. If Sam and Shelly go fishing 5 times, how many swordfish do they catch in total?
Answer: Shelly catches 2 less than five swordfish each time they go fishing, for a total of 5 - 2 = 3 fish per trip. Sam catches one less swordfish than does Shelly on each trip, or a total of 3 - 1 = 2 swordfish per trip. Together, they catch a total of 3 + 2 = 5 swordfish on each trip. If Sam and Shelly go fishing 5 times, they catch a total of 5 * 5 = 25 swordfish. The answer is 25.
[Question]Grant spends $200.00 a year to have the newspaper delivered daily to his house. Juanita buys the newspaper daily. Monday through Saturday, she spends $0.50 and on Sunday she spends $2.00. How much more money does Juanita spend buying the newspaper yearly than Grant?
[Answer]Monday through Saturday Juanita buys the paper for $0.50 so that's 6 * $0.50 = $3.00. She spends $2.00 for Sunday and $3.00 for the other 6 days so she spends $2 + $3 = $5.00 for the newspaper weekly. Over 52 weeks she spends 52 * $5 = $260.00. Juanita spends $260.00 on the newspaper for the year and Grants spends $200.00 a year so Juanita spends $260 - $200 = $60.00 more. The answer is 60.
