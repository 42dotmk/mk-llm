Question 1: Why is economics considered a social science?

Economics is considered a social science because it examines the behavior of individuals, groups, and organizations in the management and allocation of resources. The primary focus of economics is to understand and predict human behavior in relation to scarce resources, which include not only money but also time, talent, and natural resources. 

As a social science, economics employs scientific methods and systematic inquiry to study the various ways in which people make choices and interact with one another within the context of their economic activities. Some of the key areas that economics focuses on are the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, and the resulting impact on overall wealth and welfare. It also examines how government policies and institutions can affect economic performance.

Economists use both quantitative (e.g., statistical models, econometrics) and qualitative (e.g., case studies, historical analysis) research methods to study these phenomena. In doing so, they aim to generate theories and models that can help explain complex economic behavior and inform public policy decisions. By linking individual choices to larger economic systems, economists are able to shed light on some of the most pressing social issues, such as unemployment, income inequality, and environmental sustainability.

In summary, economics is considered a social science because it deals with the study of human behavior in relation to the allocation and distribution of resources. It employs scientific methods to investigate economic relationships and patterns, with the ultimate goal of improving public policy and social welfare.


Question 2: Is philosophy considered a social science?
Available choices: (A). no. (B). yes.

Answer: (A). no.

Philosophy is not considered a social science because it deals with the study of fundamental questions and concepts in areas such as existence, knowledge, logic, ethics, and aesthetics. While social sciences focus on the empirical study of human behavior and societal structures, philosophy uses critical thinking and logical arguments to explore abstract ideas and seek answers to profound questions about the nature of reality, truth, and morality.

Philosophy can be broken down into several branches, such as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics. While some branches of philosophy may occasionally intersect with social sciences, its primary method of inquiry is through rational discussion and the development of philosophical theories, rather than empirical observation and experimentation.

Although philosophy and social sciences both strive to improve our understanding of the world and human experience, they use different approaches and methods. Philosophy seeks to understand the conceptual foundations of human thought, while social sciences aim to systematically study human behavior in social contexts.


Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?

No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is asking why economics is considered a social science, while question 2 is asking whether philosophy is considered a social science or not. Both questions involve the classification of academic disciplines as social sciences, but they are focused on two different subjects - economics and philosophy.
