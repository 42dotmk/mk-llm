Question: Betty is 60 years old, and she is the oldest person in the family. Her daughter is 40 percent younger than she is, and her granddaughter is one-third her mother's age. How old is the granddaughter?
Answer: Betty's daughter is 40 / 100 * 60 = 24 years younger than she is. That means her daughter is 60 - 24 = 36 years old. So the granddaughter is 1 / 3 * 36 = 12 years old. The answer is 12.
[Question]Antonio is preparing a meal of spaghetti and meatballs for his family. His recipe for meatballs calls for 1/8 of a pound of hamburger per meatball. Antonio has 8 family members, including himself. If he uses 4 pounds of hamburger to make meatballs, and each member of the family eats an equal number of meatballs, how many meatballs will Antonio eat?
[Answer]If one meatball is made from 1 / 8 pound of hamburger meat, then 4 pounds of hamburger meat will make 4 / (1 / 8) = 4 * 8 = 32 meatballs. 32 meatballs divided amongst 8 family members is 32 / 8 = 4 meatballs per family member. The answer is 4.
Q: Jay & Gloria were hosting a 4th of July party at their house. Jay invited 22 people and Gloria invited 36. They wanted to buy small American flags for everyone. The craft store was having a sale on small flags, 5 flags for $1.00. If they wanted all of their guests to have a flag and they also wanted 1 flag each, how much would they spend at the craft store?
A: Jay invited 22 guests and Gloria invited 36 so they invited 22 + 36 = 58 guests. They also each wanted a flag so in total they would need 1 + 1 + 58 = 60 flags. The craft store has them on sale at 5 for $1.00 and they need 60 flags so the flags will cost them 60 / 5 = $12.00. The answer is 12.
Question: If a tarantula has eight legs, and one tarantula egg sac can contain 1000 tarantulas, how many baby tarantula legs would be in one less than 5 egg sacs?
Answer: One less than 5 is 5 - 1 = 4. If one tarantula egg sac can contain 1000 tarantulas, then four egg sacs can hold 4 * 1000 = 4000 tarantula babies. If each tarantula baby has eight legs, the 4 egg sacs can contain 4000 * 8 = 32,000 baby tarantula legs. The answer is 32000.
[Question]It is recommended that men should consume no more than 150 calories of added sugar per day. Mark took a soft drink in the afternoon that contained 2500 calories, 5% of which was from added sugar. Then he bought some bars of candy which had 25 calories of added sugar each. If he eventually exceeded the recommended intake of added sugar by 100%, how many bars of candy did he take?
[Answer]He consumed 2500 calories, 5% of which is added sugar to give 2500 * (5 / 100) = 125 calories of added sugar. He exceeded the recommended intake of 150 calories by 100% for a total consumption of 150 + (150(100 / 100)) = $300. This means he took in 300 - 125 = 175 calories from candy alone. Each candy had 25 calories so 175 calories which means he consumed 175 / 25 = 7 bars?. The answer is 7.
