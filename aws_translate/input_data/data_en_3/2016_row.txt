[Question]A type C school bus contains 13 rows of seats, with an aisle running down the middle of the bus, splitting each row into two sections. If the school only allowed two students to sit in each section, how many students could be seated on the bus?
[Answer]13 rows, with 2 sections per row would contain 13 * 2 = 26 sections. If two students sat per section, there would be capacity for 26 * 2 = 52 students. The answer is 52.
Q: Jeanine bought 18 pencils and Clare bought half as many pencils. If Jeanine gave one third of his pencils to Abby, how many more pencils than Clare does Jeanine have now?
A: Clare bought half of 18 pencils which is 18 / 2 = 9 pencils. One - third of 18 pencils is (1 / 3) * 18 = 6 pencils. Jeanine gave out 6 pencils so he has 18 - 6 = 12 pencils left. Jeanine now has 12 - 9 = 3 pencils. The answer is 3.
Question: Tom opens an amusement park. It cost $100,000 to open initially. It also cost 1% of that to run per day. He sells 150 tickets a day for $10 each. How long will it take to make back his money?
Answer: It cost 100,000 * .01 = $1,000 a day to keep the place open. He makes 150 * 10 = $1500 a day from the park. So he makes a profit of 1500 - 1000 = $500 a day. So it takes 100000 / 500 = 200 days to make back his money. The answer is 200.
[Question]Rick held a fundraiser and is figuring out who still owes money. He marked on a sheet how much everyone has promised to contribute, but he forgot to note how much some people had actually paid. Altogether, everyone has promised to contribute $400, and Rick has actually received $285. Sally, Amy, Derek, and Carl all still owe money. Sally and Carl both owe equal amounts, Amy owes $30, and Derek owes half as much as Amy. How much, in dollars, do Sally and Carl each owe?
[Answer]In total, Rick is still owed 400 - 285 = $115. Derek owes half as much as Amy, so he owes $30 / 2 = $15. This means that Sally and Carl owe a combined total of $115 - $30 – $15 = $70. As they owe equal amounts, they therefore owe $70 / 2 = $35 each. The answer is 35.
Q: Jenny's property tax rate is 2%. Her house is currently worth $400,000. The city is about to build a new high-speed rail project nearby, which will increase her house's value by 25%. Jenny can only afford to spend $15,000/year on property tax. How many dollars worth of improvements can she make to her house before her property tax bill gets too high?
A: First find how much the rail project will increase the house value by multiplying the initial value by 25%: $400,000 * .25 = $100,000. Then add that amount to the initial value to find the new value: $100,000 + $400,000 = $500,000. Then divide the maximum amount of property tax Jenny can afford to pay by the property tax rate to find the maximum value her house can have: $15,000 / .02 = $750,000. Now subtract the house's value after the rail project from the maximum value to find how much value the improvements can have: $750,000 - $500,000 = $250,000. The answer is 250000.
