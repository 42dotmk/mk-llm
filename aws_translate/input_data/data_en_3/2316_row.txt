The ancient Somalis and other civilizations, such as the Sabaeans, Parthians, and Axumites, competed for the wealthy Indo-Greco-Roman trade that thrived during the classical era. This period of rich international exchange, which roughly spanned from the 5th century BC to the 5th century AD, saw major powers and city-states establish a network of trade routes, connecting the Hellenistic, Indian, and Roman worlds.

The Indo-Greco-Roman trade primarily involved the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultural practices between the Indian subcontinent, the Hellenistic world (encompassing Greece, Egypt, and the Near East), and the Roman Empire. These connections were facilitated through both land routes, such as the famous Silk Road, and maritime routes across the Red Sea, Arabian Sea, and the Indian Ocean.

Various items were traded across these routes, including luxurious and exotic products that were highly sought after by the elite of different societies. Among the items exchanged were: 

1. Spices: A variety of spices from India, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and cardamom, were in great demand in the classical world, particularly in Rome where they were used in food, medicine, and religious rituals.

2. Textiles: Silk from China, cotton from India, and linens from Egypt were popular commodities for their comfort, durability, and symbolic value. Richly embroidered fabrics and clothing from the East were highly prized by nobles in the Hellenistic and Roman worlds.

3. Metals and precious stones: Gold, silver, and precious stones such as diamonds, rubies, and emeralds from India and the East Africa's Red Sea coast were highly valued for their beauty and rarity. They were used for making jewelry, coins, and other luxury items.

4. Art and artifacts: Classical Greek and Roman statues, pottery, and other artworks were sought by the elites in the eastern parts of the trade network. In return, Indian and African art, including carved ivory, textiles, and pottery, were desired by the Western cultures.

5. Knowledge and ideas: This trade network was not only focused on the exchange of material goods but also ideas, philosophies, and scientific knowledge. Concepts from Greek and Roman philosophy, mathematics, astrology, and medicine made their way into India and vice versa, enriching these realms with diverse and evolving intellectual traditions.

Ancient Somalis and other city-states situated near Cape Guardafui, such as Opone, Essina, Sarapion, Nikon, Malao, Damo, and Mosylon, played a significant role in facilitating this trade, as they provided invaluable access to maritime routes through the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Moreover, they acted as intermediaries for the exchange of goods, culture, and knowledge, positioning them as central players in the vibrant, interconnected world of the classical era.

In summary, the ancient Somalis and their neighbors competed for the wealthy Indo-Greco-Roman trade, which comprised a vast network of exchanges involving a wide range of goods, ideas, and cultural practices among the Hellenistic, Indian, and Roman worlds. These interactions over land and sea routes significantly shaped the economic, cultural, and intellectual landscape of the classical era.
