Once you've poured 2 quarts (1.89 liters) of lime putty into the bucket, the next step would involve the addition of marble dust. Start by measuring a quantity of about 1 quart (approximately 0.95 liters) of marble dust. Please note that safety is essential, so ensure you're still wearing your facemask to avoid inhaling the marble dust. If your marble dust is in larger chunks, you'll need to grind it down to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle before adding it. 

This is an important step because the marble dust acts as an aggregate, giving body and substance to the plaster. Without it, the plaster would lack the substance it needs for a good application. Slowly add it to the lime putty in your bucket or wheelbarrow and mix it thoroughly. Mixing can be done by hand using a mixing stick or an electric drill fitted with a mixing paddle. Make sure to distribute the marble dust evenly into the lime putty until the mixture has a uniform consistency.

The next step would be adding colorants.  If you desire a colored Venetian plaster, this is when to add the colorant. It's best to use a colorant that's compatible with lime products. Mix the colorant into a small amount of water before pouring it into the plaster mixture. This will help distribute the color more evenly. Use as much colorant as recommended by the manufacturer or until desired shade is achieved. Continually mix until the color is evenly distributed.

Furthermore, some people add a bit of natural soap during this step to increase workability and improve the texture of the Venetian plaster. This is optional but it could be beneficial especially for beginners. About 2 tablespoons of natural soap can be added to the mixture.

After your plaster mix is ready, let it rest for a while; usually, an hour would do, some recommend leaving it for 12 to 24 hours for the components to blend well together.

Once the wait is over, the Venetian plaster is ready for application. Using a stainless steel spatula or a trowel, you can apply the plaster onto the target surface. It is applied in thin layers and allowed to dry between coats. The number of layers applied depends on the desired effect but typically, 2-3 layers suffice.

After application, the plaster needs to be polished to bring out the shine. This is done by vigorously rubbing it with a trowel. With it shining, leave the plaster to completely dry. The drying process might take several days, but the most important thing is to ensure your plaster is completely dry.

After it completely dries, it's recommended to seal the plaster with a suitable water-based or oil-based sealer, that will protect the plaster from damage and enhance its durability, as Venetian plaster is somewhat porous and can absorb stains.

Finally, cleaning the tools after finishing the job is also an essential step to take care of. Rinse the bucket, trowels, and any mixing tools with water immediately after use, this would avoid plaster remnants hardening thus, extending the lifespan of your tools. 

It's important to remember that making and applying Venetian plaster is a hands-on job that would take a little practice to perfect, especially if you're doing colored plaster since colors may vary with each batch.
