Wearing a pocket square was considered desirable by Robert but not Michael because the two of them had markedly different fashion sensibilities, value systems, and social contexts that influenced their personal preferences when it came to accessorizing and dressing up for formal occasions.

For Robert, the pocket square was a significant aspect of his elegant, sophisticated style that he had cultivated over the years. He had a great appreciation for the finer things in life and took pride in ensuring that his outfits were meticulously coordinated and groomed to perfection. In his social and work circles, a well-dressed man donning suit with just the right pocket square was deemed to leave a remarkable impression and command respect among his peers.

Robert strongly believed that wearing a pocket square demonstrated his attention to detail, refinement, and confidence, which played an essential role in his career progression. Moreover, he found great pleasure in experimenting with a wide variety of folds and colors to express his personality and refine his signature style. For him, the pocket square symbolized both a functional and a fashionable accessory: it not only allowed him to wipe his glasses or clean his smartphone screen but also allowed him to express his creativity in the choice of fabrics, textures, and patterns to complement his formal attire.

Michael, on the other hand, had quite a different perspective when it came to fashion choices. He followed a more minimalist, understated approach to dressing. For him, the functionality and comfort of his clothing overruled any additional decorative elements such as a pocket square. He saw pocket squares as unnecessary, superfluous accessories that only served cosmetic purposes, without contributing much to practicality or the overall outfit.

Moreover, Michael was always apprehensive that the addition of a pocket square would make him appear too flashy or overdressed, thereby drawing unwanted attention and discomfort. In his view, conserving a relaxed, informal, and unpretentious demeanor was his priority even at formal events. He was more likely to express his style and preferences through the quality of his suits, the fit of his shirt, and the choice of his tie, rather than indulging in any add-on elements.

Besides, Michael's social and work circles did not assign tremendous importance to the finer details of formal dressing, so he felt no pressure to conform to the practice of wearing pocket squares despite their popularity among a certain demographic. Thus, Michael found it more aligned with his personal philosophy and ethos to avoid the use of pocket squares altogether, and instead, opted for a cleaner, subtle look that reflected his pragmatic and straightforward nature.

In conclusion, the desirability of wearing a pocket square in the given case depends largely on the individual's personal preferences, values, and social contexts that dictate their attitude towards accessories and fashion choices. While Robert saw it as a fashion enhancer that also conveyed sophistication and attention to detail, Michael considered it an unnecessary embellishment that complicated his otherwise streamlined and minimalist style.
