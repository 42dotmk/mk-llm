Q: A train takes 2 hours longer to go an equal distance of a car. If the car and the train leave station A at the same time, and the car reaches station B 4.5 hours later, calculate the combined time the car and the train take to reach station B.
A: Since the train takes 2 hours longer to go an equal distance as the car, to reach station B, the train took 4.5 + 2 = 6.5 hours. Together, the train and the car take a total of 6.5 + 4.5 = 11 hours to travel from station A to station B. The answer is 11.
Question: After being contracted to build 4000 bollards on each side of a road, a company was only able to install 3/4 of the total number of bollards required on all sides of the road. How many more bollards are they required to install on all sides of the remaining part of the road?
Answer: Since the company was contracted to build 4000 bollards on each side of a road, they were to install a total of 4000 * 2 = 8000 bollards on all sides of the road. The company was only able to install 3 / 4 * 8000 = 6000 bollards on all sides of the road. They required 8000 - 6000 = 2000 more bollards to install on all sides of the remaining part of the road. The answer is 2000.
[Question]There are 3/5 times as many people living in Boise as the number living in Seattle. There are 4000 more people in Lake View than the population in Seattle. If Lake View's population is 24000, calculate the total population of the three cities.
[Answer]If Lake View's population is 24000, then there are 24000 - 4000 = 20000 people living in Seattle. The total population of Seattle and Lake view is 20000 + 24000 = 44000. Since the population in Boise is 3 / 5 times that of Seattle, there are 3 / 5 * 20000 = 12000 people living in Boise. The three cities have a total population of 44000 + 12000 = 56000. The answer is 56000.
Q: The first tank is 300 liters filled while the second tank is 450 liters filled. The second tank is only 45% filled. If the two tanks have the same capacity, how many more liters of water are needed to fill the two tanks?
A: Since 450 liters represents 45%, then each 1% is equal to 450 liters / 45 = 10 liters. Hence, the capacity of each tank is 10 liters x 100 = 1000 liters. So, the first tank needs 1000 - 300 = 700 liters of water more. While the second tank needs 1000 - 450 = 550 liters more. Therefore, 700 + 550 = 1250 liters of water are needed to fill the two tanks. The answer is 1250.
Question: Leila spent $40 which is 1/4 of her money on a sweater. She was then left with $20 after spending the rest of her money on buying pieces of jewelry. How much more did Leila spend on jewelry than on the sweater?
Answer: Since 1 / 4 of her money is $40, then Leila originally had $40 x 4 = $160. $160 - $40 = $120 was left after buying a sweater. Since she is left with $20, Leila spent $120 - $20 = $100 on jewelry. Therefore, she spent $100 - $40 = $60 more for jewelry than on a sweater. The answer is 60.
