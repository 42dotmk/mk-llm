The two questions, "Will China become a democracy?" and "Will China ever become a true democracy?" are indeed paraphrases of each other. Both questions inquire about the possibility of China transforming its political system into a democratic one. Now, let us delve into a detailed analysis of whether China could become a democracy in the future.

China becoming a democracy is a complex topic, with many factors contributing to this discussion. At present, China operates under a one-party socialist system, with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) holding supreme authority over political, economic, and social matters. Whether China will become a democracy depends on a multitude of factors, including internal and external pressures, and the various dynamics that may drive or hinder such an outcome.

1. Economic factors:China's rapid economic growth has lifted millions out of poverty, enabling the country to become the world's second-largest economy. This economic success has bolstered the legitimacy of the CCP. However, as the Chinese middle class continues to grow, they may desire greater political freedom and representation to safeguard their economic interests. Should China face an economic downturn or if future progress slows significantly, this could create impetus for political reform.

2. Political factors: For now, the CCP remains firmly in control, suppressing dissent and political opposition. But internal divisions or dissatisfaction within the party, along with growing civil society and grassroots activism, could foster pressure for democratization. Additionally, some party members may come to believe that political reform is necessary for China's long-term stability, particularly if faced with mounting social, economic, or environmental challenges.

3. International factors: China's interactions with the rest of the world can impact the country's political trajectory. As China increases its global influence through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative, it may face pressure to adopt more democratic practices to cooperate with democratic nations or to maintain legitimacy in the international community. Conversely, China could also maintain or strengthen its authoritarian stance in response to perceived external threats or to preserve its unique political model.

4. Cultural factors: China has a long history of centralized authority and Confucian values that emphasize respect for authority and social harmony. While the younger generation appears more open to democratic principles, it is unclear whether these values will translate into political reform. Additionally, the Chinese government has promoted nationalism as a way to protect the country's sovereignty, often linking Western-style democracy to foreign intervention and instability.

In conclusion, the question of whether China will ever become a true democracy is multifaceted and remains uncertain. While there are factors that suggest potential for democratization, the Chinese Communist Party's current control over the nation's institutions and its determination to maintain power present significant challenges to the realization of a democratic system. Only time will reveal the future political direction of China.
