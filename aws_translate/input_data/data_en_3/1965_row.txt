Q: Brian loves watching animal videos online. He watches a 4-minute video of cats. He then watches a video twice as long as the cat video involving dogs. He finishes up his video watching for the day by watching a video on gorillas that's twice as long as the previous two videos combined. How many minutes does Brian spend watching animal videos?
A: Brian begins by watching a 4 - minute video, and since the second video is twice as long that means the second video is 4 * 2 = 8 minutes. The first two videos combined therefore for a 4 + 8 = 12 minute run time. Since the third video is twice as long as the first two videos put together, that means it is 12 * 2 = 24 minutes in length. The total length of time spent is therefore 24 + 12 = 36 minutes. The answer is 36.
Question: Paul lives in a 5th story apartment. He makes 3 trips out from and back to his apartment throughout the day each day of a week. How many feet does he travel vertically in total over the week if each story is 10 feet tall?
Answer: Since Paul makes 3 trips per day, and each trip involves going both down and up, this means he travels the full vertical distance of his apartment complex 3 * 2 = 6 times a day. Since there are 7 days in a week, this means he makes this trip 6 * 7 = 42 times a week. Since each story is 10 feet tall, that means with 5 stories he travels 5 * 10 = 50 feet each trip. Since he made 42 trips of 50 feet each, this means he traveled 50 * 42 = 2100 feet in a week. The answer is 2100.
[Question]Wilson decides to go sledding on some nearby hills. On the 2 tall hills, he sleds down them 4 times each and on the 3 small hills, he sled down them half as often as he sleds down the tall hills. How many times did he sled down the hills?
[Answer]On the tall hills, he sleds down 2 tall hills * 4 times per tall hill = 8 times. He sleds down the small hills half as often so he sleds down each hill 4 times per tall hill / 2 = 2 times per small hill. On the small hills, he sleds down 3 small hills * 2 times per small hill = 6 times. So in total, Wilson sled down the hills 8 times on tall hills + 6 times on small hills = 14 times. The answer is 14.
Q: Matt can paint a house in 12 hours. Patty can paint the same house in one third the time. Rachel can paint the same house in 5 more than double the amount of hours as Patty. How long will it take Rachel to paint the house?

Question: Jackson and Brandon both invest $500 in the stock market. Jackson's investment quadruples in value, while Brandon's is reduced to 20% of the initial value. How much more money does Jackson have than Brandon now?
Answer: First find the end value of Jackson's investment: $500 * 4 = $2000. Then find the end value of Brandon's investment: 20% * $500 = $100. Then subtract the value of Brandon's investment from the value of Jackson's investment to find the difference: $2000 - $100 = $1900. The answer is 1900.
