After chyme leaves the stomach, it progresses into the first section of the small intestine called the duodenum. The small intestine is a highly coiled tube approximately 20 feet (6 meters) long in adults and is divided into three sections: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. Each section performs specific digestive and absorptive functions.

When the partly digested food, now known as chyme, exits the stomach through the pyloric sphincter, it mixes with potent digestive enzymes and bicarbonate solution secreted by the pancreas, as well as bile produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. This process occurs in the duodenum, which is about 10 to 12 inches (25-30 cm) in length. These secretions help neutralize the acidic chyme, preparing it for nutrient absorption and further digestion.

Pancreatic enzymes, including amylase, protease, and lipase, play a crucial role in the breakdown of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in the chyme. Bile, on the other hand, serves to emulsify fat globules, making them more accessible to lipid-digesting enzymes for absorption. The duodenum also secretes enzymes such as maltase, sucrase, and lactase, acting on disaccharides and breaking them down into simpler sugars that can be absorbed by the body.

Once the nutrients are broken down into simpler forms, they are absorbed by tiny, finger-like projections called villi and microvilli that line the small intestine's walls. The nutrients are then transferred into the blood or lymph vessels, depending on their molecular properties.

Blood vessels absorb water-soluble nutrients such as sugars, amino acids, and water-soluble vitamins (such as Vitamin C and B vitamins). These nutrients are transported via the hepatic portal vein to the liver in the portal circulation for further processing, detoxification, or storage before being sent back into the bloodstream.

The lymphatic vessels absorb fat-soluble nutrients, such as fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins (like Vitamin A, D, E, and K), and cholesterol. These nutrients are absorbed into the lymphatic system as chylomicrons, which eventually enter the bloodstream through the thoracic duct.

After the breakdown and absorption process in the duodenum, the chyme progresses through the jejunum and then the ileum. The jejunum (about 8 feet or 2.5 meters long) and ileum (about 11 feet or 3.5 meters long) primarily function in the absorption of nutrients, especially the remaining nutrients that were not absorbed in the duodenum.

Lastly, the remaining undigested chyme enters the large intestine, primarily composed of water, electrolytes, and indigestible substances. The large intestine absorbs water, electrolytes, and vitamins produced by bacterial fermentation, while also forming and storing feces to be eliminated through the rectum and anus.

In summary, once chyme leaves the stomach, it moves into the duodenum where it is further broken down and mixed with digestive enzymes and bile. The chyme then journeys through the small intestine, where nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream and lymphatic system before entering the large intestine, where water and electrolytes are absorbed, ultimately resulting in the formation and excretion of feces.
