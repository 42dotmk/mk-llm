Reasoning and answer: The farmer has 125 cows because 50 / .4 = 125. The farmer has 75 female cows because 125 x .6 = 75. The farmer will get 150 gallons of milk a day because 75 x 2 = 150.
The answer: 150

When 43 books were checked out on Wednesday, Suzy remained with 98 - 43 = 55 books. After 23 books were returned on Thursday, she ended with 55 + 23 = 78 books. However, 5 books were checked out on the same day meaning that 78 - 5 = 73 books were left. After 7 books were returned on Friday, Suzy had 73 + 7 = 80 books.
The answer: 80
Reverse engineering the question: When Suzy the librarian sat at her desk on Wednesday morning, she had 98 books ready for checkout. The same day, 43 books were checked out. The following day, 23 books were returned, but 5 books were checked out. On Friday, 7 books were returned. How many books did Suzy have?

Reasoning and answer: They approved 20% off of the $20.00 item so .20 * 20 = $4.00. The item has a $4.00 discount which can be applied from his final total of $54.00 so 54 - 4 = $50.00. Now he can use his 10% coupon on the $50.00 total so .10 * 50 = $5.00. The total was $50.00 but his $5.00 discount now makes it 50 - 5 = $45.00.
The answer: 45

Reasoning and answer: Of her original 25 apples, Sarah gave five to friends, meaning she has no more than 25 - 5 = 20 apples available to give to teachers. She ate one while walking home, meaning she had no more than 20 - 1 = 19 apples available to give to teachers. And since she had three apples remaining when she got home, then the amount she had given to teachers was 19 - 3 = 16 apples.
The answer: 16
