First, calculate how many square feet of road Mark needs to cover by multiplying the length by the width: 2000 feet * 20 feet = 40,000 sq ft. Then divide the square footage of road by the number of square feet each truckload will cover: 40,000 sq ft / 800 sq ft / truckload = 50 truckloads. Now multiply the number of truckloads by the cost per truckload: $75 / truckload * 50 truckloads = $3750. Now calculate the sales tax by multiplying $3750 by 20%: $3750 * .2 = $750. Now add the sales tax to the cost of the asphalt to find the total: $750 + $3750 = $4500.
The answer: 4500
Reverse engineering the question: Mark is buying asphalt to pave a new section of road. The road will be 2000 feet long and 20 feet wide. Each truckload of asphalt will cover 800 square feet of road. If each truckload costs $75, and there's a 20% sales tax, how much will Mark need to pay for asphalt?

Reasoning and answer: First find the total number of calories in the bacon: 125 calories + 125 calories = 250 calories. Then divide the number of bacon calories by the total number of calories and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 250 calories / 1250 calories * 100% = 20%.
The answer: 20

Reasoning and answer: She makes $10.00 an hour for 2 hours walking dogs so she makes 10 * 2 = $20.00 every morning. Over 7 days she makes 7 * 20 = $140.00 a week. She makes $12.50 for 2 hours working at a card shop so she makes 12.5 * 2 = $25.00. She works there 5 days a week so she makes 5 * 25 = $125.00 a week. She also babysits for 4 hours making $10.00 an hour for a total of 4 * 10 = $40.00. Over 7 days, she makes 140 + 125 + 40 = $305.00.
The answer: 305
