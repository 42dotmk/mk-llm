Lem, given his unique expertise, takes it upon himself to help facilitate discussions and mediations between the two races for a peaceful resolution.

However, the ambitious General Grawl, who is assigned to maintain order on Sollaria, mistrusts Lem and begins to see him as an interference for his own plans to seize control of the energy source. Fueled by his deep-seated fears and paranoia surrounding the intentions of extraterrestrial beings, General Grawl not only views the aliens as a threat to humanity but also Lem as a potential traitor.

In order to maintain his secret motives, General Grawl takes advantage of the ongoing chaos and labels Lem as "Alien Invader," accusing him of conspiring with the alien races against Earth's interests. Lem suddenly finds himself under attack, not only from General Grawl and his supporters but also from the alien races who begin to distrust him as a result of Grawl's propaganda.
