Title: Leveraging Existing Drugs: A Cheaper and Faster Approach to Tackle Dementia?

Alzheimer’s Society, a leading charity organization working towards a world without dementia, has recently proposed an innovative approach towards handling this devastating condition - using drugs that are already available on the market. The society posits that this could potentially offer a quicker and more cost-effective solution to mitigating the impact of dementia, an idea that is opening a fresh avenue in the world of dementia research. 

The Alzheimer's Society, ground-breaking in its endeavor, believes in not underestimating the power of drugs we already possess. With its focus on drugs developed for other ailments, this perspective perhaps maximizes the utilization of our current arsenal in the healthcare sector. 

The rationale behind this method lies in its potential cost-effectiveness and speed. Development of new drugs requires considerable resources, both in terms of time and finance. By employing existing medicines, any auxiliary costs associated with research, development, and testing could be significantly reduced. Furthermore, the lengthy process of approval can also be circumvented, accelerating the speed at which these drugs reach the patients in need.

The society highlighted two major types of already available drugs: those used in the treatment of acne and psoriasis. This brings hope for the possibilities these drugs can provide in the field where new, effective treatments are urgently needed. The organization suggests that these medicines, originally designed to treat skin conditions, might be repurposed to manage dementia, adding more weapons to the world's anti-dementia arsenal. 

On an ending note, while this innovative approach holds promise, it’s merely a potential idea just yet. It needs to be fortified by rigorous scientific research to reveal any side effects and determine the efficacy of these drugs for dementia. The prospect of finding faster, cheaper treatments for dementia marks an exciting turning point, which is only possible because of the relentless pursuit of solutions by organizations like Alzheimer's Society.

In conclusion, Alzheimer's Society's novel approach could potentially change the game in dementia treatments. Their advocating for the use of existing drugs, like those for acne and psoriasis provides a platform for quicker, cheaper intervention. It's a path that could lead humanity to the much-needed breakthrough in the ongoing fight against dementia.
