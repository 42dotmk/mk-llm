[Question]Mark wants to order a pair of slippers for his wife with her initials embroidered on top. The slippers are currently $50.00 and are 10% off. The embroidery will be $5.50 per shoe and shipping is a flat rate of $10.00. How much will the slippers cost?
[Answer]The slippers are $50.00 and currently 10% off so thatâ€™s 50 * .10 = $5.00 discount. The slippers are $50.00 with a $5.00 discount which makes them 50 - 5 = $45.00. The embroidery will be $5.50 per shoe, and 2 shoes make a pair so it will cost 5.50 * 2 = $11.00. The shoes are on sale for $45.00, the embroidery will be $11.00 and the shipping is $10.00 for a total of 45 + 11 + 10 = $66.00. The answer is 66.
Q: A company hires employees on a contract basis, depending on the availability of work. In a particular month, they hired 200 more employees on the first week than on the second week, and 150 fewer employees on the second week than on the third week. If the number of employees hired on the fourth week was twice the number hired in the third week, and the number of employees on the fourth week was 400, what's the average number of employees hired per week?
A: The fourth week had twice the number of employees as the third week, so 400 / 2 = 200 employees on the third week. In the third week, they hired 150 fewer employees than on the second week, that is 200 - 150 = 50 employees hired on the second week. The first week had 200 more hirings than the second week, that is 50 + 200 = 250 employees. The total number of employees hired is 250 + 50 + 200 + 400 = 900. The average number of employees hired per week is 900 / 4 = 225 employees. The answer is 225.
Question: Every year 20 ducks from a flock are killed but another 30 are born. The original flock size is 100 ducks. After 5 years they join with another flock of 150 ducks. How many ducks are in the combined flock?
Answer: The original flock gains 30 - 20 = 10 ducks per year. So after 5 years they have gained 10 * 5 = 50 ducks. So the original flock has 100 + 50 = 150 ducks. So the combined flock has 150 + 150 = 300 ducks. The answer is 300.
[Question]The toothpaste in Anne's family's bathroom contains 105 grams. Anne's dad uses 3 grams at each brushing, her mom uses 2 grams, Anne and her brother use 1 gram each. Each member of the family brushes their teeth three times a day. How many days will it take for the toothpaste to run out?
[Answer]Anne and her brother use 1 gram + 1 gram = 2 grams. Anne's dad uses 3 grams and Anne's mom uses 2 grams so together they use 2 grams + 3 grams + 2 grams = 7 grams / wash. Each day, the family uses 7 grams / wash * 3 washes / day = 21 grams. Using that amount daily, the toothpaste will last 105 grams / 21 grams / day = 5 days. The answer is 5.
Q: A garden produced 237 potatoes, 60 fewer cucumbers and twice as many peppers than the cucumbers. How many vegetables did the garden produce?
A: The garden produced 237 potatoes - 60 = 177 cucumbers. The garden produced 177 cucumbers * 2 peppers / cucumber = 354 peppers. The garden produced 237 potatoes + 177 cucumbers + 354 peppers = 768 vegetables. The answer is 768.
