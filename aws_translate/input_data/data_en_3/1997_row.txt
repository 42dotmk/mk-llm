Question: If Billy and Jenny each order a $20 steak along with a $5 drink, how much will Billy have to pay in tips if he wants to cover 80% of a 20% tip for the two of them?
Answer: First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20 + 5 = 25 per meal. Then we multiply this by 2, as there are two people eating, meaning a total cost of 25 * 2 = 50 for both meals. Then we find the total tip amount for a 20% tip, by multiplying 50 * .2 = 10. Then we find out what 80% of this tip amount is by multiplying the desired tip of 10 by .8, finding 10 * .8 = 8 dollars that Billy should contribute. The answer is 8.
[Question]Jeff makes 10 donuts each day for 12 days. Jeff eats one of the donuts each day. Chris then comes over and eats 8 donuts. If 10 donuts fit in each box, how many boxes can Jeff fill with his donuts?
[Answer]Jeff makes a total of 10 * 12 = 120 donuts. Jeff eats 1 * 12 = 12 donuts. After Chris is done eating, there are 120 - 12 - 8 = 100 donuts remaining. Jeff needs 100 / 10 = 10 boxes to store all of his donuts. The answer is 10.
Q: Carrie works for $8 an hour and 35 hours a week at her job. It’s been a month since she started working there. She has saved up all of her money because she wants to buy a bike for $400. How much money will she have left over after she buys her bike?
A: It will be easy to solve the problem by first calculating how much money she makes in a week at her job by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours she works in a week: $8 * 35 = $280 in a week. The weekly earnings need to be multiplied by the number of weeks in a month to get how much she made in a month: $280 * 4 = $1120. The bike’s cost must be subtracted from her earnings made in a month to get how much money is left over after purchasing the bike: $1120 - $400 = $720 is left over after purchasing her bike. The answer is 720.
Question: Rafael works 10 hours on Monday and 8 hours on Tuesday on his delivery job. With 20 hours left to work in the week, how much money does Rafael make if he is paid $20 per hour?
Answer: The total number of hours that Rafael has worked by Tuesday is 8 + 10 = 18 hours. To complete his assigned work hours, Rafael works 20 hours more, making his total weekly hours to be 18 + 20 = 38 hours. Since he is paid $20 per hour, he makes $20 * 38 = $760 a week. The answer is 760.
[Question]A certain tree was 100 meters tall at the end of 2017. It will grow 10% more than its previous height each year. How long has the tree grown from 2017 until the end of 2019?
[Answer]At the end of 2018, the tree will grow 100 x 10 / 100 = 10 meters more. Thus, its height at the end of 2018 is 100 + 10 = 110 meters. At the end of 2019, the tree will grow 110 x 10 / 100 = 11 meters more. So, its height at the end of 2019 is 110 + 11 = 121 meters. Therefore, the tree has grown 121 - 100 = 21 meters. The answer is 21.
