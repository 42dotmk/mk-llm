(CNN) -- Early Sunday, as the sun ascended to the winter sky, the very last American convoy made its way down the main highway that connects Iraq and Kuwait. The military called it its final "tactical road march." A series of 110 heavily armored, hulking trucks and Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles carrying about 500 soldiers streamed slowly but steadily out of the combat zone. A few minutes before 8 a.m., the metal gate behind the last MRAP closed. With it came to an end a deadly and divisive war that lasted almost nine years, its enormous cost calculated in blood and billions.

The quiet American exit, shrouded in secrecy until it occurred, closes a war that was contentious from the start and cost the nation more than $800 billion. The decision to invade Iraq was met with both support and opposition, but as the years went on and casualties mounted, the war's true costs became increasingly apparent. The conflict resulted in the deaths of over 4,400 American soldiers, tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians, and the displacement of millions more. The human toll, combined with the financial burden and the region's ongoing instability, has left many questioning whether the sacrifice was worthwhile.

Throughout the course of the war, the U.S. faced numerous challenges, including managing a complex and evolving insurgency, addressing serious sectarian strife within the country, and attempting to promote stability and democratic governance in a region plagued by constant upheaval. The training and equipping of Iraqi security forces was often a slow and arduous process. Additionally, strained relations with the Iraqi government and an increasing war-weariness among the American public significantly contributed to the pressure on the U.S. military to withdraw.

As the final American convoy exited Iraq, the remaining troops reflected on their experiences and sacrifices. Many expressed mixed emotions about leaving, with some highlighting concerns that the country might not yet be prepared to handle the daunting task of maintaining its own stability and security without international assistance. At the same time, many soldiers expressed a sense of relief and accomplishment, having played a role in toppling a brutal regime and giving the Iraqi people a chance to rebuild their nation.

The withdrawal marked the end of an era in American military operations and a contentious period in U.S. foreign policy. The consequences and lasting effects of the war will undoubtedly continue to be debated for years to come. As soldiers return home to reunite with their loved ones, the legacy of the war will remain ever-present in the lives of those who fought, those who lost, and those who were forever changed by the conflict.

In the years following the withdrawal, the U.S. has continued to grapple with the repercussions of its actions in Iraq. The rise of ISIS and the continued instability in the region have underscored the ongoing challenges of crafting effective policies in an increasingly interconnected and volatile world. The lessons learned from the conflict in Iraq will undoubtedly continue to inform and shape American foreign policy, with the true consequences of the war still unfolding.
