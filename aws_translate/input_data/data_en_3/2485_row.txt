[Question]The average temperature in Orlando in a particular week was 60 degrees. If the temperature on each of the first 3 days in that week was 40, and the temperature for Thursday and Friday was 80 degrees each, calculate the total temperature of the remaining days of that week.
[Answer]If the average temperature of Orlando for the week was 60, then the total temperature for the week was 7 * 60 = 420 degrees. For the first three days of that week, the temperature was 40 degrees each day, totaling 3 * 40 = 120 degrees in the three days. The temperature for Thursday and Friday was 80 degrees each, a total of 80 * 2 = 160 degrees. The temperature of Orlando for the first five days was 160 + 120 = 280 degrees. The temperature for the remaining two days is 420 - 280 = 140 degrees. The answer is 140.
Q: Travis is hired to take 638 bowls from the factory to the home goods store. The home goods store will pay the moving company a $100 fee, plus $3 for every bowl that is delivered safely. Travis must pay the home goods store $4 each for any bowls that are lost or broken. If 12 bowls are lost, 15 bowls are broken, and the rest are delivered safely, how much should Travis be paid?
A: Travis has lost or broken 12 + 15 = 27 bowls. Travis will need to pay the store 27 x $4 = $108 dollars. Travis has safely taken 638 - 27 = 611 bowls. For this, he will be paid 611 x $3 = $1833 dollars. In total Travis will be paid $1833 + $100 = $1933 dollars. Since Travis has to pay the home goods 108 for the broken and lost bowls, he will end up with $1933 - $108 = $1825. The answer is 1825.
Question: Mark wants to have a water balloon fight with his friends. He goes to the store to buy balloons and sees that they sell small bags for $4, medium bags for $6 and extra large bags for $12. He has $24 and wants to get the most balloons as possible. If the $4 bags contain 50 balloons, the $6 bags contain 75 balloons and the $12 bags contain 200 balloons, what is the greatest number of balloons he can buy?
Answer: He can buy 6 small bags because 24 / 4 = 6. These give him 300 balloons, because 6 x 50 = 300. He can buy 4 medium bags because 24 / 6 = 4. These give him 300 balloons because 4 x 75 = 300. He can buy 2 extra large bags because 24 / 12 = 2. This gives him 400 balloons because 2 x 200 = 400. 400 is the most he can buy because 400 is greater than 300. The answer is 400.
[Question]Marco uses a fifth of an ounce of dry tea leaves to brew his morning cup of tea each day. He buys tea leaves in boxes of 28 ounces. How many weeks of daily tea does Marco get from a box?
