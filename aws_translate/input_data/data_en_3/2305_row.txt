Question: A group of security guards were hired for the night shift at a factory. The four guards agreed to a rotating schedule to cover the nine hours of the night shift. The first guard would take three hours since they were still awake, the last guard would wake up early and take two hours, and the middle two guards would split the remaining hours. How many hours will each middle guard take?
Answer: The first and last guard will take 3 + 2 = 5 hours of the night shift. There are 9 hours in the night shift, so the middle two guards will cover 9 - 5 = 4 hours. Each middle guard will take 4 / 2 = 2 hours. The answer is 2.
[Question]John works at 2 different hospitals. At the first hospital, he sees 20 different patients each day. At the second hospital, he sees 20% more individual patients a day. He works 5 days a week. How many patients does he treat a year if he works 50 weeks a year?
[Answer]He treats 20 * .2 = 4 extra patients. So he treats 20 + 4 = 24 patients at the second hospital. So he treats 20 + 24 = 44 patients a day. That means he treats 44 * 5 = 220 patients a week. So he treats 220 * 50 = 11,000 patients a year. The answer is 11000.

Question: Fran is in charge of counting votes for the book club's next book, but she always cheats so her favorite gets picked. Originally, there were 10 votes for Game of Thrones, 12 votes for Twilight, and 20 votes for The Art of the Deal. Fran throws away 80% of the votes for The Art of the Deal and half the votes for Twilight. What percentage of the altered votes were for Game of Thrones?
Answer: First find the total number of The Art of the Deal votes Fran throws away: 80% * 20 votes = 16 votes. Then subtract these votes from the total number of The Art of the Deal votes to find the altered number: 20 votes - 16 votes = 4 votes. Then divide the total number Twilight votes by 2 to find the altered number of votes: 12 votes / 2 = 6 votes. Then add the altered number of votes for each book to find the total altered number of votes: 6 votes + 4 votes + 10 votes = 20 votes. Then divide the number of votes for Game of Thrones by the total altered number of votes and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 10 votes / 20 votes * 100% = 50%. The answer is 50.
