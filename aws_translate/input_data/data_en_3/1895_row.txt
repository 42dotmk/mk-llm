Hariri's Future Movement took to the streets in protest of Mikati's appointment. The protesters expressed their frustration and anger at what they perceive as a hostile takeover by Hezbollah and its allies, threatening Lebanon's already fragile political stability. The protests soon spread to other parts of the country, with tensions escalating to burning tires, vandalizing public properties, and clashes with security forces. Lebanese authorities were quick to respond, deploying military and police units to maintain order and restore calm in the affected areas.

As the situation unfolded, international reactions varied. The United States expressed concern over the developments in Lebanon, calling on all parties to respect democratic principles and work towards political stability. European leaders urged Lebanon's new government to maintain its commitment to the United Nations-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon, which is investigating the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, Saad Hariri's father. This investigation has further polarized Lebanon's political landscape, as several Hezbollah members have been implicated in the assassination.

Mikati, a billionaire businessman with political experience, has faced skepticism in his new role as prime minister. Critics argue that his appointment, backed by Hezbollah and its allies, is a clear indication of the group's growing influence over Lebanon's political affairs and a shift away from a pro-Western stance that his predecessor, Saad Hariri, had maintained. On the other hand, Mikati's supporters maintain that he is a moderate leader who seeks to unite Lebanon and act in the country's best interests.

In a bid to address the concerns of the protesting citizens and international observers, Mikati promised to work for the benefit of Lebanon and strive to maintain its sovereignty. He stressed that his government would focus on socioeconomic and security issues, reassuring them that he would uphold democratic principles and prevent foreign interference in Lebanon's internal affairs.

Despite these assurances, it remains to be seen how the new government will navigate the many challenges facing Lebanon. Political divisions run deep in the country, with various factions still heavily armed and maintaining influence over different areas, much to the detriment of the central government. The country's economic crisis has also intensified, with rampant inflation, high unemployment rate, and a worsening public debt situation. To make matters worse, Lebanon's fragile political landscape is further complicated by sectarian tensions and a history of foreign intervention, most notably by Syria and Iran.

As Mikati forms his government and begins to address these myriad challenges, both the Lebanese people and the international community will be watching closely to see if he can successfully strike a balance between the competing interests and maintain stability in this volatile region. Over the upcoming year, Lebanon's citizens will have the chance to judge Mikati's leadership and decide if he can indeed overcome the power struggles and deliver on his promises of a brighter future for the country.
