Question: Sofia and her mother go to the grocery store and buys 10kgs of oranges to be used in their home for the week. While at the store, Sofia's father calls and says they're to add 5 more kgs since their neighbor also wanted some supplies. When they reach home, they estimated that for the next coming two weeks they'll have to buy twice as many oranges each week for the supplies to be enough. What the total quantity of oranges they would have bought after the three weeks.
Answer: For the first week, they bought 10 + 5 = 15kgs. For the next week, they bought twice the quantity of oranges which is 2 * 15 = 30kgs. For the next two weeks, the total quantity of oranges bought is 30 * 2 = 60 kgs. The total quantity for the three weeks is 60 + 15 = 75 kgs. The answer is 75.
[Question]Jessica is having a sweet tooth and bought 10 chocolate bars, 10 packs of gummy bears, and 20 bags of chocolate chips. Her total rang up to $150. If the cost of a pack of gummy bears is $2 and a bag of chocolate chips costs $5, how much does 1 chocolate bar cost?
[Answer]The gummy bears cost 10 * 2 = $20. The chocolate chips cost 5 * 20 = $100. The total cost for these two is 100 + 20 = $120. The chocolate bars in total cost 150 - 120 = $30. A single chocolate bar costs 30 / 10 = $3. The answer is 3.
Q: Jackson wants to go on a shopping spree, so his mom says she will give him some spending money if he does extra chores. She promises $5 per hour spent on chores. Jackson spends 2 hours vacuuming, and decides to do this twice. He also spends 0.5 hours washing dishes, and three times as long cleaning the bathroom. How much spending money has Jackson earned?
A: Jackson spent a total of 2 * 2 = 4 hours vacuuming. This means he earned 4 * $5 = 20 dollars from vacuuming. He earned 0.5 * $5 = 2.5 dollars from washing dishes. Cleaning the bathroom took three times as long as the dishes, so he spent 0.5 * 3 = 1.5 hours in the bathroom. This means he earned 1.5 * $5 = $7.5 from cleaning the bathroom. In total, he has earned $20 + $2.5 + $7.5 = $30. The answer is 30.
Question: Oliver has $40 and 200 quarters. If he gives his sister $5 and 120 quarters, how much money in total is he left with?
Answer: The 200 quarters equals 200 * $0.25 = $50. Oliver has a total of $40 + $50 = $90. He gives his sister 120 * $0.25 = $30 in total from the quarters. The total amount he gave to his sister is $30 + $5 = $35. Oliver is left with $90 - $35 = $55. The answer is 55.
[Question]John bakes 12 coconut macaroons, each weighing 5 ounces. He then packs an equal number of the macaroons in 4 different brown bags, ready for delivery. When he briefly leaves the kitchen to pick the phone, his little brother Steve eats the entire contents of one of the brown bags. What is the total weight, in ounces, of the remaining coconut macaroons?
[Answer]Each brown bag has 12 / 4 = 3 macaroons. After Steve eats a bag, there are 12 - 3 = 9 macaroons left. The total weight is therefore 9 * 5 = 45 ounces. The answer is 45.
