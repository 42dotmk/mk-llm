Based on the context provided within the question and the possible answer choices, it seems highly likely that Jenny is at an office. Here is an extensive explanation to support the answer:

First and foremost, the statement "Jenny answered the phone because this was what she did for a living" implies that answering the phone is her profession, which is a crucial part of her daily work activities. Such tasks are generally associated with administrative or customer service occupations, such as a receptionist, secretary, or call center operator, among others. Typically, these types of jobs are located in an office setting.

Furthermore, the question mentions that Jenny "took a message and passed it on", indicating that her responsibility is to relay crucial information between different people, which is a common practice in an office environment. Office work often requires effective communication and organization, and having someone to manage phone calls can facilitate the flow of information within the company. 

Additionally, the message she passed on was "important, about a big project." Projects, especially big ones, often take place in professional settings where planning, coordination, and teamwork occur, such as in an office. This further reinforces the idea that the environment in which Jenny is working is that of an office.

Now, let's analyze the other possible answer choices to understand why they are less suitable options compared to the choice of "office":

1. Friend's house - While it is possible for people to take phone calls or work remotely from a friend's house, it is highly unlikely that the context of the question points to Jenny doing her job on a regular basis from such a place. Making a living from answering phone calls at a friend's house seems implausible.

2. Hotel - It is true that some occupations involve working in a hotel, like a hotel receptionist or concierge. However, considering the overall context of the question, the term "office" seems more applicable and broadly accurate. Additionally, one could argue that a hotel's reception or front desk is an office-like setting. Therefore, between the two choices, "office" better encompasses Jenny's workplace.

3. School - Although answering phone calls may occur in a school setting (such as by a school receptionist or administrator), the context of the question focuses on an important message "about a big project." This statement is associated more with an office environment than a school.

4. Party - This answer seems highly unlikely given that the context states "Jenny answered the phone because this was what she did for a living." A party is generally a social, non-professional setting that doesn't align well with the notion of earning a living by answering phone calls.

In conclusion, when considering Jenny's professional duties, the nature of the message she passed on, and the potential of other given locations, it is evident that the correct answer should be "office." This choice accurately describes an environment where Jenny could fulfill her responsibility of answering the phone, receive and distribute crucial information, and work on important projects as her primary job function.
