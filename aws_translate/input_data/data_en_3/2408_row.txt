The Ironton Railroad became part of the Conrail Corporation, which was a Class 1 Railroad Corporation in the United States. To provide a detailed and historical context to this answer, let us first understand the journey of the Ironton Railroad, its connections with other railroads, and how it eventually became part of the Conrail Corporation.

Founded in 1861, the Ironton Railroad was initially created to transport iron ore from the various iron mines near Ironton, Pennsylvania to the Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR) at Catasauqua. In its early years, the railroad primarily served as a short line railroad and was only 9.2 miles long. Nevertheless, the Ironton Railroad played a crucial role in supporting the local iron industry, which was a vital part of the economy in the region.

Over the years, the business of the Ironton Railroad expanded as it connected to other important railroads and industries. Although the rail line was initially constructed to transport iron ore, it later began handling coal, cement, and even passengers. By the 20th century, due to industrial progress and the decline of the iron industry in the region, the railroad started to see a decrease in the transportation of iron and subsequently shifted its focus to other freight traffic.

In 1902, the Ironton Railroad leased its line to the Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR), which significantly connected the railroads and contributed to the Ironton Railroad's extents and exposure to larger markets. The Lehigh Valley Railroad operated and expanded the Ironton line, and by this time, the cement industry had become a prominent source of revenue for the Ironton railroad, substituting its earlier focus on iron transportation.

However, the existence of the Lehigh Valley Railroad itself was turbulent. The LVRR faced bankruptcy and financial difficulties during the mid-20th century. After a series of attempts to maintain the railroad, the LVRR was finally declared bankrupt in 1970, and its operations were eventually merged with other bankrupt northeastern railroads. This merging resulted in the creation of a new Class 1 Railroad Corporation, the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail), in 1976. Conrail was established by the United States government to salvage and reconsolidate the rail services in the northeastern region for better efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

As a result, the Ironton Railroad, through its connections and lease agreement with the Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR), became a part of the Conrail Corporation. After becoming one of the Class 1 railroads under Conrail, the Ironton Railroad continued to operate as an essential line for freight traffic services, transporting cement and other essential commodities in the region.

In conclusion, the Ironton Railroad, which initially started as an iron ore transportation service, got connected with other major railroads and evolved in terms of its services and extent. The integration of the Ironton Railroad with the Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR) was crucial in its growth, and as LVRR eventually became a part of the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) in 1976, the Ironton Railroad also joined the Conrail Corporation, thus becoming a part of a Class 1 Railroad Corporation.
