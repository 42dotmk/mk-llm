Q: A TV show costs $100,000 per episode for the first season and twice that much for every other season. The first season had 12 episodes, and every season after that had 50% more episodes except the last season, which had 24 episodes. The show had 5 seasons. How much did it cost to produce all the episodes?
A: The first season cost 12 * 100,000 = $1,200,000. Season 2 - 4 had 12 * .5 = 6 more episodes per season than the first. So they each had 12 + 6 = 18 episodes. That means there were 18 * 3 + 24 = 78 episodes in the last 4 seasons. So those episodes cost 2 * 100,000 = $200,000. For a total cost of 200,000 * 78 = $15,600,000. So the total cost was 15,600,000 + 1,200,000 = $16,800,000. The answer is 16800000.
Question: In 2004, there were 60 kids at a cookout. In 2005, half the number of kids came to the cookout as compared to 2004. In 2006, 2/3 as many kids came to the cookout as in 2005. How many kids came to the cookout in 2006?
Answer: In 2005, 60 / 2 = 30 kids came to the cookout. In 2006, 30 / 3 * 2 = 20 kids came to the cookout. The answer is 20.
[Question]Anne drops a mirror and breaks it into 60 pieces. She sweeps up half of them, then her cat steals 3 pieces and her boyfriend picks up 1/3 of the remaining pieces. How many pieces does her boyfriend pick up?
[Answer]First find the number of pieces left after Anne sweeps up: 60 pieces / 2 = 30 pieces. Then subtract the number her cat takes: 30 pieces - 3 pieces = 27 pieces. Divide that number by 3 to find how many pieces her boyfriend picks up: 27 pieces / 3 = 9 pieces. The answer is 9.
Q: Barry stands on his head for 10 minutes at a time, but then he must sit for 5 minutes before he can take another turn standing on his head. How many turns can Barry take standing on his head during a single 2-hour period?
A: Each turn Barry takes standing on his head lasts for 10 + 5 = 15 minutes. 2 hours is 60 * 2 = 120 minutes. Barry can take 120 / 15 = 8 turns standing on his head over two hours. The answer is 8.
Question: Gilbert, the bearded dragon, eats 4 crickets per week when the temperature averages 90 degrees F per day, but he eats twice as many crickets per week when the temperature averages 100 degrees F. How many crickets will he eat over 15 weeks if the temperature averages 90 degrees F for 80% of the time, and 100 degrees F for the remainder of the time?
Answer: It will be 90 degrees for 80% of the 15 weeks, for a total of 0.8 * 15 = 12 weeks. It will be 100 degrees F for the remainder of the 15 weeks, or 15 - 12 = 3 weeks. During the 12 weeks when it averages 90 degrees F, he will eat 4 crickets per week for a total of 12 * 4 = 48 crickets. When it averages 100 degrees F, he eats twice as many crickets per week as when it averages 90 degrees F per week, for a total of 2 * 4 = 8 crickets per week. During these 3 weeks, he will eat 8 * 3 = 24 crickets. Therefore, over the 15 weeks, he will eat a total of 48 + 24 = 72 crickets. The answer is 72.
