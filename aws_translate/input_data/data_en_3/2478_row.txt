The element added to steel to make it stainless is chromium. Stainless steel is a versatile and widely used material known for its corrosion resistance, durability, and ease of maintenance. The development of stainless steel is primarily attributed to the addition of a minimum of 10.5% chromium to the iron and carbon combination found in ordinary steel.

Chromium's function in stainless steel is multifaceted. Firstly, it helps form a thin, stable, and continuous surface layer of chromium oxide (Cr2O3). This layer develops spontaneously when stainless steel comes into contact with oxygen, either from the air or via water. The chromium oxide layer is capable of self-repair, meaning that if it is damaged, a new layer will form quickly to restore its protective capacity. This passive layer prevents further corrosion and protects the base metal from deteriorating due to chemical reactions with the environment.

The effectiveness of chromium in creating the protective oxide layer is directly related to the concentration of chromium in the steel. Higher chromium content results in better corrosion resistance. For example, while a minimum of 10.5% chromium is necessary for stainless steel, many grades contain much higher chromium levels (up to around 26% in some cases) to provide increased corrosion resistance for more demanding applications.

Aside from chromium, other elements are often added to stainless steel to enhance its performance and tailor its properties for specific applications. Some of these important alloying elements include:

1. Nickel (Ni): Added to improve overall corrosion resistance, mechanical properties, and formability. Nickel also stabilizes the austenitic crystal structure, one of the primary microstructures found in stainless steel.

2. Molybdenum (Mo): Increases pitting and crevice corrosion resistance, particularly in chlorides, making the steel suitable for marine and chemical processing applications.

3. Titanium (Ti) and Niobium (Nb): Added to stabilize the steel when carbon content is higher to prevent intergranular corrosion, which can occur when the material is heated or cooled.

4. Manganese (Mn) and Nitrogen (N): Used to replace some nickel content in certain stainless steel grades, helping to reduce cost while maintaining desirable properties.

5. Carbon (C): Present in most stainless steels in small amounts, but excessive carbon can contribute to the formation of chromium carbide and intergranular corrosion. Hence, low-carbon stainless steel options, known as L-grades like 304L and 316L, are available for corrosive environments.

These various alloying elements enable the creation of a vast array of stainless steel grades with characteristics suited for different applications, spanning from everyday items like cutlery and kitchen appliances to more demanding uses in chemical processing, aerospace, and construction industries.

In summary, chromium is the key element added to steel to make it stainless. This element creates an oxide layer that prevents corrosion and provides characteristic properties such as durability and resistance to the stainless steel. Various other alloying elements can also be added to further optimize the material for specific applications.
