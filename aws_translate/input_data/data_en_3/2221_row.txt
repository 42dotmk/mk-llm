Backward time travel has been a captivating concept for centuries, often featured in science fiction literature and films. The possibility of traveling into the past raises numerous paradoxes and complexities, which have challenged scientists and philosophers alike.

To evaluate the possibility of backward time travel, we need to rely on our existing scientific understanding of space and time. According to Albert Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, space and time are interconnected and form a four-dimensional fabric called spacetime. Massive objects, such as planets and stars, curve this fabric, which gives rise to the force of gravity. Time dilation, a phenomenon predicted by Einstein's theory, occurs when an object's velocity or the presence of a strong gravitational field affects its passage through time relative to an object at rest or in a weaker field. This has been experimentally tested and confirmed, and opens the door for the possibility of time travel under the right conditions.

Einstein’s equations also led to the theoretical discovery of "closed timelike curves" by mathematician Kurt Gödel in 1949, which suggest that closed loops in spacetime might allow time travel into the past. However, the presence of such curves is highly debated and their existence would necessitate cosmic conditions far beyond our comprehension and current technology to access.

More recent theories, such as those involving wormholes or black holes, have also been proposed as potential gateways to time travel. It is theorized that if one could stabilize a wormhole and adjust its ends within spacetime, one might facilitate travel into the past or future. In the case of black holes, their immense gravity can create an effect called "gravitational time dilation," in which time moves slower the closer you get to a black hole. In theory, it might be possible to orbit a black hole close enough that time dilation occurs, allowing the traveler to move into the future. However, these theories have not been experimentally verified, and it is uncertain whether it would ever be possible to implement or control these phenomena in practice.

Addressing the second part of your question: The two questions "Is backward time travel possible?" and "What is the possibility of time travel becoming a reality?" are similar but not equivalent. The first question specifically refers to the feasibility of backward time travel, while the second question is broader and encompasses both the feasibility and development of time travel as a whole, including travel to the future. It is important to note that our current understanding of physics does not prohibit the possibility of time travel completely, but backward time travel, especially, is laden with numerous challenges that we have not found a way to overcome.

With our current level of technology and understanding of the universe, it is impossible to predict with certainty whether time travel will ever become obtainable. Scientists are continually exploring the intricacies of spacetime, and future discoveries might shed new light on the subject.

Based on the context provided, the answer would be (a). No - the two questions do not have the exact same meaning.
