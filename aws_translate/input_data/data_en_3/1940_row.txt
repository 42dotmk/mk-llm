[Question]Kyle bikes for 2 hours to work every day. Ten times the time he takes to travel to work and back is the same as the cost of buying a pack of snacks (in dollars). How much will Ryan pay, in dollars, to buy 50 packs of snacks?
[Answer]A round trip to work and back takes 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Ten times the time Kyle takes to travel to work and back is the same as the cost of buying a pack of snacks, meaning the packs are sold at 4 * 10 = $40 each. Ryan will pay $40 * 50 = $2000 to buy 50 packs of snacks?. The answer is 2000.
Q: Annie has 6 barrettes, twice as many scrunchies as barrettes, and three fewer bobby pins than barrettes. What percentage of her hair decorations are bobby pins, rounded to the nearest percent?
A: First find the total number of scrunchies: 6 barrettes * 2 = 12 scrunchies. Then subtract three fewer bobby pins than barrettes 6 - 3 = 3 bobby pins. Then add the number of each type of hair decorations to find the total number: 6 decorations + 12 decorations + 3 decorations = 21 decorations. Then divide the number of bobby pins by the total number of decorations and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 3 bobby pins / 21 decorations * 100% = 14.28 which rounds down to 14%. The answer is 14.
Question: Deborah has four letters to mail. Standard postage is $1.08 per letter, with an additional charge for international mail. Deborah is mailing two letters internationally, and she is paying $4.60 to mail four letters. How many cents is the additional charge per letter for international shipping?
Answer: A dollar is 100 cents, so standard postage is 108 cents. Deborahâ€™s four letters cost 108 * 4 = 432 cents for standard postage. She paid 460 - 432 = 28 cents for international shipping on two letters. Thus, the additional international shipping charge is 28 / 2 = 14 cents per letter. The answer is 14.
[Question]The town is having a race to see who can run around the town square 7 times the fastest. The town square is 3/4 of a mile long. The winner finishes the race in 42 minutes. Last year's winner finished in 47.25 minutes. How many minutes on average faster did this year's winner run one mile of the race compared to last year?
[Answer]The race is 5.25 miles long because 7 x .75 = 5.25. They ran a mile in 8 minutes because 42 / 5.25 = 8. Last year's winner ran a mile in 9 minutes because 47.25 / 5.25 = 9. They ran 1 minute faster per mile compared to last year's winner. The answer is 1.
