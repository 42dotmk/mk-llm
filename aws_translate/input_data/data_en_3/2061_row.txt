In the period between 2009 and 2011, a series of meetings of the European Commission's horizontal working group took place, which focused on all types of plants.

During this period, the relevant working group of the European Commission held numerous sessions to address and discuss various aspects related to the different types of plants. The primary objective of these meetings was to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the botanical world and promote coordination among European Union members in terms of plant-related policies, research, and innovation.

Throughout the course of these meetings, several topics were discussed, including plant classification, cultivation techniques, environmental sustainability, and the economic and social implications of different plant species. Additionally, the working group also took into consideration the challenges posed by climate change and the increasing global population in regard to food security, as well as the importance of preserving biodiversity and natural habitats.

During the meetings, experts from various fields and representatives of different European Union member states had the opportunity to share their knowledge and insights, which led to a more cohesive and collaborative approach towards plant-related issues within the European Union. The outcomes of the discussions were documented, and the resulting knowledge was used to shape future policies, strategies, and initiatives in the area of plant research and development.

Some of the key areas of focus during these meetings included:

1. Plant classification and taxonomy: Understanding the diversity of plant species and their classification was essential for designing effective policies and strategies for their conservation and sustainable use.

2. Plant breeding and cultivation techniques: Advancements in breeding techniques and cultivation practices were discussed to enhance plant productivity, disease resistance, and adaptability to various environmental conditions.

3. Environmental sustainability: The working group emphasized the importance of adopting environmentally friendly and sustainable practices while managing agricultural lands and cultivating different plant species.

4. Economic and social aspects: The role of plants in economic development, promotion of employment, and improvement of living standards was also addressed during these sessions. It was acknowledged that effective management of plant resources can contribute to better economic outcomes for individuals and communities.

5. Adaptation to climate change and global challenges: The working group discussed the effects of climate change on plant species and the importance of developing strategies to preserve plant biodiversity and ensure food security in the face of global environmental challenges.

The meetings of the European Commission's horizontal working group on plants between 2009 and 2011 resulted in a better understanding of plant-related issues and led to the development of improved policies, strategies, and initiatives within the European Union. This collaborative approach has helped promote sustainable use, preservation, and development of plant resources throughout the region.
