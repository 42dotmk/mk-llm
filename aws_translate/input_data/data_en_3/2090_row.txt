Reasoning and answer: At the store, 5 / 8 of shoppers prefer to avoid the check - out line, a total of 5 / 8 * 480 = 300. The total number of shoppers at the store is 480; those who prefer the check - out line is 480 - 300 = 180.
The answer: 180

Climbing the full ladder means Darry has climbed 11 steps * 10 times = 110 steps so far. On his smaller ladder, he has climbed 6 steps * 7 times = 42 steps. So he has climbed a step a total of 110 + 42 = 152 times today.
The answer: 152
Reverse engineering the question: Darry is a roofer and has to climb ladders multiple times a day. He climbs his full ladder, which has 11 steps, 10 times today. He also climbs his smaller ladder, which has 6 steps, 7 times today. He did not climb any steps otherwise. In total, how many times has Darry climbed a step today?

Reasoning and answer: The show runs from 2:00 pm to 2:30 pm so that is 30 minutes. From Monday to Thursday, he watched a total of 30 * 4 = 120 minutes. In hours, this is equal to 120 / 60 = 2 hours.
The answer: 2

Every 2 ounces of butter is enough to cover 1 cup of baking mix, so the chef's remaining 4 ounces of butter will be enough to cover 4 / 2 = 2 cups of baking mix. This leaves 6 - 2 = 4 cups of baking mix that will require the use of coconut oil as a substitute. Since each cup of baking mix requires 2 ounces of coconut oil, these 4 cups will require a total of 4 * 2 = 8 ounces of coconut oil.
The answer: 8
Reverse engineering the question: A pastry chef is making brownies but is running out of butter. The recipe he is following calls for 2 ounces of butter for every 1 cup of baking mix; however, it allows 2 ounces of coconut oil to be substituted for the 2 ounces of butter if necessary. The chef would like to use as much butter as possible before switching over and substituting coconut oil. If the chef had 4 ounces of butter remaining, and he plans on using 6 cups of baking mix, how many ounces of coconut oil will he end up using?

Reasoning and answer: James is 37 - 15 = 22 years old. So 8 years ago he was 22 - 8 = 14 years old. That means Janet was 14 / 2 = 7 years old 8 years ago. So Janet is now 7 + 8 = 15 years old. That means Susan is 15 - 3 = 12 years old. So in 5 years she will be 12 + 5 = 17 years old.
The answer: 17

Reasoning and answer: His first drive was 30 * .5 = 15 miles. The next leg was .5 * 2 = 1 hour. The speed of the trip was 30 * 2 = 60 mph. So he drove 60 * 1 = 60 miles. So in total he drove 60 + 15 = 75 miles.
The answer: 75
