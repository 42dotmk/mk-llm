To bake a pumpkin, follow these detailed steps:

1. Gather your tools and ingredients:

Tools:
- A sharp knife
- A cutting board
- A spoon for scooping out seeds and pulp
- A baking sheet or roasting pan
- Aluminum foil or parchment paper for lining (optional)
- Oven mitts
- A fork to test for doneness

Ingredients:
- One whole pumpkin (choose a baking pumpkin, such as a sugar pumpkin or pie pumpkin, not the large carving pumpkins)
- Vegetable oil or melted butter for brushing (optional)
- Salt and pepper to taste (optional)
- Additional spices, herbs, or sweeteners as desired (such as cinnamon, nutmeg, rosemary, or brown sugar)

2. Preheat your oven:
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This is a suitable temperature for baking a pumpkin. 

3. Prepare the pumpkin:
First, wash the pumpkin thoroughly to remove any dirt. On a stable cutting board, carefully cut off the stem of the pumpkin with a sharp knife. Then, cut the pumpkin in half, from top to bottom. Use a spoon to scoop out the seeds and stringy pulp from the pumpkin's interior. You can save the seeds for roasting later if you wish.

4. Season the pumpkin (optional):
If you'd like to add some flavor to your baked pumpkin, you can brush the cut side of the pumpkin with a thin layer of vegetable oil or melted butter. Then, sprinkle a dash each of salt and pepper, or any desired spices and herbs, onto the oiled surfaces. You can also drizzle the pumpkin with a sweetener like maple syrup or honey for added sweetness.

5. Arrange the pumpkin on a baking sheet:
Line a baking sheet or roasting pan with aluminum foil or parchment paper if you'd like to make clean-up easier. Place the pumpkin halves, cut-side-down, onto the prepared baking sheet. This will help the pumpkin cook evenly and prevent it from drying out.

6. Bake the pumpkin:
Place the baking sheet with the pumpkin halves into the preheated oven. Bake for approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the pumpkin's flesh is tender when pierced with a fork. The baking time may vary depending on the size and thickness of the pumpkin, so keep an eye on it and adjust the time as necessary.

7. Remove the pumpkin from the oven:
Wearing oven mitts, carefully remove the baking sheet from the oven. Allow the pumpkin halves to cool for a few minutes on the baking sheet, then flip them over to fully cool. You may choose to serve the baked pumpkin as a side dish or continue by using the cooked flesh in other recipes, like pumpkin puree, soups, or pies.

8. Scoop out the baked pumpkin flesh:
Once the pumpkin has cooled enough to handle, use a spoon to scoop out the tender flesh from the skin. You can discard the skin or save it for another purpose, like composting.

9. Use or store the baked pumpkin:
You can now use the baked pumpkin in a variety of recipes, such as pumpkin pie, pumpkin soup, pumpkin ravioli, or pumpkin bread. If you don't plan to use the pumpkin right away, you can store the cooked, cooled flesh in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or freeze it for longer-term storage.

With these detailed steps, you'll be on your way to baking a delicious, tender pumpkin that can be used in various dishes or enjoyed as a simple, seasonal side dish. Happy baking!
