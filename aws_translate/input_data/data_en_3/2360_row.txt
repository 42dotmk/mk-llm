Reasoning and answer: The actual initial inventory of Samsung cell phones was 14, but there were 2 defective phones so 14 - 2 = 12 is the initial inventory of working Samsung phones. The actual initial inventory of iPhone cell phones was 8, but there was one defective phone, so 8 - 1 = 7 is the actual initial inventory of working iPhones. Thus only 12 - 10 = 2 Samsung cell phones were sold. Thus only 7 - 5 = 2 iPhones were sold. Thus the total number of phones sold is 2 Samsung + 2 iPhone = 4 cell phones.
The answer: 4

If a cab ride costs $2.5 per mile, and Briar has to go to an event 200 miles away, he will spend 200 * $2.5 = $500 one way to the trip. Since the round trip is also 200 miles and Briar is charged $500, the total amount he spends in a day to go to the event and back is $500 + $500 = $1000. The event is one week, meaning Briar will have to spend $1000 * 7 = $7000 on the cab rides.
The answer: 7000
