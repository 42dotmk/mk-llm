Q: Hooper Bay has twice as many pounds of lobster than the two other harbors combined. If the other two harbors have 80 pounds of lobster each, how many pounds of lobster are the three harbors holding?
A: Since the other two harbors have 80 pounds of lobsters each, they have a total of 80 + 80 = 160 pounds of lobster. Since Hooper Bay has two times more lobsters than the other two harbors combined, it has 2 * 160 = 320 pounds of lobster. In total, the three harbors have 320 + 160 = 480 pounds of lobster. The answer is 480.
Question: Hannah wants to save $80 for five weeks. In the first week, she saved $4 and she plans to save twice as much as her savings as the previous week. How much will she save in the fifth week to reach her goal?
Answer: In the second week, Hannah will save $4 x 2 = $8. In the third week, she will save $8 x 2 = $16. In the fourth week, she will save $16 x 2 = $32. Her total savings for a month will be $4 + $8 + $16 + $32 = $60. Hannah needs to save $80 - $60 = $20 in the fifth week. The answer is 20.
[Question]Matilda had 20 chocolate bars and shared them evenly amongst herself and her 4 sisters. When her father got home from work, he was upset that they did not put aside any chocolates for him. They felt bad, so they each gave up half of their chocolate bars for their father. Their father then gave 3 chocolate bars to their mother and ate 2. How many chocolate bars did Matilda's father have left?
[Answer]Matilda and her sisters each got 20 chocolate bars / 5 people = 4 chocolate bars / person. They each gave 4 / person / 2 = 2 chocolate bars / person to their father. Their father received 2 chocolate bars / person x 5 people = 10 chocolate bars. Their father had 10 chocolate bars - 3 chocolate bars - 2 chocolate bars = 5 chocolate bars left. The answer is 5.
Q: A candy store sold 20 pounds of fudge for $2.50/pound, 5 dozen chocolate truffles for $1.50 each and 3 dozen chocolate-covered pretzels at $2.00 each. How much money did the candy store make?
A: 20 pounds of fudge at $2.50 / pounds is 20 * 2.50 = $50.00. The 5 dozen truffles were sold in individual units so a dozen is equal to 12 so 5 * 12 = 60. 60 chocolate truffles, at $1.50 each sold for 60 * 1.50 = $90.00. The 3 dozen chocolate pretzels sold in individual units so a dozen is equal to 12 so 3 * 12 = 36. 36 chocolate pretzels sold for $2.00 each sold for 36 * 2 = $72.00. All total, the store made 50 + 90 + 72 = $212.00 from candy sales. The answer is 212.
Question: Jack needs to put his shoes on, then help both his toddlers tie their shoes. If it takes Jack 4 minutes to put his shoes on, and three minutes longer to help each toddler with their shoes, how long does it take them to get ready?
Answer: First figure out how long it takes to help one toddler: 4 minutes + 3 minutes = 7 minutes. Then multiply the time per toddler by the number of toddlers: 7 minutes / toddler * 2 toddlers = 14 minutes. Now add the time spent helping the toddlers to the time Jack spends on his own shoes: 14 minutes + 4 minutes = 18 minutes. The answer is 18.
