The sentence, "An interpleader starts with a video," does not follow the preceding text.

Instead, the following information could be helpful in elaborating on the process of filing an interpleader as provided in the initial text:

Filing an interpleader typically involves the following steps:

1. Conduct Legal Research: Before initiating an interpleader action, it is essential to research the relevant statutes, rules, and case law that govern interpleader actions in your jurisdiction. Understanding the applicable laws will help you draft your complaint and ensure that you meet all legal requirements.

2. Prepare the Complaint: Draft a complaint, which is the initial document filed in an interpleader action, indicating that you seek the court's assistance in resolving a dispute among claimants to certain property or funds. Describe the parties, the overarching issue, and the conflicting claims that prompted the interpleader action. The complaint should also include statements about the jurisdiction and venue of the court, a request for service upon the defendants, and a prayer for relief, asking the court to compel the parties to interplead.

3. Attach Required Documentation: Depending on your jurisdiction, you may be required to attach specific documents to the complaint, such as a sworn affidavit or a copy of the disputed property or funds. Consult the local rules and procedures to ensure compliance with these requirements.

4. Pay the Filing Fee: File your complaint and other required documents with the appropriate court, along with the required filing fee. The fees vary by jurisdiction, so contact the court clerk's office to determine the amount.

5. Serve the Defendants: After filing the complaint, you must serve copies of the complaint and any other required documents on each defendant. Service of process rules vary by jurisdiction, so consult the local rules to determine the acceptable methods, such as service by mail or personal service by a sheriff or process server.

6. Await Response from Defendants: Once service is complete, the defendants have a specified amount of time, usually 20-30 days, to respond to the complaint by either filing an answer, in which they admit or deny the allegations and present any defenses, or by filing a dispositive motion, such as a motion to dismiss.

7. Participate in Court Proceedings: If the case proceeds, the parties will engage in the discovery process to exchange information and evidence. The court may schedule hearings, conferences, or settlement negotiations, which you must attend and participate in as required.

8. Attend Trial, If Necessary: If the parties cannot reach a settlement agreement, the case may proceed to trial. At the trial, you will present evidence and arguments to persuade the court to resolve the dispute in your favor.

9. Comply with the Court's Judgment: After the court issues its judgment, you must comply with the terms. This may include distributing any disputed property or funds to the determined rightful claimant(s) and paying any associated costs or fees.

In conclusion, an interpleader does not begin with a video, as mentioned earlier, but rather with a complaint and subsequent steps to initiate a legal action.
