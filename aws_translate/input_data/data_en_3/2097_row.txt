Question: Louis is making himself a velvet suit for a formal event. The velvet fabric he chose was $24 per yard. He bought a pattern for $15, and two spools of silver thread for $3 each. If he spent $141 for the pattern, thread, and fabric, how many yards of fabric did he buy?
Answer: Let V be the number of yards of velvet fabric Louis bought. The silver thread cost 2 * 3 = $6. He spent 24V + 15 + 6 = $141 on the suit. The fabric cost 24V = 141 - 15 - 6 = $120. Thus, Louis bought V = 120 / 24 = 5 yards of fabric. The answer is 5.
[Question]John had $20. He spent 1/5 of his money on snacks and 3/4 of the remaining money on necessities. How much is left of John's money?
[Answer]John spent $20 x 1 / 5 = $4 on snacks. He had $20 - $4 = $16 remaining. He spent $16 x 3 / 4 = $12 on his necessities. So, John is left with $16 - $12 = $4. The answer is 4.
Q: There are four times as many boys at Lulu's party as girls. Each boy paid twice the money that each girl paid to attend the party. If there are 40 boys at the party and each boy paid $50 to attend the party, calculate the total amount of money collected at the party.
A: The total amount of money collected from the boy's payment is 40 * $50 = $2000. There are four times as many boys at Lulu's party as girls, meaning there are 40 / 4 = 10 girls at the party. since each boy paid twice the money that each girl paid to attend the party, each girl paid $50 / 2 = $25. The total amount of money collected from the girl's payment is $25 * 10 = $250. The total amount of money collected at the party is $250 + $2000 = $2250. The answer is 2250.
Question: A married couple opened a savings account. The wife committed to saving $100 every week while the husband committed to saving $225 every month. After 4 months of savings, they decided to invest half of their money in buying stocks. Each share of stocks costs $50. How many shares of stocks can they buy?
Answer: The wife saves $100 / week x 4 weeks / month = $400 a month. Together, the wife and husband save $400 / month + $225 / month = $625 / month. In 4 months, their total savings is $625 / month x 4 months = $2500. They are going to invest $2500 / 2 = $1250. So, they can buy $1250 / $50 / share = 25 shares of stocks. The answer is 25.
[Question]Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
[Answer]Alice folds 1000 * 0.5 = 500 paper cranes by herself. This leaves 1000 – 500 = 500 paper cranes left to fold. A friend folds a fifth of the remaining amount, so they have folded 500 / 5 = 100 paper cranes for her. This means there is a total of 1000 – 500 – 100 = 400 paper cranes left for Alice to fold. The answer is 400.
