- Haitian contingent landed back on home soil, the crisis escalated and both governments became involved.

The Haitian under-17 team, feeling humiliated and disappointed by their withdrawal from the qualifying tournament, was warmly welcomed by their nation upon their return. The emotional reaction back in Haiti fueled the ongoing tension between the two neighboring countries as people rightfully questioned the decisions made by Jamaica.

In an attempt to reduce the mounting strain on diplomatic channels, a series of meetings were arranged between top officials from both Haiti and Jamaica. These meetings were aimed at discussing the issue and finding solutions to prevent such unfortunate events from occurring in the future.

After several intense discussions, the officials agreed on implementing a series of measures to prevent such situations from arising in the future. Firstly, the establishment of a joint Haitian-Jamaican soccer committee would focus on improving cooperation and communication between the two nations when it comes to organizing and conducting soccer tournaments and events.

Secondly, both governments decided that strengthening cultural ties between the two countries would help in reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings and promoting a more collaborative and friendly atmosphere during competitions. This would be achieved through cultural exchange programs and events, bringing people from both nations together in an effort to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation for each other's cultures and backgrounds.

Lastly, Jamaica agreed to compensate the Haitian soccer team for their financial losses incurred due to their forced withdrawal from the qualifying tournament. Acknowledging their part in the unfortunate events, Jamaica also expressed its support for Haiti's soccer development by offering resources and training opportunities to Haitian teams.

As time passed, the implemented measures began showing positive results. The joint Haitian-Jamaican soccer committee started functioning smoothly, and various recommendations were made to enhance match regulations and improve the overall soccer experience for players, officials, and spectators alike.

The cultural exchange programs and events successfully bridged the gap between residents of both countries and nurtured an environment of friendship and mutual respect. This eventually led to a reduction in tension between the two governments and created a more collaborative atmosphere in different areas, including sports.

A few years later, as another hurricane season approached the Caribbean, Haiti and Jamaica stood together in unity and partnership, weathering the storms, both literal and metaphorical, and proving the power of collaboration and understanding in overcoming even the most trivial of differences.

In the end, both countries were able to turn a volatile and unfortunate situation into a learning experience and an opportunity to strengthen friendship, cooperation, and solidarity. The lasting positive effects of these efforts, both on and off the soccer field, continued to flourish and serve as a shining example of how sports can transcend borders and unite nations in a common cause.
