[Question]Cary starts working at Game Stop for $10/hour. She gets a 20% raise the first year, but the second year the company's profits decrease and her pay is cut to 75% of what it used to be. How much does Cary make now?
[Answer]First find the amount of Cary's raise by multiplying $10 by 20%: $10 * .2 = $2. Then add Cary's raise to her initial wage to find her wage after one year: $10 + $2 = $12. Then multiply that wage by 75% to find Cary's wage after her pay cut: $12 * .75 = $9. The answer is 9.
Q: Sofia went to the department store to buy a pair of shoes and 2 shirts. A shirt costs $7 while a pair of shoes is $3 more than the shirt. If she decides to buy a bag which costs half the total price of the 2 shirts and a pair of shoes, how much will she pay for all those items?
A: Two shirts costs $7 x 2 = $14. The cost of a pair of shoes is $7 + $3 = $10. The total cost of two shirts a pair of shoes is $14 + $10 = $24. The cost of a bag is $24 / 2 = $12. So, Sofia paid a total of $14 + $10 + $12 = $36. The answer is 36.
Question: Ben will receive a bonus of $1496. He chooses to allocate this amount as follows: 1/22 for the kitchen, 1/4 for holidays and 1/8 for Christmas gifts for his 3 children. How much money will he still have left after these expenses?
Answer: Ben's spending for the kitchen is $1496 x 1 / 22 = $68. Ben's spending for holidays is $1496 x 1 / 4 = $374. Ben's spending for children's gifts is $1496 x 1 / 8 = $187. The total amount spent is $68 + $374 + $187 = $629. So, Ben still has $1496 - $629 = $867 left. The answer is 867.
[Question]Sarah interviewed 450 students at her school and asked them which fruit they liked best - oranges, apples, pears or strawberries. 70 students said they liked oranges, 120 students said they liked pears, and 147 students said they liked apples. How many students picked strawberries as their favorite fruit from the list?
[Answer]First, you have to add the number of students that liked the three other fruits. Therefore, you have to add 70 + 120 + 147. This gives you a sum of 337. We know that 450 students were interviewed, so you have to subtract 337 from 450 to get the number of students who liked strawberries. 450 - 337 = 113 students liked strawberries best out of all of the fruits. The answer is 113.
Q: Jill likes to do small jobs online. She makes $10 a day for her first month working online, and double that per day in her second month. Her third month she makes the same amount per day as the previous month, but only works every other day. How much did she make over three months, assuming each month is 30 days long?
A: Since there are 30 days in a month and Jill makes $10 a day her first month, she makes 30 * 10 = 300 dollars her first month. She makes twice the amount of the previous month's $300 in her second month, so she makes 2 * 300 = 600 dollars her second month. She makes the same amount per day the third month, but only works half the number of days, so she makes 600 / 2 = 300 dollars a month her third month. In total, she makes 300 + 300 + 600 = 1,200 dollars. The answer is 1200.
