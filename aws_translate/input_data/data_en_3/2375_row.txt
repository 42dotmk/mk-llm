Steven handed over the written exam to Adam, because Adam wanted to grade the driving test. Adam, a veteran driving instructor and examiner, had recently taken over the responsibilities of overseeing the driving tests at the local testing center. He was keenly aware of the importance of both the written and practical aspects of the exam, as they were essential in ensuring that new drivers were proficient and safe on the roads.

Taking the written exam from Steven with a warm smile and a nod, Adam walked back to his office, excited about the opportunity to help a new batch of aspiring drivers. He believed that by personally grading the exams, he would develop a better understanding of the students' grasp on traffic rules and defensive driving measures, which would enable him to give valuable feedback and guide them towards improvement.

As Adam settled into his comfortable swivel chair, he began reviewing the first question, which focused on the right-of-way rules at a four-way stop. He appreciated the fact that the test covered a range of relevant topics, such as road signs, speed limits, alcohol and drug-impaired driving, and parking regulations. This comprehensive approach, he believed, was a crucial factor in creating well-rounded, responsible drivers who were confident behind the wheel.

Adam mentally applauded Steven's commitment toward providing students with the necessary tools and resources to excel in their driving test. He knew that Steven had gone the extra mile in gathering the most up-to-date information on driving practices, incorporating it into the learning materials, and meticulously preparing the written exam.

As he continued grading the exams, Adam was impressed by the students' overall knowledge and their ability to apply critical thinking when faced with challenging questions that required them to draw on their understanding of various driving scenarios. At the same time, Adam took note of the areas where improvement was needed, such as merging onto a highway, the use of turn signals, and the importance of maintaining a safe following distance.

Adam also appreciated the variety of questions in the written exam, ranging from multiple-choice to short answer, and even a few diagram-based questions. This mix allowed him to gauge students' understanding from different angles, ensuring that they possessed a well-rounded grasp of the course material.

Once he had finished grading all of the written exams, Adam carefully tallied the scores and recorded them in the database. He then began preparing detailed feedback and recommendations for each student, ensuring they would have a clear understanding of where they had excelled and what areas they needed to focus on.

With the written exams completed, Adam refocused his attention on the practical driving tests. He knew that the process of becoming a skilled driver was an ongoing journey, and it was crucial to recognize and cultivate students' strengths while addressing their weaknesses. Working alongside Steven, Adam was determined to uphold the highest standards of driver education and ensure that the driving test process was both rigorous and effective, ultimately contributing to the safety and well-being of all road users.
