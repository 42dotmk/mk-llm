Human gestation is commonly divided into three trimesters. 

Each trimester represents a distinct period of development and growth for both the mother and the developing fetus. The duration of a human pregnancy is approximately 40 weeks, with each trimester lasting roughly 13 to 14 weeks. Understanding the different stages of pregnancy can help provide a better understanding of the physical and emotional changes experienced during this period.

1. First trimester (week 1 to week 12-13): 

The first trimester is critical for the initial development of the baby. It starts with fertilization when the sperm meets the egg, and this fertilized egg implants itself into the lining of the uterus. At this stage, the baby is called an embryo, and its development begins with the formation of essential body systems, including the nervous system, heart, and lungs.

During this trimester, pregnancy-related hormones such as hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin), progesterone, and estrogen increase. The surge in these hormones can cause common early pregnancy symptoms like morning sickness, fatigue, breast tenderness, and frequent urination. As the first trimester comes to an end, the risk of miscarriage decreases significantly.

2. Second trimester (week 13 to week 26-27):

The second trimester is known as the "golden period" of pregnancy because many uncomfortable symptoms from the first trimester begin to subside, and the risk of miscarriage is lower. At this stage, the fetus transitions from being an embryo to a fetus. The organs and body systems continue to mature and develop, leading to the fetus's rapid growth.

During this period, the mother begins to show a more visible baby bump as her uterus expands to accommodate the baby's growth. The mother may also start to experience fetal movements or "quickening" during the second trimester. Additionally, new symptoms like round ligament pain and lower back pain may occur as the body adjusts to the changes in weight and posture.

3. Third trimester (week 27 to week 40):

The third trimester is the final stage of pregnancy, and the fetus's organs continue to mature and function independently. The fetus gains weight rapidly as layers of fat begin to form, which is essential for maintaining body temperature after birth. The lungs develop further to prepare for breathing outside the womb, and the brain continues to grow.

During this period, the mother might experience increased discomfort due to the size of the baby and the pressure it puts on her internal organs. Common symptoms in the third trimester include shortness of breath, heartburn, swelling, and difficulty sleeping. The body also starts preparing for labor by releasing a hormone called relaxin, which softens the ligaments and joints in the pelvic region. Toward the end of this trimester, the baby typically shifts into the head-down position to prepare for birth.

In summary, human gestation is divided into three trimesters, each with its unique set of developmental milestones and changes for both the mother and the fetus. Understanding each stage can help expectant parents prepare for the physical, emotional, and psychological needs associated with the pregnancy journey.
