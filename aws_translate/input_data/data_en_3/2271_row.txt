The sentence provided, "Its distinctive feature, exemplified in the founding example of modern federalism of the United States of America under the Constitution of 1789, is a relationship of parity between the two levels of government established," does not explicitly answer the question "Federalism combines what two types of government?" However, it does suggest the presence of two levels of government that are involved in the concept of federalism and mentions that these two levels operate in a relationship of parity. This indicates that federalism involves cooperation between these two levels of government, each having their own powers and responsibilities.

To answer the question explicitly, we can discuss the concept of federalism and determine the two types of government that it combines. Federalism is a political system in which authority and powers are divided between a centralized government and individual, smaller political units such as states, provinces, or territories. These two levels of government are the central (also known as the federal or national) government and the constituent (also known as regional, state, or provincial) government. Federalism strikes a balance between the two and creates a system that enables them to work together to govern a nation.

In a federal system, the central government is responsible for the matters that concern the entire nation and require the coordination and uniformity that only it can provide. These responsibilities usually include foreign policy, national defense, the economy, the establishment of national laws, and other broader issues that affect the entire country. In contrast, the constituent governments have authority over matters that are more local in nature and pertain to the needs and interests of the specific communities or regions they cover (e.g., education, local infrastructure, public health, and law enforcement). The specific division of powers varies depending on the constitutional structure of the country, but the federal system is designed to ensure that no single level of government is given absolute authority over all aspects of governance.

In the context of the United States, which was mentioned in the initial sentence, the Constitution of 1789 established the foundational principles of federalism by defining the division of powers between the Federal government and the state governments. This federalism structure has evolved over time, with different interpretations and changes in the specific allocation of responsibilities, but the core concept of the relationship between the two levels of government remains essential to the American political system.

To summarize, the sentence provided implies the presence of two levels of government that are involved in federalism. To answer the question explicitly, federalism combines two types of governments: the central (national or federal) government and the constituent (regional, state, or provincial) government. These two levels of government operate in a relationship of parity and share responsibility for governing a nation based on a division of powers that allows them to address different scopes of issues, from national concerns to more localized matters.
