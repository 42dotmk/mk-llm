The first step missing in this process is "inhaling air through the nostrils or mouth." 

To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the process, let's start with the missing first step and then proceed through the rest of the steps in detail:

1. Inhaling air through the nostrils or mouth: The process of respiration begins when an individual breathes in air through their nostrils or their mouth. The nostrils are lined with hair and mucus, acting as natural filters that capture dust, allergens, and pathogens, preventing them from entering the respiratory system. The air is also warmed and humidified as it passes through the nasal cavity.

2. Air travels down the trachea: After the air is inhaled through the nostrils or mouth, it travels down the trachea, also known as the windpipe. The trachea is a tube-like structure that is surrounded by cartilage rings that provide it with support and flexibility. 

3. Air enters bronchial tubes: The trachea branches into two bronchial tubes, which transport the air into the lungs. Each bronchial tube is lined with cilia and mucus to help filter the air and prevent any harmful particles from entering the lungs.

4. Air is then split into the bronchioles of each lung: Within the lungs, the bronchial tubes further branch into smaller structures called bronchioles, which divide and narrow progressively, forming an extensive network throughout the lung tissue.

5. Bronchioles have alveoli which are tiny air sacs: At the end of the bronchioles, there are tiny air sacs called alveoli. The walls of the alveoli are very thin, and their primary function is to facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

6. Alveoli are surrounded by many small blood vessels (capillaries): The alveoli have a rich supply of blood, allowing for a thorough exchange of gases between the alveoli and the blood vessels.

7. Oxygen passes through the alveoli into blood vessels: As oxygen from the inhaled air enters the alveoli, it diffuses through the alveolar walls and into the surrounding capillaries. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide in the blood diffuses from the capillaries into the alveoli.

8. Blood leaves the lungs as it travels through the body: The oxygen-rich blood leaves the lungs through the pulmonary veins and is pumped by the heart throughout the body. The blood delivers the oxygen to the body's cells and tissues, where it is used for cellular respiration and various metabolic processes.

9. Blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs: After the oxygen has been utilized by the body's cells, waste, in the form of carbon dioxide, is produced. The blood then carries this carbon dioxide waste back to the lungs through the pulmonary arteries and into the capillaries surrounding the alveoli.

10. Carbon dioxide is released when you exhale: Finally, the carbon dioxide that has been transported back to the lungs is expelled from the body during exhalation. As the muscle diaphragm relaxes, it pushes air out of the lungs, allowing the carbon dioxide to exit through the nostrils or mouth.

This entire process constitutes the respiratory cycle, which is essential for providing the body with the necessary oxygen and removing waste products in the form of carbon dioxide.
