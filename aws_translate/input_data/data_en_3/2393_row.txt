Yes, both Question 1 and Question 2 are essentially asking about the reasons behind the taboo status of sex in India despite its cultural heritage and contribution to the world in the form of the Kamasutra. However, Question 2 specifically points out the seeming irony of India being known for the Kamasutra and yet still having a strong taboo regarding sex. Here's a detailed answer to both questions:

The taboo around sex in India has its roots embedded in various cultural, historical, and social aspects that have evolved over time. Here are some key reasons behind this taboo:

1. Influence of religious beliefs: India, being a multicultural society, has numerous religions coexisting, such as Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Jainism, and others. Most of these religions emphasize modesty, purity, and the importance of marital relationships for sexual activities. This may have given rise to conservative attitudes towards sex.

2. The impact of colonialism: During the colonial era, particularly under British rule, Western Victorian values and moral code significantly influenced Indian society. This led to the suppression of India's liberal outlook towards sexuality, which was then regarded as a deviation from the 'civilized' norm. Kamasutra, an ancient text on human sexuality, which was well-accepted in ancient India, became a symbol of embarrassment for many during this period.

3. Social hierarchy and gender roles: Like many other societies, India has a strongly defined social hierarchy and traditional gender roles. These structures encourage the idea of women as social symbols of modesty and piety, leading to the suppression of their sexual desires. Any deviation from gender norms tends to be frowned upon.

4. Lack of sex education: In India, formal sex education is not a compulsory part of the school curriculum. Thus, young people often receive limited and misleading information about sex and sexuality from friends, films, or other unreliable sources. This contributes to misguided perceptions and the perpetuation of myths and misconceptions about sex.

5. Stigma around open conversations: The taboo status of sex in India means that any open conversation about sex is often considered inappropriate or offensive. This prevents people from discussing their concerns, problems, or doubts related to sex and sexual health, leading to a lack of awareness and understanding.

6. Media portrayal of sex: Indian media and entertainment industry, such as cinema and television, tend to portray sex and sexuality in an exaggerated, sensationalized, or distorted manner. This further contributes to misunderstanding and stereotypes related to sex.

Despite the rich cultural heritage of ancient India, which includes the Kamasutra and the famous erotic sculptures at temples like Khajuraho, the current taboo is deeply entrenched in the countryâ€™s psyche. This is due to evolved historical, religious, social, and cultural changes that shaped India's attitude towards sex over time. Efforts to address this taboo can include promoting open and healthy discussions, introducing comprehensive sex education, and challenging regressive stereotypes that restrict individuals' understanding and acceptance of their own sexuality.
