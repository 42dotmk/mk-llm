Reasoning and answer: 480 x 10 / 100 = 48 employees got a salary increase. 480 x 20 / 100 = 96 employees got a travel allowance increase. So a total of 48 + 96 = 144 employees got an increase. Therefore, 480 - 144 = 336 employees did not get any increase.
The answer: 336

Reasoning and answer: Rachel spends 1 + 1 = 2 hours setting up and cleaning up. She paints for 1 hour x 4 paintings = 4 hours. Then she edits 1.5 hours x 4 videos = 6 hours. She spends 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 hours to make 4 videos. So Rachel spends 12 / 4 = 3 hours on each video.
The answer: 3

In the first month, the song will have 60,000 * 2 = 120,000 listens. In the second month, the song will have 120000 * 2 = 240,000 listens. In the third month, the song will have 240000 * 2 = 480,000 listens. By the end of the year Jordan's song will have a total of 60,000 + 120,000 + 240,000 + 480,000 = 900,000 listens.

Reasoning and answer: First find the total cost of the shirt: $20 * 2 = $40. Then find the total cost of the tie: $40 / 5 = $8. Then find the cost of one uniform set: $20 + $40 + $8 + $3 = $71. Then multiply the cost of each set by the number of sets each student has to buy to find the total cost: $71 / set * 5 sets = $355.
The answer: 355

Reasoning and answer: Each pair of boxes weighs 40 pounds + 10 pounds, or 50 pounds. Each pair weighs 50 pounds, so the delivery trucks can carry 2000 / 50 pairs of boxes or 40 pairs. Steven has three trucks, so each trip can move 40 * 3 pairs of boxes = 120 pairs of boxes. Each pair is a set of two boxes, so each delivery contains 120 * 2 boxes = 240 boxes.
The answer: 240
