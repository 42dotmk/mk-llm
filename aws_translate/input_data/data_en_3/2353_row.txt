The middle class in the United States is a social and economic class comprised of individuals and households who fall between the working class and the upper class within the broader American social hierarchy. Defining the middle class is somewhat challenging, as opinions and concepts can be ambiguous in everyday language and popular opinion; however, contemporary social scientists have offered several congruent theories. In order to understand what constitutes the American middle class, it is essential to consider a range of factors including income, occupation, education, and social attributes.

1. Income: One of the most common ways of defining the middle class is through income levels. Many experts use household income as a key indicator: for instance, the Pew Research Center categorizes those with incomes between two-thirds and twice the national median income as "middle class." According to this definition, a household earning around $40,000 to $120,000 (adjusted for-cost-of-living) would be considered middle class in the United States.

2. Occupation: Occupational status is another crucial factor in defining the middle class. Those who work in white-collar jobs, such as managerial, professional, and technical roles, are often considered part of the middle class. These jobs typically require a higher level of education and training, provide greater income stability, and offer opportunities for upward mobility as compared to the blue-collar jobs traditionally associated with the working class.

3. Education: Education plays a significant role in shaping the American middle class. Those with a college degree or higher level of education are more likely to belong to the middle class based on their increased access to higher-paying jobs and opportunities for career advancement.

4. Social attributes: Social attributes, such as the ability to maintain a specific standard of living, the level of economic security, and the level of engagement in cultural and community activities, also contribute to defining the middle class. The middle class often enjoys a relatively stable and comfortable lifestyle, with access to resources like health care, quality education, and housing. Moreover, members of the middle class may actively participate in their communities through civic organizations, education-related functions, or cultural events.

5. Wealth and assets: Finally, the accumulation of wealth and assets is an important aspect of middle-class status. In addition to income, factors such as homeownership, retirement savings, and other forms of investments can play a role in differentiating the middle class from other social classes.

In conclusion, the middle class in the United States is a diverse and multifaceted social group shaped by various factors, such as income, occupation, education, social attributes, and accumulated wealth and assets. While there are differences among its individual members, they generally share a common socioeconomic status and lifestyle that sets them apart from the working class and upper class. Thus, understanding the middle class requires recognizing these various dimensions and their intersections, which create a complex web of social and economic relations.
