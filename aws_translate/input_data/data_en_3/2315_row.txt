Question: Lizzy's school choir has a mixture of 80 blonde and black-haired girls. Their teacher decides to add 10 more girls to the choir, who turns out to be blonde. If there were 30 blonde-haired girls in the choir initially, how many black-haired girls are present?

Lil Jon bought them a car worth $30000, and Wynter presented them with a house worth four times the value of the car Lil Jon bought them.

[Answer]Moksi took DJ Snake and his fiancee to a luxurious hotel for two nights at $4000 per night, for a total of 2 * $4000 = $8000. If Lil Jon also bought them a car worth $30000, the value of the treats from Lil John and Moksi summed up to $8000 + $30000 = $38000. Wynter presented them with a house worth four times the value of the car Lil Jon bought them, a total of 4 * $30000 = $120000. The total value of all the treats DJ Snake received on his engagement day is $120000 + $38000 = $158000. The answer is 158000.
