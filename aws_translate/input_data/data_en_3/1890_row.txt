Q: Jason drives past 3 convenience stores on his way to work. The distance between the first store and the second store is 6 miles. The distance between the second store and third store is 2/3rds longer than the distance between the first two stores. The distance from his house to the first store and the last store to work is the same, 4 miles. How long in miles is Jason's commute to work?
A: First find the additional distance between the second store and the third store: 6 miles * 2 / 3 = 4 miles. Then add that to the distance between the first two stores to find the total distance between the second and third stores: 4 miles + 6 miles = 10 miles. Then add the distance between the first two stores, the distance from Jason's house to the first store, and the distance from the last store to work: 10 miles + 6 miles + 4 miles + 4 miles = 24 miles. The answer is 24.
Question: Marcos has to get across a 5 mile lake in his speedboat in 10 minutes so he can make it to work on time. How fast does he need to go in miles per hour to make it?
Answer: 10 minutes for 5 miles means 10 minutes / 5 miles = 2 minutes / mile. 1 hour is 60 minutes so 60 minutes / hour / 2 minutes / mile = 30 miles / hour. The answer is 30.
[Question]The spacecraft Gibraltar is a mountain-sized intergalactic vehicle for transporting equipment, building materials, and families to establish colonies on far-away planets. At full capacity, the vehicle can carry 300 family units with four people per family. The space flight is expected to take years, and it is expected that the size of families will grow during the space voyage. Therefore, when the spacecraft leaves the earth, it will carry 100 people less than one-third of the ship's capacity. How many people will be on the ship to start the journey?
[Answer]The full capacity of the ship is 300 * 4 = 1200 people. One - third of capacity is 1200 / 3 = 400 people. 100 less than one - third capacity is 400 - 100 = 300 people. The answer is 300.
Q: Aria has twice as many high school credits as Emily, who has twice the number of high school credits as Spencer. If Emily has 20 credits, what's twice the total number of high school credits the three have?
A: If Emily has 20 credits, and Aria has 2 times as many, then Aria has 2 * 20 = 40 high school credits. Emily has twice the number of high school credits Spencer has, meaning Spencer has 20 / 2 = 10 high school credits. Altogether, the three have 40 + 20 + 10 = 70 high school credits. Twice the total number of high school credits the three have is 2 * 70 = 140. The answer is 140.
Question: Natalia is riding a bicycle for the cycling competition. On Monday she rode 40 kilometers and on Tuesday 50 kilometers. On Wednesday she rode 50% fewer kilometers than the day before. On Thursday she rode as many as the sum of the kilometers from Monday and Wednesday. How many kilometers did Natalie ride in total?
Answer: On Wednesday she covered half of the distance from Tuesday, so 50 / 2 = 25 kilometers. On Thursday she rode 40 + 25 = 65 kilometers. In total, Natalia rode 40 + 50 + 25 + 65 = 180 kilometers. The answer is 180.
