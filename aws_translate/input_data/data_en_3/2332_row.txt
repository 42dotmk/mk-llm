No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. They are related to different aspects of Infosys and pursuing higher education. Let me address each question separately:

1. Do we get an opportunity to do MS after Infosys training?

Infosys training typically refers to the training program provided by Infosys to its new recruits, commonly known as the Infosys Global Education Centre or Infosys Mysore training. Usually, employees undergo this comprehensive training program before being placed at one of the company's facilities to work on client projects.

Now, regarding the opportunity to pursue an MS (Master of Science) degree after this training, it is essential to understand that the purpose of the Infosys training is to train professionals for the IT industry, while an MS is an academic degree. They serve different objectives, but that doesn't mean you cannot pursue an MS after Infosys training.

If you are interested in a higher education degree, you have several options:

A. You can enroll in a part-time or online MS program during your employment with Infosys or any other organization. Many institutions offer these flexible study options that can be pursued alongside a full-time job.

B. You can choose to take a break from work and pursue a full-time MS program at a university of your choice. Some organizations, including Infosys, have provisions for employees to take a sabbatical or study leave to pursue higher education. However, this would depend on your employer's policies and your duration of employment with the company.

C. Some companies have tie-ups with universities or institutes to provide higher education opportunities for their employees. You can explore such options within Infosys or other companies to advance your academic qualifications.

2. How can I get into Infosys, Gurgaon, after my training in Mysore?

After completing your training at Infosys Mysore, you will likely be assigned to one of the company's development centers, based on Infosys' business requirements and needs. To get into the Infosys Gurgaon center, you have a few options:

A. While undergoing the training at Mysore, you can express your preference for the Gurgaon location during the location allocation process. Although there is no guarantee that you will be placed in Gurgaon, expressing your preference will increase the likelihood of being allocated to that location.

B. Once posted to a particular location, you should focus on performing well in your job and establishing yourself as a valuable employee. After a certain period, you can request a transfer to the Gurgaon location, citing personal or professional reasons such as family ties or better career opportunities.

C. Alternatively, you can network with employees or managers in the Gurgaon location and discuss potential opportunities or openings. If you have the right skills and your request is supported by strong reasons, the management might consider your transfer request to Gurgaon.

Remember that, ultimately, any location or project allocations largely depend on the company's needs. Demonstrating excellence in your work and maintaining a strong professional network will increase your chances of moving to your preferred location.
