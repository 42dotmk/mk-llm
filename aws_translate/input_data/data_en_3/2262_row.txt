Title: Pippa Middleton's Feast Tips Receives Flak, Waitrose Ensures Damage Control

Intro:
As Waitrose plans to bring Pippa Middleton on board to offer advice on preparing delicious feasts, the announcement has been met with a barrage of complaints from Waitrose's patrons. The social media channels of the upmarket supermarket chain were flooded with negative comments about the Duchess of Cambridge’s sister, leading to an urgent damage control situation.

Body:
The recent announcement by Waitrose that Pippa Middleton, the sister of the Duchess of Cambridge, would be dispensing advice on preparing feasts has sparked a wave of outrage amongst shoppers. The supermarket chain's social media accounts, including Twitter and Facebook, have been inundated with complaints and disapproval.

Many patrons voiced their concerns about the decision to associate Pippa with Waitrose, stating that it shows a lack of relevant experience and credibility. Shoppers also complained that while Pippa comes from a privileged background, she may not be the best spokesperson for practical and affordable grocery shopping. This created a perception of Waitrose as out-of-touch and disconnected from the average customer’s needs.

In response to the backlash, the editor of Waitrose magazine interceded to appease the customers and damage control the situation. The editor assured the angry mob that despite Pippa's association, Waitrose remains dedicated to delivering fresh, sustainable, and affordable food to its customers. Furthermore, the addition of Pippa's expertise would only enhance the culinary experience for customers without compromising on the brand's ethos.

Moreover, it was highlighted that Pippa Middleton is not new to giving out advice on party planning and entertaining at home. She had previously authored a book, 'Celebrate: A Year of Festivities for Families and Friends,' in 2012 that serves as a guide to hosting a range of celebrations requiring varying degrees of formality.

The editor also emphasized that Pippa's tips would be focused on the joy of cooking and creating memorable feasts at home. The content would include recipes featuring seasonal ingredients, new techniques, and shortcuts, which would cater to food lovers across the board.

Despite the uproar, Waitrose believes that having Pippa Middleton on board can bring many benefits to their customers. Her popularity can help boost sales and bring in new clientele interested in the latest trends in cooking and hosting. Capitalizing on her status as a fashion and lifestyle icon, the supermarket chain aims to enhance the overall experience of shopping at Waitrose by offering customers guidance from someone well-versed in the art of entertaining.

Conclusion:
The controversy surrounding Pippa Middleton's association with Waitrose reveals the importance of maintaining the fine line between celebrity endorsement and credibility. Waitrose has worked to address customers' concerns and clarify the role that Pippa will play in the supermarket chain's future. Despite the criticism, it is hoped that the collaboration will bring new and exciting culinary experiences to the loyal customer base, while also drawing the attention of potential new shoppers.
