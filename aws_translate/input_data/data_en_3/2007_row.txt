Her children ate 25% of the 16 brownies so they ate .25 * 16 = 4 slices. There were 16 brownies and the children ate 4 slices, leaving 16 - 4 = 12 brownies. The family ate 50% of the remaining 12 brownies so they ate .50 * 12 = 6 brownies. There were 12 brownies and they ate 6 which leaves 12 - 6 = 6 brownies. Lorraine had 1 more of the 6 remaining brownies which leaves 6 - 1 = 5 brownies.
The answer: 5
Reverse engineering the question: Lorraine made a pan of brownies and cut them into 16 pieces. Her children ate 25% of the brownies when they got home from school. After dinner, the entire family ate 50% of the remaining brownies. After everyone went to bed, Lorraine ate 1 more brownie. How many brownies are left over?

Reasoning and answer: First find the net amount of ivy Cary removes each day by subtracting the ivy's growth from the amount she removes: 6 feet / day - 2 feet / day = 4 feet / day. Then divide the total feet of ivy by the net amount Cary removes each day to find how many days it takes her to remove all the ivy: 40 feet / 4 feet / day = 10 days.
The answer: 10

Question: Cary is trying to strip the ivy off a tree in her yard. She strips 6 feet of ivy every day, but the ivy grows another 2 feet every night. If the tree is covered by 40 feet of ivy, how many days will it take Cary to strip all the ivy off?

First find the number of water breaks James takes: 240 minutes / 20 minutes / water break = 12 water breaks. Then find the number of sitting breaks James takes: 240 minutes / 120 minutes / sitting break = 2 sitting breaks. Then subtract the number of sitting breaks from the number of water breaks to find the difference: 12 breaks - 2 breaks = 10 breaks.
The answer: 10
Reverse engineering the question: James works for 240 minutes. He takes a water break every 20 minutes and a sitting break every 120 minutes. How many more water breaks does he take than sitting breaks?

Reasoning and answer: The total height of the first to 100th floor is 100 x 16.5 = 1650 feet. Hence, the 101st floor is 1673 - 1650 = 23 feet high.
The answer: 23
What was the question?
Question: Taipei 101 in Taiwan is 1,673 feet tall with 101 floors. Suppose the first to 100th floors have height each equal to 16.5 feet, how high is the 101st floor?

First, we need to determine how much Johnny makes in one day. To start, we perform 3 * 7 = 21 dollars for the first job. Second, we perform 2 * 10 = 20 dollars for the second job. Third, we perform 4 * 12 = 48 dollars for the third job. Altogether, Johnny makes 21 + 20 + 48 = 89 dollars in a day. We multiply this amount by the 5 days, performing 5 * 89 = 445 dollars over 5 days.
The answer: 445
Reverse engineering the question: Johnny spent 3 hours working on a job that paid $7 per hour, 2 hours working on a job that paid $10 an hour, and 4 hours working on a job that paid $12 an hour. Assuming he repeats this process 5 days in a row, how much does Johnny make?

The range of scores is the difference between the highest and the least score so 75 = 98 - least score. Then the least score = 98 - 75 = 23. Mark scored twice as much as the least score which is 2 * 23 = 46.
The answer: 46
