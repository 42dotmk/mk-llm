Question: Wade has a hot dog food truck. He makes $2.00 in tips per customer. On Friday he served 28 customers. He served three times that amount of customers on Saturday. On Sunday, he served 36 customers. How many dollars did he make in tips between the 3 days?
Answer: On Saturday, he served 3 times the amount of customers that he served on Friday, which was 28 customers so he served 3 * 28 = 84 customers. He served 28 customers on Friday, 84 on Saturday and 36 customers on Sunday for a total of 28 + 84 + 36 = 148 customers. Each customer tipped him $2.00 and he had 148 customers so he made 2 * 148 = $296.00. The answer is 296.
[Question]Jackson had 20 kilograms of meat. He used 1/4 of the meat to make meatballs and used 3 kilograms of meat to make spring rolls. How many kilograms of meat are left?
[Answer]Jackson used 20 x 1 / 4 = 5 kilograms of meat to make meatballs. He had 20 - 5 = 15 kilograms of meat left. So 15 - 3 = 12 kilograms of meat are left. The answer is 12.
Q: Manny is making lasagna for dinner with his four friends, Lisa, Raphael, Aaron, and Kai. He needs to know how many pieces to cut the lasagna into to serve it. Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?
A: Manny will eat 1 piece. Aaron will eat 0 pieces. Kai will eat twice as much as Manny, so he will eat 2 * 1 = 2 pieces. Raphael will eat half as much as Manny, so he will eat 1 * 1 / 2 = 1 / 2 piece. Lisa will eat 2 pieces plus the remainder of Raphaelâ€™s piece, so she will eat 2 + 1 / 2 = 2 1 / 2 pieces. Together, they will eat 1 + 0 + 2 + 1 / 2 + 2 1 / 2 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 pieces. Thus, Manny should cut his lasagna into 6 pieces. The answer is 6.
Question: Alexa was on vacation for 3/4ths of the time it took Ethan to learn 12 fencing tricks. Joey spent half as much this time (that Ethan spent learning the tricks) learning to swim. If Alexa spent a week and 2 days on vacation, how many days did it take Joey to learn swimming?
Answer: There are 7 days in one week so one week and 2 days = 7 + 2 = 9 days. Call the time Ethan spends learning tricks e. Alexa spent 9 days on vacation which is 3 / 4ths of the time Ethan spent learning 12 fencing tricks, hence (3 / 4)e = 9 days. If we multiply both sides of this equation by 4 / 3, we get e = (4 / 3) * 9 days = 12 days. Joey spent half of 12 days which is 12 / 2 = 6 days to learn swimming. The answer is 6.
[Question]Bridge and Sarah have $3 between them. If Bridget has 50 cents more than Sarah, how many cents does Sarah have?
[Answer]Let X be the amount of money Sarah has, so Bridget has X + 50 cents. We know that Sarah and Bridget combined have $3, or 300 cents, so X + X + 50 = 300. We therefore know that 2X = 250. So Sarah has 250 / 2 = 125 cents. The answer is 125.
