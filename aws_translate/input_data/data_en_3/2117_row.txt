Reverse engineering the question: Dilan, Martha, Phillip, and Veronica went to the park together to have some fun. They all had a different number of marbles: Dilan had 14 marbles, Martha had 20 marbles, Phillip had 19 marbles and finally, Veronica had only 7 marbles. They wanted to redistribute the marbles so they each had an equal number. How many marbles did each friend have at the end of the day?

Reasoning and answer: First find the total number of striped nails: 20 nails - 6 nails - 8 nails = 6 nails. Then divide the number of blue nails by the number of total nails and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 8 blue nails / 20 total nails * 100% = 40%. Then divide the number of striped nails by the number of total nails and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 6 striped nails / 20 total nails * 100% = 30%. Then subtract the percentage of striped nails from the percentage of blue nails to find the difference: 40% - 30% = 10%.
The answer: 10

Reasoning and answer: After the first month you get 10 / 100 * $300 = $30 interest. After the first month you will have $300 + $30 = $330 in total. After the second month you get = 10 / 100 * $330 = $33 interest. After the second month you will have $330 + $33 = $363 in total.
The answer: 363

Question: An investment bank gives 10 percent interest at the end of every month. How much money in total will you have, including interest, at the end of 2 months if you invest $300?

Reasoning and answer: Since each package weighed 4 pounds, the first butcher delivered 10 * 4 = 40 pounds. The second butcher's delivery was 7 * 4 = 28 pounds. The first two butchers therefore delivered 40 + 28 = 68 pounds. Subtracting that weight from the total weight of ground beef gives 100 - 68 = 32 pounds. It therefore means the third butcher delivered 32 / 4 = 8 packages.
The answer: 8
