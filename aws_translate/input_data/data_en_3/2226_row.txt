Passage: Samuel Francis Smith wrote the lyrics to "My Country' Tis of Thee" in 1831, while he was a student at the Andover Theological Seminary in Andover, Massachusetts. His friend Lowell Mason had asked him to translate the lyrics in some German school songbooks or to write new lyrics. A melody in Muzio Clementi's Symphony No. 3 (also called' The Great National' and contains the melody of' God Save the Queen' as a tribute to Clementi's adopted country) caught his attention.
