After evaluating the concrete using a Moh's hardness pick, the most logical next event is to proceed with the actual polishing process. Concrete polishing is a multi-step procedure that results in a high-gloss and smooth finish. It involves grinding, honing, and polishing the surface, and can also include densifying and sealing the concrete. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to polish concrete:

1. Choose the appropriate equipment and tools: Make sure you have the correct tools and equipment for the job. For large-scale projects, consider using a walk-behind, stand-up, or ride-on machine. For smaller surfaces, a hand-held grinder or floor polisher may suffice. You will also need diamond-impregnated abrasive discs with varying grits (starting from low to high) and a floor vacuum or dust collector to manage the dust generated during the process.

2. Prepare the surface: Remove any debris, sealants, adhesives, or coatings from the concrete surface. Repair any cracks and imperfections to ensure a smooth substrate. You can use an angle grinder with a diamond cup wheel or other appropriate tools to grind away any inconsistencies.

3. Start the grinding process: Begin with a low-grit diamond abrasive disc (such as 30 or 50 grit) attached to your grinder or polisher. Begin grinding in a forward and backward motion, covering small sections at a time. Be sure to overlap your passes to ensure even grinding. This step will remove any small imperfections and surface stains and open the pores of the concrete, preparing it for the honing phase.

4. Honing the surface: Switch to a higher-grit diamond abrasive disc (for example, 100 or 200 grit). Repeat the process, going over the entire surface. This step will remove scratches and provide a smoother finish. Continue to change the discs to higher grits (400, 800, etc.) until you achieve the desired level of shine and smoothness. Each progressive grit will remove scratches left by the previous one.

5. Apply a densifier: To enhance the hardness and durability of the surface, apply a concrete densifier. The densifier penetrates the concrete, filling the pores and reacts with the calcium hydroxide, forming a harder, more durable surface. Allow the densifier to cure according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

6. Polishing the surface: For achieving a high-gloss finish, switch to a fine-grit diamond abrasive disc (at least 800 grit or higher). Pass over the entire surface, achieving a consistent and glossy finish. Remember to overlap passes.

7. Apply a sealer (optional): Once the desired gloss has been achieved, you may apply a sealer to protect the polished surface. Select a sealer compatible with your concrete and follow the manufacturer's recommendations for application and curing.

8. Cleanup and maintenance: Properly clean and maintain the equipment after use. Dust and debris should be vacuumed, or the floor should be mopped. For long-term care, periodic cleaning with a neutral-pH cleaner is recommended to maintain the polished surface.

By following these steps, you can successfully complete the concrete polishing process, providing an aesthetically pleasing and durable result that is low-maintenance and long-lasting.
