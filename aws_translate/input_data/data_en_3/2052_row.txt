The first two questions you posed, "Can people actively control their emotions?" and "How should I control my emotion?", are related but not identical. They deal with different aspects of the same general topic, which is emotion control. The first is asking whether such control is possible, while the second is seeking advice on how to exert control.

To answer the first question, yes, people can actively control their emotions, to a certain extent. This ability is also known as emotional regulation. It's a complex process that involves several different strategies, including:

1. **Cognitive Reappraisal:** Changing the way you think about a situation in order to alter its emotional impact. For example, if you're stuck in traffic, instead of getting frustrated about the delay, you might remind yourself that it's an opportunity to listen to more of your audiobook.

2. **Expressive Suppression:** Making a conscious effort to hide your emotional responses, especially in a social context. For instance, not showing anger or disappointment even if you feel it.

3. **Situation Selection:** Deliberately choosing to place yourself in situations that will provoke desired emotions, and avoiding those that will provoke undesired ones. For example, if you know that certain locations or events trigger negative emotions, you might decide not to go there or attend them.

4. **Distraction:** When you're feeling emotional, distract yourself by doing other tasks you love to get your mind off the negative emotion.

To answer the second question, "how should I control my emotion?," different strategies work for different people. Some may find distraction effective, whereas others may prefer cognitive reappraisal. The efficacy of these techniques might also depend on the specific emotional experiences and psychological traits of the individual. In general, though, some common strategies include:

1. **Mindfulness:** Cultivating an awareness of your thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations in the present moment can help distance you from intense emotional reactions. 

2. **Deep Breathing:** This can help calm your body's stress response and make it easier to think clearly about your emotions.

3. **Journaling:** Writing about your feelings can help clarify them and make them less overwhelming.

4. **Physical Activity:** Exercise and other physical activities can help reduce feelings of anxiety and improve mood.

5. **Healthy Sleep and Eating Habits:** Physical health is closely tied with emotional health, so taking care of your body can help regulate your emotions.

Additionally, professional help from therapists or psychologists can help you enhance your emotional regulation capabilities. This can be particularly beneficial if you find it hard to manage your emotions on your own.

Concerning your third question, "Do those questions have the same meaning?", no, they do not have the exact same meaning. As mentioned earlier, the first question alludes to the capability of controlling emotions, while the second seeks practical methods on doing so. While they are similar in their focus on emotional control, they address different aspects of the larger topic and therefore, are not the same.
