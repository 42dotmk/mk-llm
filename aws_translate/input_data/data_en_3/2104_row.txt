A good score on the Miller Analogies Test (MAT) depends on the requirements of the specific graduate program or institution you are considering, as well as how your score compares to those of other test-takers in the same pool. The MAT is a standardized test commonly used for graduate school admissions in the United States. It measures a candidate's ability to understand complex relationships and similarities through the use of analogies.

The MAT consists of 120 analogy-based questions, which are divided into four categories:

1. Semantic: These questions test vocabulary knowledge and general reasoning abilities.
2. Analytic: These questions require understanding relationships among terms and how these relationships apply to novel situations.
3. Classification: These questions test a candidate's ability to group items based on shared properties.
4. Syntactic: These questions examine understanding of word order and patterns in sentences.

From these 120 questions, only 100 items contribute to the examinee's final score. The other 20 items are experimental and are used to evaluate their suitability for future test editions. Test-takers have 60 minutes to complete the MAT.

MAT scores are reported as both a raw score and a scaled score, which range from 200 to 600. The raw score is simply the number of questions answered correctly, while the scaled score is adjusted to account for differences in difficulty between different test editions. The test developer, Pearson, also provides a percentile rank for the scaled scores, which show the percentage of test-takers scoring below a given score.

Now, to determine what a "good" score is, consider the following factors:

1. Graduate program requirements: Some graduate programs have minimum MAT score requirements, while others provide score ranges for their typical successful applicants. To identify what may be considered a good score for the program you are interested in, research the program's website or contact their admissions office.

2. Comparisons to other test-takers: Percentile ranks provide a useful comparison to understand how your score compares to others. A higher percentile rank indicates better performance as compared to other test-takers. Generally, a percentile rank of 50 or above would indicate that you scored higher than half of the test-takers, while a rank above 70 or 80 would place you in the top 30% or 20%, respectively.

3. Personal goals: Consider your own academic background and the competitiveness of the programs you are applying to when setting a personal target MAT score.

To provide a general idea, examinees who score around 400 or above are typically considered to have performed well on the MAT. However, highly competitive graduate programs may expect scores closer to 500 or even higher to stand out in the applicant pool.

In conclusion, a good score on the Miller Analogies Test depends on several factors, including the requirements of the graduate program you are interested in, how your score compares to other test-takers, and your personal goals. To increase your chances of admission, strive for a score significantly above the minimum required or the average score range for your desired program.
