Nemaja Matic’s red card against Burnley on Saturday comes as a severe blow for Jose Mourinho’s Capital One Cup final plans. The 26-year-old midfielder was sent off for pushing Burnley player forward Ashley Barnes following an awful challenge on the Serbian during the 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge. Barnes mistimed his challenge, catching Matic with his studs, but it was missed by referee Martin Atkinson who did not even give a free kick to the title challengers. Ashley Barnes chops down Nemanja Matic during the 1-1 draw between Chelsea and Burnley on Saturday Unsurprisingly Matic sees red and pushed the Burnley player to the ground out of anger on Saturday
