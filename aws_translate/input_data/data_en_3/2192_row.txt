The soldiers were proper and kept the vests but not the boots because of multiple factors that contributed to the decision-making process during their meticulous planning and execution. The reasons for choosing the vests over the boots can be classified under two primary headings:

1. Functional Utility:
The soldiers, who were clad in their battle-hardened gear, found the vests to be more advantageous when it came to fulfilling their tactical objectives. The vests provided them with ample protection, enhanced mobility, and the flexibility required to adapt to rapidly evolving scenarios on the battlefield. With the integration of advanced materials and designs, the vests effectively shielded the soldiers from enemy fire and minimized injuries. Additionally, these vests facilitated the ideal weight distribution for carrying an extensive range of equipment and ammunition, thereby enabling the soldiers to partake in intensive combat operations while reducing fatigue.

On the other hand, the boots failed to cater to the specific requirements and expectations of the soldiers. With prolonged use and exposure to harsh environmental conditions, the boots demonstrated shortcomings in terms of durability and resilience. Moreover, the subpar quality construction and absence of a suitable support system rendered the boots uncomfortable and incompatible with the intense physical demands of combat. This resulted in the soldiers opting against using the boots, as they were unsuitable for facilitating optimal performance.

2. Adaptation to Terrain:
Varying geographical terrains played a pivotal role in influencing the soldiers' decision to keep the vests and discard the boots. The vests, being fundamental to their standard operational gear, facilitated seamless maneuverability and adaptability for diverse terrains and topographies. The adjustable and modular design of these vests further enabled the soldiers to modify their gear as per the unpredictability of the battlefield.

In contrast, the boots were unable to cater to the adaptive nature required for traversing through different terrains. The suboptimal design, coupled with the lack of waterproofing, breathability, and insulation features, rendered the boots inefficient for withstanding diverse and extreme climatic conditions. Additionally, the undersized and rigid structure of the boots hampered the soldiers' ability to negotiate challenging obstacles and negotiate difficult terrains, thereby significantly diminishing their capability to adopt tailored combat strategies effectively.

In conclusion, the soldiers made a calculated decision to retain the vests and abandon the boots based on the two essential factors mentioned above. The vests proved to be superior in terms of functional utility, securely protecting the soldiers while allowing them to carry vital equipment with ease. Moreover, the vests aided the soldiers in adapting effortlessly to the dynamic battle terrains, thus ensuring the flawless execution of their operations. Conversely, the boots were deemed ineffective both in design and utility, affecting the soldiers' comfort and adaptability in challenging combat conditions, which ultimately led to their unanimous rejection.
