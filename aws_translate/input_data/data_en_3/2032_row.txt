[Question]Conner has a dune buggy that he rides in the desert. On flat sand, it can ride at a speed of 60 miles per hour. When traveling on downhill slopes, it can race at 12 miles per hour faster than it can when it is on flat sand. And when riding on an uphill inclined slow, it travels at a speed 18 miles per hour slower than when it is riding on flat sand. If Conner rides his dune buggy one-third of the time on flat sand, one-third of the time on uphill slopes, and one-third of the time on downhill slopes, what is his average speed in miles per hour?
[Answer]12 mph faster than 60mph is 60 + 12 = 72 mph. 18 mph slower than 60 mph is 60 - 18 = 42 mph. If he spends 1 / 3 of the time at each of these three speeds, then he averages (60 + 72 + 42) / 3 = 58 mph. The answer is 58.
Q: Missy had a giant piggy bank in her bedroom. Every day she would search the house for change to put in her bank. After 4 years, the bank was opened and it contained $450 in change. If the second, third, and fourth-year she doubled the amount of money she put in the bank from the amount she had put in the previous year, how much money, in dollars, did she put in the bank the first year?
A: We let x be the amount of money she put in the bank the first year,. Then the second year was 2 * x,. and the third year was 2 * 2 * x = 4 * x,. and the fourth year was 2 * 2 * 2 * x = 8 * x. And the total amount she put in the bank, $450, is the sum of all four years, or $450 = x + (2 * x) + (4 * x) + (8 * x). This simplifies to $450 = 15 * x. And therefore, the amount of money she put in the bank the first year was x = $30. The answer is 30.
Question: Chastity made 12 angel food cakes to give to friends. She placed the cakes in boxes, and then walked them out to her car. But she had forgotten her keys. So, she placed the boxes of cakes in one stack on the hood of her car, and then she ran back into the house to get her keys.

When Chastity returned, she picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, but the rest of the cakes were destroyed. How many cakes were destroyed?
Answer: There were 12 / 2 = 6 fallen cakes. Half of 6 fallen cakes were destroyed, for a total of 6 / 2 = 3 cakes. The answer is 3.
