[Question]Julieta went to the store to buy a backpack and three ring-binders for her school supplies. She knew the backpack was $50, and each ring-binder cost was $20. However, at the store, she found out that the price of a back had increased by $5, and the price of a ring-binder had reduced by $2. Calculate the total amount of money Julieta spent at the store.
[Answer]Initially, a backpack cost was $50; when it increased by $5, the price became $50 + $5 = $55. The price of a ring - binder $20, when it reduced by $2, the price became $20 - $2 = $18. If she wanted to buy 3 ring - binders, she spent $18 * 3 = $54. In total, Julieta spent $55 + $54 = $109. The answer is 109.
Q: Quinton is looking to add 4 fruit trees to his backyard. He wants to plant 2 apple trees that will be 10 feet wide each and need 12 feet between them. The peach trees will be closer to the house and will grow to be 12 feet wide and will need 15 feet between each tree. All told, how much space will these trees take up in his yard?
A: Both apple trees will be 10 feet wide at maturity so they will be 2 * 10 = 20 feet wide. Quinton will need to leave 12 feet between these 2 trees so the apple trees will take up 20 + 12 = 32 feet. Both peach trees will be 12 feet wide at maturity so they will be 2 * 12 = 24 feet wide. Quinton will need to leave 15 feet between these 2 trees so the peach trees will take up 24 + 15 = 39 feet. Together, the apple trees will take up 32 feet and the peach trees will take up 39 feet so they will take 32 + 39 = 71 feet. The answer is 71.
Question: The journey from Abel's house to Alice's house is 35 miles and is divided into 5 equal portions. Abel is driving at a speed of 40 miles per hour. After traveling for 0.7 hours, how many portions of the journey has he covered?
Answer: 35 miles into 5 equal portions will be 35 / 5 = 7 miles each. Abel traveled at a speed of 40 miles per hour for 0.7 hours so he will cover 40 * 0.7 = 28 miles. 7 miles make a portion so 28 miles is equivalent to 28 / 7 = 4 portions. The answer is 4.
[Question]Salem loves to write poems, and she always stores her poem in a creativity box kept safely in her home library. Last week, she created a poem with 20 stanzas. If each stanza has 10 lines, and each line has 8 words, calculate the total number of words in the poem.
[Answer]If each line that Salem created in her poem has 8 words, the total number of words in a stanza, which is 10 lines, is 8 words / line * 10 lines / stanza = 80 words / stanza. With 20 stanzas, each containing 80 words per stanza, the total is 80 words / stanza * 20 stanzas = 1600 words in all the stanzas(poem). The answer is 1600.
