The majority of Italian immigrants settled in the United States, primarily in the urban areas of the northeastern region, as well as in the cities of the Midwestern and Western states. This significant wave of immigration took place mainly from the late 19th century to the early 20th century, and the choices of destinations were influenced by various factors such as employment opportunities, existing Italian communities, and family connections. 

Between 1880 and 1924, approximately four million Italian immigrants arrived in the United States, with the majority of them coming from the impoverished regions of Southern Italy and Sicily. This population movement was driven primarily by factors such as poverty, limited prospects for social and economic mobility, and political instability in Italy. As a result, Italian immigrants sought better living conditions, jobs, and opportunities in other countries, primarily the United States.

The majority of these Italian immigrants settled in the northeastern urban areas, specifically in cities such as New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. These locations offered numerous employment opportunities, particularly in industries such as garment manufacturing, construction, mining, and railroad building. For instance, New York City, the most significant Italian immigrant destination in the United States, saw the establishment of several Italian neighborhoods within its boroughs, including Little Italy in downtown Manhattan, Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, and Arthur Avenue in the Bronx.

Italian immigrants also made their way to other regions within the United States. In the Midwest, Chicago and Detroit attracted a sizable number of Italian immigrants, many of whom found employment in factories, automobile manufacturing, steel mills, and meatpacking. In the West, cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Denver saw the growth of Italian communities, as immigrants became involved in industries such as fishing, agriculture, and wine production.

In addition to economic opportunities, Italian immigrants often chose their destinations based on connections, family ties, and existing Italian communities. Chain migration played a crucial role in the settlement patterns of Italian immigrants, as they were more likely to choose cities and towns where friends and family members had already successfully established themselves. This sense of community and connection to their Italian heritage helped to create cultural enclaves and neighborhoods where the language, customs, and traditions of Italy were preserved and passed onto future generations.

While the United States was the primary destination for Italian immigrants, other countries also saw an influx of Italians during this period, including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, and Australia. However, the United States remained the most popular destination due to its promise of economic prosperity, personal freedom, and a chance for a better life far away from the challenges and strife faced in Italy at the time. Today, the legacy of Italian immigration continues to shape the cultural, economic, and social fabric of the United States, as well as the lives of millions of Italian-Americans who call this country home.
