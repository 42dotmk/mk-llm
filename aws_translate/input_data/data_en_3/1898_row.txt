The definition you provided, "The genome includes both the genes and the non-coding sequences of the DNA/RNA," is correct. However, this does not answer the original question about the fields of science in which the genome is studied. Here is a more detailed and long answer addressing the question:

A genome is the complete set of genetic information encoded in an organism's DNA or RNA. The study of genomes is essential for understanding various biological processes and functions, and numerous scientific fields contribute to research in genomics. Some of these fields include:

1. Genetics: This is the fundamental field that studies genes, genetic variation, and heredity in organisms. The study of genomes within genetics delves into understanding inheritance patterns, identifying gene functions, and discovering how mutations can lead to genetic diseases.

2. Molecular Biology: This field investigates the molecular interactions and processes within a cell, focusing on the roles of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Studying genomes in molecular biology helps unravel the mechanisms of gene expression and regulation, as well as understanding how different molecules interact with genetic material.

3. Biochemistry: The study of biochemical processes within living organisms is crucial in understanding gene function. Researchers investigate how genes code for the synthesis and degradation of biomolecules, their interactions, and how these influence cellular processes and pathways.

4. Bioinformatics: This interdisciplinary field combines computer science, biology, and mathematics to analyze and interpret large-scale biological data sets, such as genome sequences. Bioinformaticians develop algorithms and software tools to study relationships between genes, proteins, and regulatory elements, facilitating the understanding of gene function, evolution, and disease mechanisms.

5. Evolutionary Biology: The study of genomes in this context allows scientists to examine the genetic differences among species throughout evolution. Comparing genomes can reveal evolutionary relationships between organisms, the conservation of essential genes, and the emergence of new genes that may contribute to the unique characteristics of a species.

6. Genomic Medicine: In this field, researchers investigate the genetic basis of diseases and develop therapeutic strategies targeting specific genetic components. Whole-genome sequencing and functional genomics studies have identified genes and genomic elements associated with various disorders, leading to personalized medicine and gene therapy approaches in the clinic.

7. Environmental Genomics: This branch of genomics explores how organisms interact with their environments on a genetic level. Environmental genomics examines gene-environment interactions, identifies genes responsible for adaptation to specific habitats, and studies the role of genomes in shaping ecological processes.

These fields, along with many others, contribute to the comprehensive understanding of genomes, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying various biological processes and advancing the knowledge and applications in medicine, agriculture, and environmental science.
