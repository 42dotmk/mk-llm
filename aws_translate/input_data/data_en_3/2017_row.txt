Ali, who was now sitting a bit closer to him than before. He decided to take advantage of this newfound comfort to strike up a conversation with both of them and get to know them better, hoping to deepen their connection and forge stronger bonds among the three of them. He began by inquiring about their individual interests and hobbies.

Sal, as it turns out, was passionate about photography and had an eye for capturing the perfect moments, be it a breathtaking landscape or an intimate candid shot. It was easy to see that this creative outlet was an essential aspect of Sal's life by the way he spoke about it. He even carried his camera with him wherever he went, and his portfolio was filled with an incredible array of shots that told countless stories.

On the other hand, Ali's interest revolved around literature and writing. She had a vast collection of books, encompassing various genres and authors. Her favorites were the classics, which had the ability to transport her back to the periods and locations they were set in, and she could often be found curled up on her armchair, lost between the pages of a good book, oblivious to her surroundings. Ali also enjoyed writing her own short stories and poems, some of which were published in local magazines and received positive reception, further fueling her passion for the craft.

As the conversation flowed and they delved deeper, they found other common interests among themselves, such as music, traveling, and a shared love for good food. They reminisced about their favorite concerts, the beautiful places they wished to visit someday, and culinary adventures they had embarked upon.

He felt that under different circumstances, they might have been great friends, even without the laughter that had brought them closer. However, he couldn't quite shake off the gravity of the situation they were in, with the recent drugged experiences they'd had. It was a dark cloud that still loomed in the back of their minds, threatening to overshadow their bright conversation.

Though subtle, he sensed that Sal and Ali were glad for the camaraderie that had blossomed in such a short amount of time. Their shared experiences had, in a way, forged a unique bond that also acted as a coping mechanism – helping them process the trauma and heal together.

Seeing both Sal and Ali opening up to each other and him, he felt a growing determination to help them overcome their past experiences and forge a path toward healing. As they continued to laugh, chat, and share their stories, the dynamic among the three developed into a strong and supportive connection.

He realized that sometimes, amidst adversity, laughter could indeed be the best medicine. It not only cleared the tension but also offered them an anchor – a sense of hope and understanding in a world that seemed to be spiraling out of control. It brought them back to their humanity, reminding them of the joy they were capable of experiencing, despite the dark times they had endured. And as they continued walking down this newfound path, hand in hand, they began to rebuild and rediscover the strength within themselves, drawing upon the power of friendship and the healing nature of laughter.
