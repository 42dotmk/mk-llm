John Lecor, a washed-up journalist, decides to leave his dead-end job at a local newspaper in Los Angeles and head to Memphis, Tennessee for a fresh start. However, on the morning of his departure, he receives a mysterious letter signed by an unknown source. The letter contains only one line - "Where is Lecor flown to Memphis, Tennessee?"

Intrigued by the cryptic message, Lecor decides to unearth the truth behind it. The plot thickens when Lecor arrives in Memphis to discover that the city is being plagued by a string of bizarre occurrences. A series of bank robberies, with the victims being left alive but in a state of temporary amnesia, have the police baffled. As he delves deeper into the story, Lecor finds himself uncovering a hidden world of crime and intrigue.

The city's most prolific crime lord, Alastair King, orchestrates kidnappings, drug deals, and political machinations to control the city's underworld with an iron fist. Unbeknownst to Lecor, King is also intimately connected to the recent bank robberies. The amnesia suffered by those affected is the result of a groundbreaking technology designed to extract memories and information.

While working his way through the seedy criminal underworld of Memphis, Lecor enlists the help of a rogue detective named Victoria Mitchell. The two quickly uncover that the cryptic letter Lecor received had been sent by a former victim of King's memory extraction technology in a desperate attempt to warn him about the dangers he faces in Memphis.

As they investigate further, Lecor and Mitchell begin to unravel the truth behind the amnesiac bank robberies and the origin of the mysterious technology. They discover that King is using this technology to gather information that will allow him to exercise more significant control over the city's political and financial infrastructure, positioning himself to take over Memphis entirely.

Together, the duo tenaciously pursue King and his network of criminals, capturing his right-hand man and decrypting information that leads them to King's secret lab, where the memory extraction technology is stored. The stakes are higher than ever when Lecor is captured and subjected to the memory extraction procedure by King himself. It's a race against time as Mitchell and her team work to rescue Lecor, dismantle the criminal network, and bring King to justice.

With the help of his new allies, Lecor is saved from the memory extraction procedure, and King's operation is shut down. The war against corruption and crime in Memphis is ongoing, but thanks to the investigative prowess of Lecor and Mitchell, the streets are much safer.
