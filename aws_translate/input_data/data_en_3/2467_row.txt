While both of these questions have similar themes and may lead to similar advice, they have slightly different meanings:

1. "What should I do get over a girl?"
In this question, the person is asking for advice or steps for getting over a girl or a romantic interest they are emotionally attached to. The specific reason for wanting to get over her is not mentioned. It could be due to a breakup, unrequited love, or any other reason that makes it necessary for them to move on from their feelings for this girl.

2. "How do I get over a girl I cannot be with?"
This question is more specific about the reason behind needing to get over the girl. In this case, the person acknowledges that they cannot be with her, possibly due to external circumstances, personal choices, or other barriers that prevent them from being together. The focus is on coping with the feelings that arise from the impossibility of the relationship.

To answer both of these questions, here are some general steps and advice for getting over a girl or romantic interest:

1. Acceptance: The first step towards healing is recognizing and accepting that the relationship has ended, or you cannot be with her. This involves acknowledging the reality and letting go of any hope or expectations for a future together.

2. Give yourself time to grieve: It is natural to feel sad, angry, or confused after a breakup, or when you realize that you cannot be with the person you desire. Allow yourself to experience these emotions without judgment or self-blame.

3. Cut off contact: If it is not possible to maintain a healthy, casual friendship with the girl, it might be helpful to cut off contact temporarily. Create some distance between you and the person, both physically and virtually (on social media, for instance).

4. Focus on self-improvement: Invest in yourself by engaging in activities that make you feel good and help you grow as an individual. This could include exercising, developing new hobbies, learning new skills, reading, or joining social clubs.

5. Seek support: Talk to trusted friends or family members about your feelings. They can provide a listening ear and offer constructive advice. Additionally, you may consider seeking professional help from a therapist if your emotions are overwhelming you.

6. Create new memories: Start participating in new experiences that can create new, positive memories without the presence of the girl you are trying to get over. This helps reshape your view of life and rebuild your identity without her.

7. Set new goals: Set new personal or professional goals to work towards. This can help you focus on your growth and future, rather than dwelling on the past.

8. Stay patient: Healing takes time, and getting over someone does not happen overnight. Be patient with yourself, and know that it is okay for the process to take a while.

In summary, while both questions are centered around dealing with feelings for a girl, the main difference lies in the specificity of the situation - whether the motivation for moving on is unspecified or due to acknowledging that they cannot be with the person in question. Regardless, the recommendations to deal with the emotions arising from either situation are quite similar.
