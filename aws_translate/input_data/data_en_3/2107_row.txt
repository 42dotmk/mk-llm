Treatment for the baby is ongoing, and given the complexity of his condition, the path to recovery is steep. His family, underlining the importance of perseverance and patience, is committed to providing the best for him and ensuring he hits every developmental milestone.

Stories like these serve as stark reminders of the unintentional victims of gun violence. Yet, they also highlight the invincible spirit of survival and an overwhelming force of faith and hope in the face of the direst circumstances.
