There are multiple factors that prevent a group of well-intentioned billionaires from pouring €10B into Greece's banks to save the country and Greeks from financial collapse. Here are some of the key reasons:

1. Legal restrictions: International financial regulations, as well as regulatory laws in respective billionaires' countries, may limit the transfer of such large sums of money into another country's banks. These regulations are in place to curb money laundering, tax evasion, and other illicit financial activities.

2. Moral hazard: Introducing a large sum of money to a country's banks to alleviate financial collapse could inadvertently encourage riskier behavior in the future. Banks may take more risks, knowing that they may be bailed out by outside sources if a crisis occurs again.

3. Economic repercussions: Injecting €10B into Greece's banks could lead to inflation, as the country experiences a sudden influx of money. This could hurt the overall economic situation in the country and be counterproductive to the intended goal of stabilizing Greece's financial condition.

4. Political considerations: A large influx of money from private individuals could create or perpetuate the idea of dependence on external forces for financial stability. This could lead to political disagreements within Greece and potential resentment toward the donating billionaires, as their actions could be perceived as interfering with Greece's autonomy.

5. Return on investment: Billionaires would likely consider the potential return on investment (ROI) before deciding to inject funds into Greece's banks. It may not be an appealing investment opportunity if the overall financial condition of the country is unstable, as the chances of getting a substantial ROI could be low.

Regarding your second question about taking a mortgage on your house in a Greek bank hoping for a Grexit, there are several issues to consider:

1. Risk: Taking a mortgage from a Greek bank involves a high degree of risk, especially considering the unstable financial environment in Greece. This may not be a wise financial decision, as there is no guarantee of a Grexit, and the potential consequences could have a lasting negative impact on your finances.

2. International regulations: There are likely regulations and policies in place that govern international mortgages, which could make it difficult or impossible for you to secure a mortgage with a Greek bank while residing in Belgium.

3. Cross-border complexities: Securing a mortgage in a foreign country can be complicated due to differences in regulations, legal systems, and consumer protection laws. This may increase the financial burden and complexity of managing the mortgage, as well as the overall risks associated with your investment.

In conclusion, these two questions are not the same. The first question deals with the potential actions of a group of billionaires that could potentially save Greece from financial collapse. The second question focuses on an individual seeking a mortgage from a Greek bank, possibly hoping to gain an advantage in the event of Greece's exit from the European Union. Therefore, the correct answer to your multi-choice problem is (a) no.
