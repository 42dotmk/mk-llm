Writing an article involves several steps, such as understanding the topic, researching, sorting out relevant data, and articulating them in a structured manner. In this case, the topic at hand involves historical events: the Battle of Poitiers and Edward's permission for John to return to Brittany.

Step 1: Understand the Topic
Firstly, we need to clearly understand the task in hand. The user wants an article that answers the question of which event occurred first: the Battle of Poitiers, or Edward granting permission for John to return to Brittany. To write this article, we'll need to do research and determine the timings of these two historical events.

Step 2: Research
The Battle of Poitiers refers to one of two major historical events â€“ the Battle of Poitiers in 732 where Charles Martel stopped the Arab advance into Western Europe or the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 during the Hundred Years' War. Since we are comparing it with an event involving English and Breton nobility, it's likely the latter scenario, as the Hundred Years' War involved England and France.

Edward, in this instance, likely refers to Edward I of England (reigned 1272-1307). John is presumably John I, Duke of Brittany (reigned 1237-1286). Research reveals that Edward I allowed John I to return to Brittany around 1274.

Step 3: Analyze the Information
Upon analyzing the research data, it is seen that Edward I's permission to John to return to Brittany was in the 13th century, specifically around 1274, whilst the Battle of Poitiers relevant to the English monarchy took place in the 14th century, in 1356 to be precise.

Step 4: Construct the Article
Now that we've gathered and analyzed the necessary data, it's time to write an article detailing the findings. I'll ensure the article is informative and organized, with a clear statement answering the initial question.

Step 5: Proofread and Review
After writing the article, it's crucial to proofread for any potential errors and ensure the article is cohesive, relevant, and accurate.

Here's how the article might look:

Title: Which Happened First: The Battle of Poitiers or Edward Granting Permission to John to Return to Brittany?

History is a grand tapestry, interwoven with countless threads of events. One might find themselves wondering about the sequence of past events, like the Battle of Poitiers and Edward's allowance for John to return to Brittany. This article clarifies which of these events happened first.

To identify which occurred first, we first need to pinpoint the time frames of these events. The Battle of Poitiers involved in this comparison occurred during the Hundred Years' War in the year 1356. This was a decisive battle between the kingdoms of England and France. 

On the other hand, the event of Edward I, King of England, permitting John I, Duke of Brittany, to return to his dukedom is documented to have happened significantly earlier, around 1274, during Edward's reign.

From the analysis, it becomes clear that Edward granting permission for John to return to Brittany happened first, predating the Battle of Poitiers by about 82 years. Therefore, even within the intricate panorama of history, chronology unravels the sequence of events.
