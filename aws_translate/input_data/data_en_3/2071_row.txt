Question: Tom needs to buy a new gaming system. He trades in his super Nintendo for an original NES. The SNES is worth $150 and the store gives him 80% of that value. He gives $80 and gets back $10 change and a game worth $30. How much was the NES on sale for?
Answer: He traded in the SNES for 150 * .8 = $120. Including the money he gave, he spent 120 + 80 = $200. He got 10 + 30 = $40 in change. So the NES cost 200 - 40 = $160. The answer is 160.
[Question]Jennifer is building tanks to hold her goldfish. She built 3 tanks that will hold 15 fish each, heated, and filled them. She plans to build the rest of the tanks equipped with heaters, and they will hold 10 fish each. If she needs to build enough tanks to house a total of 75 fish, how many more will she need to build?
[Answer]With the tanks already built it has room for 3 tanks * 15 fish / tank = 45 fish. The total of fish that still lack space is 75 fish - 45 fish = 30 fish. This means Jennifer needs 30 fish / 10 fish / tank = 3 tanks of 10 fish. The answer is 3.
Q: Ayen jogs for 30 minutes every day during weekdays. This week on Tuesday, she jogged 5 minutes more and also jogged 25 minutes more on Friday. How many hours, in total, did Ayen jog this week?

[Question]Lilith originally had five dozen water bottles that she needed to sell at $2 each to get exactly enough money to buy her friend a birthday gift. However, at the store, Lilith realized she could not sell at $2 because the regular price was $1.85 per water bottle in her town, and she had to reduce her price to $1.85 as well to sell her water bottles. Calculate the total amount of money Lilith will have to find to buy her friend the birthday gift after selling her water bottles at the reduced cost.
[Answer]Lilith had 5 dozen water bottles, and since a dozen has 12 water bottles, the total number of water bottles she had was 12 bottles / dozen * 5 dozen = 60 bottles. To buy her friend the birthday gift, Lilith originally had to sell her water bottles for a total of 60 bottles * $2 / bottle = $120. When she reduced the price to $1.85 to meet the regular price, the total amount of money she had from the sales was $1.85 / bottle * 60 bottles = $111. To buy her friend the birthday gift, Lilith has to find $120 - $111 = $9 more. The answer is 9.
