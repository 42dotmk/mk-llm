Question 1 and Question 2 are closely linked but don't exactly ask the same thing. Question 1 asks for a detailed interpretation or thoughts about the juxtaposition between imaginary time and real time as described by Stephen Hawking, involving an analysis of the differences, similarities, and implications of these two concepts. Question 2, on the other hand, asks for a direct explanation of what Stephen Hawking's concept of imaginary time is.

Stephen Hawking's concept of imaginary time is intriguing and necessitates a deep understanding of theoretical physics and the nature of our universe. To comprehend this concept, we need to delve into the realm of quantum physics and the theory of relativity.

The notion of "Imaginary Time" is derived from quantum mechanics and it is a concept that's used primarily in the modeling of quantum cosmology. Hawking suggested that our conventional understanding of time, which he referred to as "real time," may only be part of the picture. He proposed that "imaginary time" is another dimension of time that runs perpendicular to ordinary or "real" time. It is fundamentally a way of looking at the time dimension at right angles to the conventional or "real" time axis. As such, it doesn't have a start or end; it's cyclical, which resolves some major paradoxes in physics.

Dr. Hawking used these concepts while proposing a model for the universe that has no boundaries—no beginning or end. He believed that if we take the vertical dimension as imaginary time and horizontal dimensions as spatial, this would result in a space-time that's finite in extent but without any boundaries or edges. This is the essence of the Hartle-Hawking state, a proposition about the universe's initial state. 

Imaginary time isn't something one can experience, but it has real effects since it is used to calculate paths of particles. When one states that something happens in imaginary time, they suggest that it happens in a way that's orthogonal to the way we perceive time flowing. 

The major difference between "real time" and "imaginary time" is the sense of direction or arrow of time. Real time has a clear direction – from the past through the present to the future. In contrast, imaginary time does not have a defined direction. For us, it's impossible to perceive imaginary time because we're caught in real time's arrow.

In essence, Hawking's concept of imaginary time is a mathematical device that aids in understanding certain aspects of the universe that are otherwise inexplicable by the standard theories of physics. As such, the concept plays a fundamental role in theories that attempt to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity, where all our notions of classic reality seem to breakdown. Nevertheless, the concept of imaginary time is complex, theoretical, and largely mathematical and doesn't have an effect on our daily lives or our experience of reality. 

To sum up, while both questions invite a discussion of Stephen Hawking's concept of imaginary time, the first one asks for a broader reflection on the comparison between this concept and the idea of real time, while the second one is looking for clarification of what imaginary time actually means.
