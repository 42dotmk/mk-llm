Mahayana Buddhism encourages everyone to become bodhisattvas. This branch of Buddhism is sometimes referred to as the "Greater Vehicle" because of its universal approach and its focus on the well-being of all sentient beings. The bodhisattva ideal is central to its teachings, promoting compassion, wisdom, and altruism. 

In Mahayana Buddhism, a bodhisattva is an individual who seeks to attain complete enlightenment (Buddhahood) for the benefit of themselves and all sentient beings. They make this commitment by taking the bodhisattva vow – a solemn promise to work tirelessly for the complete enlightenment and ultimate liberation of all beings, no matter how long it takes. This contrasts with the path of the Arhat in Theravada Buddhism, where the main goal is to reach individual enlightenment and liberation from the cycle of rebirth (samsara).

The path of the bodhisattva is grounded in the practice of the six pāramitās or perfections. These are essential qualities that the aspirant must cultivate in order to progress on their spiritual journey. 

1. Dāna (Generosity): This encompasses the practice of giving selflessly to others, not only in terms of material possessions but also in terms of time, energy, and emotional support. Cultivating generosity helps to reduce attachment and selfishness, leading to a more open heart and compassionate outlook.

2. Śīla (Moral Conduct): This perfection involves upholding moral precepts and engaging in ethical behavior in all aspects of life. It includes practicing right speech, right action, and right livelihood, which helps to create harmony and peace within oneself and the world.

3. Kṣānti (Patience): Patience is essential for spiritual growth, particularly when faced with difficulties and challenges. It involves developing tolerance and equanimity towards oneself and others, as well as having the ability to accept and endure suffering without becoming bitter or resentful.

4. Vīrya (Energy or Effort): This perfection involves constant diligence and effort in spiritual practice, maintaining enthusiasm and determination even in the face of obstacles. Sustained effort helps prevent laziness and stagnation, ensuring progress along the path.

5. Dhyāna (Meditation or Concentration): Cultivating concentration and mindfulness through meditation practices helps to deepen insight and understanding of the nature of reality. A stable mind allows for the development of profound wisdom and strengthens the other perfections.

6. Prajñā (Wisdom): The ultimate goal of Buddhist practice is to attain wisdom, or the direct understanding of the true nature of reality. This involves developing the right view and understanding of the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the interdependent nature of all phenomena (dependent origination).

By practicing these perfections, bodhisattvas in Mahayana Buddhism gradually transform their minds and overcome the ignorance, craving, and aversion that keep them trapped in the cycle of samsara. This path leads to the complete awakening and enlightenment not only for oneself but for the benefit of all sentient beings, reflecting the compassionate spirit and all-encompassing vision of the Mahayana tradition.
