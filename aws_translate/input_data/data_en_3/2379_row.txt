Question: Liza bought 10 kilograms of butter to make cookies. She used one-half of it for chocolate chip cookies, one-fifth of it for peanut butter cookies, and one-third of the remaining butter for sugar cookies. How many kilograms of butter are left after making those three kinds of cookies?
Answer: Liza used 10 / 2 = 5 kilograms of butter for the chocolate chip cookies. Then, she used 10 / 5 = 2 kilograms of butter for the peanut butter cookies. She used 5 + 2 = 7 kilograms of butter for the chocolate and peanut butter cookies. So, only 10 - 7 = 3 kilograms of butter was left. Then, Liza used 3 / 3 = 1 kilograms of butter for the sugar cookies. Therefore, only 3 - 1 = 2 kilograms of butter were left. The answer is 2.
[Question]In one of the building blocks at Oakland High there are 5 classes. Each class uses 2 whiteboards each and each whiteboard needs about 20ml of ink for a day's use. If ink costs 50 cents per ml, how much (in dollars) would it cost to use the boards for one day?
[Answer]Each ml of ink costs 50 cents so 20 ml costs 20 * 50 = 1000 cents. There are 2 whiteboards in each class so each class needs 2 * 1000 cents = 2000 cents. There are five classes in the block so they all need 5 * 1 * 2000 cents = 10000 cents. 100 cents make a dollar so 10000 cents make 10000 / 100 = $100. The answer is 100.
Q: Lilia has 15 peaches. She sold 10 peaches to her friends for $2 each, while 4 other peaches were sold to her relatives for $1.25 each, and she left the other one for herself. How much did she earn after selling 14 peaches?
A: Lilia earned 10 x $2 = $20 for selling the peaches to her friends. She also earned 4 x $1.25 = $5 for selling the peaches to her relatives. Therefore, Lilia earned $20 + $5 = $25 for selling 14 peaches. The answer is 25.
Question: Tina makes $18.00 an hour. If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage. If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?
Answer: She works 8 hours a day for $18 per hour so she makes 8 * 18 = $144.00 per 8 - hour shift. She works 10 hours a day and anything over 8 hours is eligible for overtime, so she gets 10 - 8 = 2 hours of overtime. Overtime is calculated as time and a half so and she makes $18 / hour so her overtime pay is 18 * .5 = $9.00. Her overtime pay is 18 + 9 = $27.00. Her base pay is $144.00 per 8 - hour shift and she works 5 days and makes 5 * $144 = $720.00. Her overtime pay is $27.00 per hour and she works 2 hours of overtime per day and makes 27 * 2 = $54.00 in overtime pay. 2 hours of overtime pay for 5 days means she makes 54 * 5 = $270.00. In 5 days her base pay is $720.00 and she makes $270.00 in overtime pay so she makes $720 + $270 = $990.00. The answer is 990.
