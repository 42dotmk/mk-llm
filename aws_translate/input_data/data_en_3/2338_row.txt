Q: Erica lives near a lake where most locals sell fish as their main source of income, earning $20 per kg of fish. She goes out fishing today and catches twice as many fish as she caught in total in the past four months. If Erica trawled 80 kg of fish in the past four months, not including today, how much money will she have earned in the past four months including today (assuming she sells all her fish)?
A: In the past four months, not including today, Erica has 80 kg * $20 / kg = $1600 worth of fish. Today, Erica trawled 80 * 2 = 160 kg of fish. Thus today's earnings are 160 kg * $20 / kg = $3200. Her total earnings are $3200 + $1600 = $4800. The answer is 4800.
Question: Two stores sell the same model of smartphone, but they offer it at different prices and with different discounts. Store A lists the smartphone at a full price of $125 and offers an additional discount of 8%. Store B lists the same smartphone for $130 and offers an additional discount of 10%. After both stores' discounts are applied, how much cheaper is store A's smartphone than store B's smartphone?
Answer: Store A has a $125 x 8 / 100 = $10 discount. So the smartphone from store A will only cost $125 - $10 = $115. Store B has a $130 x 10 / 100 = $13 discount. So the smartphone from store B will only cost $130 - $13 = $117. Thus, store A's smartphone is $117 - $115 = $2 cheaper than that of store B. The answer is 2.
[Question]A fixer uses 30% of the nails in a container to repair the kitchen. He also used 70% of the remaining nails in the container to repair the fence. If there were 400 nails in the container, how many nails are remaining?
[Answer]The fixer used 30 / 100 * 400 = 120 nails to fix the kitchen. The number of nails remaining in the container after he fixes the kitchen is 400 - 120 = 280. He also uses 70 / 100 * 280 = 196 of the nails remaining in the container to fix the fence. The total number of nails which the fixer hasn't used is 280 - 196 = 84. The answer is 84.
Q: April went to a concert that has two bands. 2/3 of the audience was there for the second band and 1/3 was there for the first band. 50% of the audience there for the second band is under the age of 30. Of this group, 60% are women and there are 20 men. How many people are at the concert?
A: Of the under - 30s there for the second band, 40% are men because 100 - 60 = 40. There are fifty under - 30s there for the second band because 20 / .4 = 50. There are 100 people there to see the second band because 50 / .5 = 100. There are 150 people at the concert because 100 / (2 / 3) = 150. The answer is 150.
Question: Tony goes on 5 rollercoasters while he is at the park. The first went 50 miles per hour. The second went 62 miles per hour. The third when 73 miles per hour. The fourth when 70 miles per hour. His average speed during the day was 59 miles per hour. How fast was the fifth coaster?
Answer: The total speed of all five coasters is 295 because 59 x 5 = 295. The final coaster went 40 miles per hour because 295 - 50 - 62 - 73 - 70 = 40. The answer is 40.
