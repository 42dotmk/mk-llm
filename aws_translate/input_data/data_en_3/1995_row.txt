Question 1: Who discovered bleaching powder? What was the old process to bleach before its invention?

The Scottish chemist, Charles Tennant, discovered bleaching powder, also known as calcium hypochlorite, in the year 1798. Tennant initially produced the compound by reacting slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) with chlorine gas. The resulting substance, bleaching powder, revolutionized the textile industry due to its superior ability to remove color from fabrics, making the process of bleaching an easier and more efficient undertaking.

Prior to the invention of bleaching powder, the most common method of bleaching fabrics was using a process called "sun-bleaching," which required exposing the materials to direct sunlight for an extended period. This method was both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Additionally, another method called "souring" was used, which involved soaking the fabrics in a diluted solution of lactic or sulfuric acid. Both sun-bleaching and souring were far less efficient than what bleaching powder could offer and came with certain limitations in their effectiveness.

Question 2: How do I bleach my hair without bleach?

Bleaching your hair without using bleach can be done in various ways by using alternative ingredients or methods, although the results might not be as drastic or long-lasting as using a bleach solution. Some of the options to lighten hair without bleach are:

1. Lemon Juice – Lemon juice has natural citric acid which can help lighten hair. Mix equal parts of lemon juice and with water, spray it onto your hair, and comb through to ensure even distribution. Expose your hair to sunlight, and let it sit for 2-3 hours before taking a shower. You might need to repeat this method a few times to see significant lightening.

2. Honey – Honey is a natural lightening agent and also works as a moisturizer, leaving your hair healthy. Mix honey and water (or apple cider vinegar for better results) and apply it to your hair. Leave the mixture for about an hour before washing it out.

3. Cinnamon: Mixing cinnamon with a moisturizing hair conditioner could help lighten your hair. Apply the mixture to your hair, cover with a shower cap, and leave it overnight. Rinse it off in the morning.

4. Apple Cider Vinegar – Apple cider vinegar is known for lightening hair over time. Dilute it with water and use it as a hair rinse after shampooing. This method requires consistent application to notice significant results.

5. Chamomile Tea – Rinsing your hair with chamomile tea can result in a subtle lightening effect. Brew strong chamomile tea, let it cool, and rinse your hair with it after shampooing.

It is important to note that these methods may have varying results depending on your hair type, color, and texture.

Regarding whether questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing: No, these questions are not the same. Question 1 is asking about the discovery of bleaching powder and how fabrics were bleached before its invention. Meanwhile, Question 2 is asking for alternatives to bleach when lightening hair. Although both questions involve the concept of "bleaching," they focus on different subjects, one on the textile industry and the other on hair care.
