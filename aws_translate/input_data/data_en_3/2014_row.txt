[Question]Mr. Callen bought 10 paintings at $40 each and 8 wooden toys at $20 each from the crafts store to resell at a profit. However, when he sold the items, the selling price of a painting was 10% less and the selling price of a hat 15% less. Calculate the total loss Mr. Callen made from the sale of the items.
[Answer]If he sold a painting at a 10% loss, then he made a 10 / 100 * $40 = $4 loss on each painting. since he bought 10 paintings, the total loss he made from selling the paintings is 10 * $4 = $40. He also made a loss of 15 / 100 * 20 = $3 loss from selling each wooden toy. Since he bought 8 wooden toys, the total loss he made was 3 * 8 = $24. In total, Mr. Callen made a loss of $40 + $24 = $64 from the sales of the items. The answer is 64.
Q: Leah earned $28 working odd jobs around the neighborhood. She spent a seventh of it on a milkshake and put half of the rest in her savings account. She left the remaining money in her wallet. Her dog got ahold of her wallet and shredded all the money inside but $1. How many dollars did Leah lose?
A: Leah spent 28 / 7 = $4 on a milkshake. She had 28 - 4 = $24 left. She put half in her savings account and half in her wallet, so she had 24 / 2 = $12 in her wallet. Her dog shredded all the money in her wallet but $1, so Leah lost 12 - 1 = $11. The answer is 11.
Question: Ian won $100 in the lottery. He decided to use the money to pay off debts. He paid $20 to Colin. He then paid twice as much to Helen, as he had paid to Colin. Then finally, he paid half as much to Benedict, as he had paid to Helen. How much money, in dollars, does he have left after paying off debts?
Answer: Starting with $100, he paid $20 to Colin, leaving him with $100 - $20 = $80. Twice as much as $20 is 2 * $20 = $40. Thus, he paid $40 to Helen, leaving him with $80 - $40 = $40. Half as much to Benedict as he had paid to Helen is $40 / 2 = $20. Thus, he paid $20 to Benedict, leaving him with $40 - $20 = $20 after paying off all debts. The answer is 20.

Q: 40% of the mosquitos in Jack's area are infected with malaria. 20% of the mosquitos are infected with Zika virus. Without a vaccine, the chances of getting infected with either virus after getting bitten by an infected mosquito are 50%. Jack is taking an experimental malaria vaccine that reduces the chances of getting infected after getting bitten by 50%. If Jack gets bitten by a random mosquito, what is the percentage chance he catches either Zika virus or malaria?
A: First find Jack's chances of getting bitten by an infected mosquito: 40% + 20% = 60%. The chance of being infected by a mosquito with after being bitten: 60% * 50% = 30%. Then find the chances of getting ill after receiving the vaccine: 30% * 50% = 15%. The answer is 15.
