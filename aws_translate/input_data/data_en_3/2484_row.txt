For months after the show's airing, the Foden couple could not shake the feeling of being unfairly judged by their fellow competitors. Their sleek, modern, and tech-savvy home, designed around the iconic James Bond theme, was certainly a cut above the rest. However, they couldn't shake the nagging feeling that there was more to the judging than met the eye.

For weeks, the Fodens analyzed the episodes that preceded theirs and found a pattern. In each episode, a specific couple would give extremely low scores to their competitors, resulting in the couple becoming the show's victors. These findings fueled Lisa and Robert's search for the truth. They decided that the only way to clear their conscience and expose the accused couple's alleged tactics was to show their proof to the show's producers.

Gathering their evidence in the form of a detailed table and chart, Lisa and Robert brought their concerns to the attention of the producers via a formal letter. In the letter, they laid out the patterns they discovered and explained that the alleged manipulative ratings were the reason their own home did not win the prize. The couple also politely requested a revision of their episode's scores to ensure a fairer outcome.

Following the Fodens' revelations, the Channel 4 producers decided to investigate the matter further, comparing the scores over other episodes where the accused couple resided. Although there was hesitation in making a final decision due to the subjective nature of judging homes, the compelling evidence provided by the Fodens led to the show's producers taking swift action.

To make amends for the alleged foul play, the May The Best House Win production team decided to combine the scores of the Foden's house against a different set of episodes, resulting in a more fair comparison. After a complete reassessment of the scores, the Fodens' Bond-themed home was declared the new grand winner of the show, and they were finally awarded the sought-after Â£1,000 prize.

The Channel 4 team reached out to the Foden couple, who expressed their gratitude for the fairer outcome. The show's producers ensured that future episodes would be closely monitored to prevent manipulative scoring tactics from affecting the overall results. The couple featured in the original winning episode was barred from participating in future shows, and their victory was stripped from the record.

In the weeks that followed, the story unfolded in the media, gaining widespread public attention. The show saw a surge in viewership as the audiences became curious about the result of the Fodens' tireless pursuit of fairness. Out of controversy came growth, and Channel 4 vowed to enhance their show's integrity and maintain the original lighthearted spirit of friendly competition.

For the Fodens, their efforts did more than just secure victory. Their dedication to fairness transformed a potentially negative experience into a lesson in perseverance and advocating for justice in a seemingly innocent TV show. Ultimately, their actions reshaped the rules of May The Best House Win and served as an important reminder to always stand up for what is right, even when it comes to the less critical, but equally as meaningful aspects of life.
