Q: A bathroom has 10 6 inch tiles along its width and 20 6 inch tiles along its length. What is the square footage of the bathroom?
A: There are 10 tiles that are 6 inches long running the width of the bathroom so it is 10 * 6 = 60 inches long. There are 12 inches in a foot and it’s 60 inches wide so it is 60 / 12 = 5 feet wide. There are 20 tiles that are 6 inches long running the length of the bathroom so it’s 20 * 6 = 120 inches long. There are 12 inches in a foot and it’s 120 inches long so it is 120 / 12 = 10 feet wide. The square footage is l x w so the bathroom has 10 * 5 = 50 sq feet. The answer is 50.
Question: Yeon has three times as many watermelon seeds as Gwi. Gwi has 40 more watermelon seeds than Bom. If Bom has 300 watermelon seeds, how many seeds do they have together?
Answer: If Bom has 300 seeds, then Gwi has 300 + 40 = 340 watermelon seeds. Together, Bom and Gwi have 340 + 300 = 640 melon seeds. Yeon's number of watermelon seeds is three times as many as the number that Gwi has, meaning Yeon has 3 * 340 = 1020 watermelon seeds. Together, the three friends have 1020 + 640 = 1660 watermelon seeds. The answer is 1660.
[Question]Each bird eats 12 beetles per day, each snake eats 3 birds per day, and each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. If there are 6 jaguars in a forest, how many beetles are eaten each day?
[Answer]First find the total number of snakes eaten: 5 snakes / jaguar * 6 jaguars = 30 snakes. Then find the total number of birds eaten per day: 30 snakes * 3 birds / snake = 90 snakes. Then multiply the number of snakes by the number of beetles per snake to find the total number of beetles eaten per day: 90 snakes * 12 beetles / snake = 1080 beetles. The answer is 1080.
Q: Daniel owns a textile company. Every Monday he delivers 20 yards of fabric, and every Tuesday he delivers twice the amount of fabric he delivers on Monday. Every Wednesday, he delivers 1/4 of the amount of fabric he delivers on Tuesday. If each yard of fabric costs $2 and each yard of yarn costs $3, how much does he earn from Monday to Wednesday?
A: Every Tuesday, Daniel delivers 20 x 2 = 40 yards of fabric. Every Wednesday, he delivers 40 x 1 / 4 = 10 yards of fabric. Thus, he delivers a total of 20 + 40 + 10 = 70 yards of fabric from Monday to Wednesday. Therefore, Daniel earns $2 x 70 = $140 from it. The answer is 140.
Question: Jonas is a book collector. He has so many books he is converting his third bedroom into a library. This room has 400 square feet of space. He plans to put several bookshelves in the room and each bookshelf takes up 80 square feet of space. If he reserves 160 square feet of space to use for a desk and some walking space, how many shelves can he put in the room?
Answer: If he reserves 160 sq. ft. of space for a desk and some walking space, then he will have 400 - 160 = 240 sq. ft. of space remaining. If each bookshelf takes up 80 sq. ft. of space, then 240 sq ft can contain 240 / 80 = 3 bookshelves. The answer is 3.
