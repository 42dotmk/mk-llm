The two questions are similar but not exactly the same. The first question asks if one should marry a girl who had a boyfriend in the past, and the second question asks if one should marry a girl who has been in a relationship. While both questions address the issue of a girl's previous relationship experience, the second question is broader since it generalizes about any past relationship, which could include boyfriends, girlfriends, or any other type of romantic or intimate connection.

Evaluating whether to marry a person based on their past relationships could be a subjective decision that depends on individual values and beliefs. However, it's important to remember that evaluating a potential spouse should be based on various factors regarding the person's character and compatibility with oneself rather than merely focusing on their past relationships. Here are a few essential aspects to consider:

1. Compatibility: Assess if you and your potential spouse share similar values, beliefs, and interests, and if you both enjoy each other's company. A relationship built on compatibility forms a stronger foundation for marriage than a person's past relationship history.

2. Trust: Establishing trust is of utmost importance in any relationship. If you find it challenging to trust the person because of their past relationships, you should evaluate whether the issue stems from an insecurity within you or the person's behavior in the present context. If they have moved on from their past, learned from those experiences, and have demonstrated trustworthiness since then, it may not be fair to judge them solely based on the past.

3. Emotional baggage: People who have had past relationships might carry some emotional baggage, but it is essential to remember that everyone has a past, and we all have made mistakes and grown from them. The key is to understand whether the person has come to terms with their past, overcome any emotional baggage, and is ready to commit to a new chapter in life with you.

4. Personal growth: It is vital to consider whether the person has grown as an individual since their past relationships. If they have learned from their experiences, matured emotionally and mentally, and made positive changes, it is not fair to penalize them for a past relationship. 

5. Communication: Open and honest communication is a pillar of any successful relationship. If concerns about the person's past relationships arise, it is crucial to have a mature and non-judgmental conversation about it. Understand the context of their past, what they learned from it, and ensure that both parties are genuinely committed to moving forward together.

In conclusion, marrying someone who has had a previous relationship or a boyfriend/girlfriend in the past should not be a deal-breaker. Instead, focus on other essential aspects such as compatibility, trust, emotional baggage, personal growth, and communication. Remember, it is the present and the future that matter the most when building a life together, and a person's past relationships should not overshadow the potential for a successful and fulfilling marriage if they have genuinely evolved and grown from their experiences.
