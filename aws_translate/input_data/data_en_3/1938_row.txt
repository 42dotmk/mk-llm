Following a long period of investigations pursuing the primary cause of the abrupt accident that claimed the lives of Hollywood actor Paul Walker and professional race car driver Roger Rodas in 2013, official confirmation has emerged that unsafe driving was solely to blame. There have been numerous theories and speculations circulating around, suggesting that a mechanical malfunction in the Porsche Carrera GT or poor roadway conditions may have played a significant part in the tragic incident. However, authorities have finally ruled out these assumptions, clarifying that the high-speed driving was the principal factor leading to the fatal crash.

As reported by a spokesperson from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, the Carrera GT, driven by Rodas, was travelling at an astounding speed of between 80mph and 93mph when he tragically lost control of the vehicle. This high-speed pursuit took place in an area demarcated as a 45mph zone, indicating that the vehicle was moving at almost double the speed limit when the crash occurred. This speed reckoning is alarming and underscores the brutality of the crash, as it depicts a glaring disregard for traffic rules and the safety measures associated with them.

Another relevant assertion made by the spokesperson, as relayed by NBC Los Angeles, was that neither Walker nor Rodas were under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the accident. This essentially debunks another line of speculation suggesting substance abuse as a potential factor behind the fatal incident. It also further reinforces the assertion that the main culpability lies with the reckless, high-speed driving.

Both Walker and Rodas were also found to be adhering to standard safety measures at the time of the incident. They were both wearing seatbelts, and the vehicle's airbags were reported to have functioned as they were supposed to, deploying normally upon impact.

Investigators also turned their attention to the Porsche Carrera GT's mechanical condition. The car's exhaust system had been modified in a manner that would allow it to reach higher speeds. This modification suggests the possibility of deliberate attempts to facilitate high-speed driving. Furthermore, it was noted that the Carrera GT was equipped with tires that were nine years oldâ€”five years beyond the period recommended for a change in the owner's manual.

It is important to note, nonetheless, that CNN reported that the vehicle was primarily displayed, barely driven, which could justify the outdated tires. Additionally, the vehicle's left rear brake rotor was found to be in a degenerated condition wherein it fell below the manufacturer's specifications. However, investigators determined that this deficiency did not contribute to the crash.

Lastly, there was speculation that Rodas might have been in a race with another vehicle at the time of the crash. But investigators found no substantial evidence validating this theory. Despite various angles of speculation and examination of different potential causes, the investigators have, in conclusion, firmly imputed the high-speed driving as the single-handed reason behind the tragic accident that led to the loss of two lives.
