Question: In 10 years, Cornelia will be three times as old as Kilee. If Kilee is currently 20 years old, how old is Cornelia now?
Answer: In 10 years, Kilee will be 20 years + 10 years = 30 years. In ten years, Cornelia will be 3 * 30 years = 90 years old. Cornelia is currently 90 years - 10 years = 80 years old. The answer is 80.
[Question]What is the average age of the 1st and 5th fastest dogs if the 1st fastest dog is 10 years old, the 2nd fastest dog is 2 years younger than the first fastest dog, the 3rd fastest dog is 4 years older than the 2nd fastest dog, the 4th fastest dog is half the age of the 3rd fastest dog, and the 5th fastest dog is 20 years older than the 4th fastest dog?
[Answer]If the 1st fastest dog is 10 years old, and the 2nd fastest dog is 2 years younger than the first fastest dog, the 2nd fastest dog is 10 - 2 = 8 years old. The 3rd fastest dog being 4 years older than the 2nd fastest dog, is 8 + 4 = 12 years old. The 4th fastest dog is half the age of the 3rd fastest dog, meaning the 4th fastest dog is 1 / 2 * 12 = 6 years old. The 5th fastest dog is 20 years older than the 4th fastest dog, meaning the 5th fastest dog is 6 + 20 = 26 years old. The total age of the 1st and 5th fastest dogs is 26 + 10 = 36 years. The average age of the 1st and 5th fastest dogs is 36 / 2 = 18 years old. The answer is 18.
Q: Darryl sells melons on the side of the road. He sells cantaloupes for $2 each and honeydews for $3. He started the day with 30 cantaloupes and 27 honeydews. He accidentally dropped a couple of cantaloupes and three of the honeydews turned out to be rotten. At the end of the day he had 8 cantaloupes and 9 honeydews left. How much money did he make?
A: He dropped two cantaloupes and had 8 left over at the end of the day, so he sold 30 - 2 - 8 = 20 cantaloupes. Three honeydews were rotten, and he had 9 left at the end of the day, so he sold 27 - 3 - 9 = 15 honeydews. He sold 20 cantaloupes * $2 / cantaloupe = $40 in cantaloupes. He also sold 15 honeydews * $3 / honeydew = $45 in honeydews. Altogether he made $40 + $45 = $85. The answer is 85.

[Question]Some friends went hiking for 3.5 hours. They traveled 21 kilometers in that time. Birgit was 4 minutes/km faster than the average time. If Birgit kept the same pace, how many minutes would it take her to go 8 kilometers?
[Answer]Minutes spent hiking = 3.5 * 60 = 210 minutes. Average speed = 210 minutes / 21 km = 10 minutes / km. Birgit is 4 minutes / km faster = 10 - 4 = 6 min / km. It would take 6 * 8 = 48 minutes to go 8 km. Birgit would take 48 minutes to travel 8 kilometers. The answer is 48.
