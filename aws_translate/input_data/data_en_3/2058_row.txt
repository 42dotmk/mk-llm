Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a prestigious annual program that provides students and enthusiasts with an opportunity to work on open-source projects under the guidance of dedicated mentors. Participating in GSoC increases your chances of honing your programming and collaborative skills and, consequently, makes you attractive to future employers. To increase your chances of getting selected for Google Summer of Code, follow these steps:

1. Begin early:
Start well before the GSoC application period begins. This will give you ample time to research projects, hone your skills and create an impressive proposal.

2. Choose the right project:
Select a project that aligns with your skills and interests. Study the project's requirements and its codebase to understand the tools and technologies used. You'll have to work on this project for an extended period, so ensure it keeps you engaged during the entire program.

3. Build your skills:
In addition to understanding the technology stack needed for your chosen project, familiarize yourself with version control tools like Git and issue tracking systems. Extensive knowledge of programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript will be valuable, depending on the project requirements. Learning additional tools, libraries, and frameworks can also improve your prospects for selection.

4. Engage with the community:
Join the project's mailing lists, IRC channels, forums, or Slack groups and start participating in discussions. Engaging with the community helps you better understand the project scope, expectations, and the available resources, including potential mentors.

5. Contribute to the project:
Make small contributions to the project by fixing bugs, adding minor features, or improving documentation. This not only showcases your skills but also demonstrates your commitment. Maintaining a good working relationship with the project maintainers and potential mentors boosts your chances of selection.

6. Build a strong proposal:
Create a detailed and well-structured proposal that outlines your understanding of the project, proposed solutions, implementation plan, and timeline. A compelling proposal should demonstrate your ability to dissect the problem, design a solution, and achieve the project goals within a stipulated time. Be concise but specific in explaining your approach to solving the problem.

7. Ask for feedback:
Share your proposal draft with the community and ask for feedback. Their critique will help refine your proposal and increase the probability of selection.

8. Prepare for the interview:
If shortlisted, you may have to participate in an interview with the potential mentors. Familiarize yourself with commonly asked questions and be prepared to answer project-specific queries.

9. Stay committed:
Even if you are not selected for GSoC, continue participating in the open-source community and contribute to the projects that interest you. This will provide you with valuable experience and improve your chances of selection in future rounds.

To answer the second part of your question, both questions essentially convey the same meaning, which is how to secure a place in the Google Summer of Code program.
