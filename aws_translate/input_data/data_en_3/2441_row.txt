Question: Mary is paying her monthly garbage bill for a month with exactly four weeks. The garbage company charges Mary $10 per trash bin and $5 per recycling bin every week, and Mary has 2 trash bins and 1 recycling bin. They're giving her an 18% discount on the whole bill before fines for being elderly, but also charging her a $20 fine for putting inappropriate items in a recycling bin. How much is Mary's garbage bill?
Answer: First find how much Mary pays weekly for the trash bins: $10 / trash bin * 2 trash bins = $20. Then add this to the cost of the recycling bin: $20 + $5 = $25. Then multiply the week cost by the number of weeks per month to find the monthly cost: $25 / week * 4 weeks / month = $100 / month. Now calculate Mary's senior discount: 18% * $100 = $18. Now subtract the discount and add the fine to find the total monthly cost: $100 - $18 + $20 = $102. The answer is 102.
[Question]Mark plants some strawberries in his backyard. Every month, the number of strawberry plants doubles. After 3 months, Mark digs up 4 strawberry plants and gives them to his friend. If he still has 20 strawberry plants, how many did he initially plant?
[Answer]First, add the 4 plants Mark gave away to the 20 he has left: 4 + 20 = 24. Then divide this number by 2 to find how many plants Mark had after two months: 24 / 2 = 12. Then divide that number by 2 to find how many plants Mark had after one month: 12 / 2 = 6. Finally, divide that number by 2 to find out how many plants Mark initially planted: 6 / 2 = 3. The answer is 3.
Q: Manny is making lasagna for dinner with his four friends, Lisa, Raphael, Aaron, and Kai. He needs to know how many pieces to cut the lasagna into to serve it. Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?
A: Manny will eat 1 piece. Aaron will eat 0 pieces. Kai will eat twice as much as Manny, so he will eat 2 * 1 = 2 pieces. Raphael will eat half as much as Manny, so he will eat 1 * 1 / 2 = 1 / 2 piece. Lisa will eat 2 pieces plus the remainder of Raphaelâ€™s piece, so she will eat 2 + 1 / 2 = 2 1 / 2 pieces. Together, they will eat 1 + 0 + 2 + 1 / 2 + 2 1 / 2 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 pieces. Thus, Manny should cut his lasagna into 6 pieces. The answer is 6.
