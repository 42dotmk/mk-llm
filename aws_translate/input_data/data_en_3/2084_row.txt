You are correct in choosing "encyclopedia" as the best source to look up information about a sloth. Below, I will provide a detailed explanation as to why an encyclopedia is the most appropriate choice from the given options and why the other alternatives are not as suitable for this purpose.

1. Encyclopedia: Encyclopedias are comprehensive, organized collections of information on a broad range of subjects. They are designed to provide detailed, reliable, and up-to-date information that can help users gain a solid understanding of various topics. Since sloths are a specific animal species that fall under the category of biological science, utilizing an encyclopedia would be the most effective and accurate way to obtain information about them. Encyclopedias often include both general knowledge about sloths - such as their appearance, habitat, diet, and behavior - as well as more specialized information on their anatomy, biology, and conservation status.

2. Wilderness: This option refers to a natural environment that has not been significantly altered or influenced by human activity. While it is true that sloths can be found in their natural habitat - which may be classified as the wilderness - this is not a type of written material that can be consulted to learn about these animals. To study sloths in the wilderness, one would have to engage in field research activities such as observations and data collection, which is a completely different method that does not involve consulting written resources.

3. Magazine: Magazines are periodical publications that typically focus on a specific subject or theme. Some magazines may feature articles about sloths; however, these publications are unlikely to provide the depth of information required for a comprehensive understanding of this species. Moreover, content published in magazines is usually less authoritative and less subject to rigorous peer review than that found in encyclopedias, thus making the information found in magazines potentially less accurate.

4. Commercial: This term generally pertains to business and trade activities, including advertising and promotion of products or services. It is not related to written works or informational resources, and as such, would not be a relevant answer to the question in the context provided.

5. Countryside: The term "countryside" refers to the land and scenery of rural areas, which are typically characterized by farms, small towns, and natural landscapes. While it is possible that sloths might be mentioned or discussed in written materials about the countryside (particularly if it pertains to areas where they are native, such as Central and South America), the term itself does not directly refer to a collection of writings or a specific text where one would expect to find comprehensive information about these animals.

In conclusion, given the available choices, an encyclopedia is the most appropriate and reliable resource if you want to look up detailed information about a sloth. Encyclopedias provide comprehensive, accurate, and well-organized information on a wide range of subjects, making them the ideal choice for gaining a thorough understanding of the topic at hand.
