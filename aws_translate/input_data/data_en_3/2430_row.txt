[Question]Enrique has 2 132 contracts that he needs to shred. His paper shredder will only allow him to shred 6 pages at a time. How many times will he shred 6 units of paper until all of the contracts are shredded?
[Answer]He has 2 contracts that are 132 pages each so that's 2 * 132 = 264 pages. He can only shred 6 pages at a time so it will take him 264 / 6 = 44 units. The answer is 44.
Q: Phill had some friends over for pizza. He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced. Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again. Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends. How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
A: Phill starts with 1 pizza, cutting it in half. This means he now has 1 * 2 = 2 slices of pizza. He cuts each of these 2 slices in half, meaning he now has 2 * 2 = 4 slices of pizza. He then cuts these in half again, meaning he now has 4 * 2 = 8 slices of pizza. Phill hands out 2 slices to 2 of his friends, meaning he gave out 2 * 2 = 4 slices. He hands out 1 slice to 3 others, so the total amount of slices handed out are 3 + 4 = 7 slices. Since Phill started with 8 slices, this means he has 8 - 7 = 1 slice remaining. The answer is 1.
Question: Lucas' father offers to pay him $2 for each window in the house that he cleans. Each floor of Lucas' house has 3 windows; Lucas lives in a 3-story house. To get Lucas to finish the job faster, his father tells him that he will subtract $1 for every 3 days that pass without Lucas finishing the job. In 6 days, Lucas finishes cleaning all the windows in the house. How much will his father pay him, in dollars?
Answer: Lucas cleans a total of 3 floors * 3 windows / floor = 9 windows. The windows cleaned earn Lucas 2 dollars each, so Lucas earns 9 windows * $2 / window = $18. For taking 6 days to clean, Lucas' father subtracts 6 days / $3 / day = $2. In total, Lucas' father will pay him $18 - $2 = $16. The answer is 16.
[Question]Courtney liked to collect marbles. She kept them in mason jars. One jar had 80 marbles. Her second jar had twice that amount. She just started her third jar which currently has 1/4 the amount of her first jar. How many marbles does she have in total?
[Answer]One jar had 80 and the second jar had twice that amount so 2 * 80 = 160 marbles. The third jar had 1 / 4 of the first jar's 80 marbles so it had .25 * 80 = 20 marbles. When you add up all the jars, she had 80 + 160 + 20 = 260 marbles. The answer is 260.
Q: Melody needs to read 20 pages for her English class, 16 pages for her Science class, 8 pages for her Civics, and 12 pages for Chinese class. She decided to read one-fourth of the number of pages for each class tomorrow. How many pages will she read tomorrow?
A: She will read 20 pages / 4 = 5 pages for English. She will read 16 pages / 4 = 4 pages for Science. She will read 8 pages / 4 = 2 pages for Civics. She will read 12 pages / 4 = 3 pages for Chinese. Melody will read a total of 5 pages + 4 pages + 2 pages + 3 pages = 14 pages tomorrow. The answer is 14.
