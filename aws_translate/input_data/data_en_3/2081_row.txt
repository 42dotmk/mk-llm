Question: Jeff decides to install more cabinets in his kitchen. He currently has 3 cabinets over one counter and no other cabinets. He installs twice as many cabinets over 3 different counters each. He then installs 5 more cabinets. How many total cabinets does he have?
Answer: He installs 3 * 2 = 6 cabinets over each counter. So he installs 6 * 3 = 18 cabinets over counters. That means he installed a total of 18 + 5 = 23 cabinets. So he has 23 + 3 = 26 cabinets. The answer is 26.
[Question]Every 10 seconds, there is a car collision, and every 20 seconds there is a big crash. How many accidents overall will happen in 4 minutes?
[Answer]1 minute is 60 seconds, so 4 minutes is 4 * 60 = 240 seconds. During this time there would be 240 / 20 = 12 big crashes. And also 240 / 10 = 24 car collisions. So in total during 4 minutes there would be 12 + 24 = 36 accidents. The answer is 36.
Q: Out of the 200 cookies that Javier baked from the recipe he learned online, his wife took 30%, and his daughter took 40 from the remaining cookies. If he ate half of the remaining cookies, how many cookies did they not eat?
A: From the 200 cookies, Javier's wife ate 30 / 100 * 200 = 60. After the wife ate 60 cookies, the number of cookies that remained was 200 - 60 = 140. The daughter also ate 40 cookies leaving 140 - 40 = 100 cookies. If Javier ate half of the remaining cookies, he ate 1 / 2 * 100 = 50. The number of cookies that remained is 100 - 50 = 50. The answer is 50.
Question: Village Foods sells good food at a fair price. Their specialty is fresh vegetables. If they get 500 customers per month, and each customer purchases 2 heads of lettuce for $1 each and 4 tomatoes for $0.5 apiece, then how much money, in dollars, will the store receive in sales of lettuce and tomatoes per month?
Answer: 2 heads of lettuce at $1 apiece is 2 * $1 = $2. 4 tomatoes at $0.50 apiece is 4 * $0.5 = $2. Thus, each customer purchases $2 + $2 = $4 in lettuce and tomatoes per month. Therefore, if 500 customers per month spend $4 on lettuce and tomatoes, then the store will receive $4 * 500 = $2000 per month on sales of lettuce and tomatoes. The answer is 2000.
