Q: On his calculator, August had solved a math problem with an answer of 600. The following math problem had an answer twice as big as the answer of the first math problem, and the third math problem had an answer 400 less than the combined total answers of the first and the second math problems. What's the total of August's answers from solving the three math problems on his calculator?
A: August solved a math problem that had an answer twice as big as the answer of the first math problem, meaning the next answer was 600 * 2 = 1200. The first math problem and the second math problem has answers totaling 1200 + 600 = 1800. The third math problem had an answer 400 less than the combined total answers of the first and the second math problems, meaning the third answer was 1800 - 400 = 1400. Altogether, the math problems that August solved on his computer had answers totaling 1800 + 1400 = 3200. The answer is 3200.
Question: Ivan has a bird feeder in his yard that holds two cups of birdseed. Every week, he has to refill the emptied feeder. Each cup of birdseed can feed fourteen birds, but Ivan is constantly chasing away a hungry squirrel that steals half a cup of birdseed from the feeder every week. How many birds does Ivan’s bird feeder feed weekly?
Answer: The squirrel steals 1 / 2 cup of birdseed every week, so the birds eat 2 - 1 / 2 = 1 1 / 2 cups of birdseed. Each cup feeds 14 birds, so Ivan’s bird feeder feeds 14 * 1 1 / 2 = 21 birds weekly. The answer is 21.

Question: James has a small tree outside his window with 30 branches with 90 twigs per branch. 30% of the twigs sprout 4 leaves and the rest sprout 5 leaves. How many leaves are on the tree total?
Answer: First find the total number of twigs on the tree: 30 branches * 90 twigs / branch = 2700 twigs. Then multiply that number by 30% to find how many twigs have 4 leaves: 2700 twigs * 30% = 810 twigs. Then subtract that number from the total number of twigs to find how many have 5 leaves: 2700 twigs - 810 twigs = 1890 twigs. Then multiply that number by 5 to find the number of leaves on the 5 - leaved twigs: 1890 twigs * 5 leaves / twig = 9450 leaves. Then multiply the number of 4 - leaved twigs by 4 to find the total number of leaves they have: 810 twigs * 4 leaves / twig = 3240 leaves. Then add the two groups of leaves to find the total number of leaves: 9450 leaves + 3240 leaves = 12690 leaves. The answer is 12690.
