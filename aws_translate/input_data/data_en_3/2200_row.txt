Question: Cowboy Mickey and cowgirl Minnie train horses for a living. On average, Mickey mounts six less than twice as many horses per day as does Minnie, while Minnie mounts three more horses per day than there are days in a week. How many horses does Mickey Mount per week?
Answer: If Minnie mounts three more horses per day than there are days in a week, then Minnie mounts 7 + 3 = 10 horses per day. Twice as many horses per day as Minnie mounts is 10 * 2 = 20 horses per day. If Mickey mounts six less than twice as many horses per day as does Minnie, then Mickey mounts 20 - 6 = 14 horses per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, then Mickey mounts 7 * 14 = 98 horses per week. The answer is 98.
[Question]Bill milked his cow and got 16 gallons of milk. He turned 1/4 into sour cream, 1/4 into butter, and kept the rest as whole milk. It takes 4 gallons of milk to make one gallon of butter and 2 gallons of milk to make 1 gallon of sour cream. If Bill sells butter for $5/gallon, sour cream for $6/gallon, and whole milk for $3/gallon, how much money does he make?
[Answer]First find how much milk Bill turned into sour cream and butter: 16 gallons * 1 / 4 = 4 gallons. Then find how many gallons of butter he makes out of 4 gallons of milk: 4 gallons milk / 4 gallons milk / 1 gallon butter = 1 gallon butter. Then find how many gallons of sour cream he makes out of 4 gallons of milk: 4 gallons milk / 2 gallons milk / 1 gallon sour cream = 2 gallon sour cream. Then subtract the amount of milk turned into butter and sour cream to find the remaining amount of whole milk: 16 gallons - 4 gallons - 4 gallons = 8 gallons. Then multiply the number of gallons of milk by the price of milk to find the total cost of the milk: 8 gallons * $3 / gallon = $24. Then multiply the number of gallons of sour cream by the price of sour cream to find the total cost of the sour cream: 2 gallons * $6 / gallon = $12. Then add the cost of the butter, sour cream and milk to find the total amount of money Bill earns: $24 + $12 + $5 = $41. The answer is 41.
