Act 1:
- Introduce Frank, an experienced courier who's known for his steadfast reliability and desire to stay out of trouble. He lives a quiet, solitary life and has a strict moral code: he never asks questions about the packages he's hired to deliver.
- Frank gets a lucrative offer from a secretive and wealthy client to make a highly confidential delivery to a high-ranking Wall Street executive, Mr. Richardson.
- Although Frank is initially hesitant to accept the job due to the client's enigmatic demeanor, he relents due to the significant sum of money offered and a need to resolve some personal financial issues.

Act 2:
- Frank sets off to make the delivery, navigating through New York City and its busy streets. As he gets closer to Wall Street, he notices that he is being followed by a group of mysterious and highly-skilled individuals.
- Frank, using his street-smarts and expert courier skills, shakes off his pursuers and manages to reach Mr. Richardson's office successfully. However, upon entering, he finds Mr. Richardson dead on the floor.
- Startled and fearing for his life, Frank examines the package and discovers it contains incriminating evidence of insider trading and corruption involving many of Wall Street's most powerful players, including figures within the government agencies.
- Realizing the importance of the package and the danger he's in, Frank decides he cannot simply walk away. He decides to secure the evidence somewhere, vowing to reveal the truth and bring justice to those involved.

Act 3:
- Frank teams up with Emily, an ambitious journalist who is determined to expose the Wall Street corruption. Together, they use their combined skills to unravel the conspiracy while dodging assassins and law enforcement agents working on behalf of the corrupt individuals.
- During their investigation, Frank and Emily discover that the mysterious figures following Frank are part of a powerful and dangerous secret organization with ties to both the government and the financial sector.
