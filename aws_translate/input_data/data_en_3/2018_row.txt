[Question]Bret and a team of 3 co-workers were working late so he ordered dinner for everyone. They decided on Chinese. Each main meal costs $12.0. They also ordered 2 appetizers that were $6.00 each. He includes a 20% tip and an extra $5.00 to make it a rush order. How much does Bret spend on dinner?
[Answer]There are 4 co - workers and each of their meals is $12.00 so 4 * 12 = $48.00. They order 2 appetizers at $6.00 each so 2 * 6 = $12.00. The meals costs $48.00 and the appetizers costs $12.00 for a total of 48 + 12 = $60.00. A 20% tip on the $60.00 order is .20 * 60 = $12.00. So the meal is $60.00, the tip is $12.00 and he adds a $5.00 rush for a total of 60 + 12 + 5 = $77.00. The answer is 77.

Question: In North Carolina, Jim bought 10 gallons of gas at $2.00/gallon. He paid $1.00 more per gallon in Virginia where he bought another 10 gallons of gas. How much has he spent on gas?
Answer: In North Carolina, he bought 10 gallons at $2.00 / gallon for a total of 10 * 2 = $20.00.

He spent $20.00 in North Carolina and $30.00 in Virginia for total of 20 + 30 = $50.00. The answer is 50.
[Question]A teacher is making packed lunches for a field trip. Each student needs 2 sandwiches, and will travel in a group with 5 other students. There are a total of 5 groups. How many pieces of bread will the teacher need to make enough sandwiches for all the students?
[Answer]If each student travels with 5 others, then groups are made up of 5 + 1 = 6 students. This means there are a total of 5 groups * 6 students = 30 students in the class. Each student needs 2 sandwiches, which means the teacher will make 30 students * 2 sandwiches per student = 60 sandwiches in total. Therefore, the teachers will need 60 sandwiches * 2 pieces of bread per sandwich = 120 pieces of bread. The answer is 120.
