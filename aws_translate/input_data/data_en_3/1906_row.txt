[Question]Nikka has a 100 stamp collection. Thirty-five percent of her stamps are Chinese, 20% are US stamps, and the rest are Japanese stamps. How many Japanese stamps does Nikka have?
[Answer]Nikka has 100 x 35 / 100 = 35 Chinese stamps. She has 100 x 20 / 100 = 20 US stamps. So, Nikka has 35 + 20 = 55 stamps that are not Japanese. Thus, Nikka has 100 - 55 = 45 Japanese stamps. The answer is 45.
Q: Ethyl bought Lucy two new dolls for her doll collection. This increased the doll collection by 25%. After the addition of the two new dolls, how many dolls are in Lucy's collection?
A: Let's let "x" be the original number of dolls in Lucy's doll collection. Then, 2 dolls equals an increase of 25%, and this can be written as x * 0.25 = 2. Solving for x we get x = 2 / 0.25 = 8 dolls in Lucy's original collection. After the gift of two new dolls, Lucy's collection contains 8 + 2 = 10 dolls. The answer is 10.
Question: A houseâ€™s living room, dining room and kitchen take up 1,000 sq ft. The house also has a guest bedroom and a master bedroom suite. If the guest bedroom is a quarter of the size of the master bedroom suite, and the house is 2,300 sq ft total, how large is the master bedroom suite?
Answer: The house is 2,300 sq ft and we know the non - bedroom sections take up 1,000 sq ft, so that leaves 2300 - 1000 = 1,300 sq ft for the bedrooms / bathrooms. Let x be the size of the master bedroom suite. Then the guest bedroom is 0.25x. So together the bedrooms are x + 0.25x = 1.25x in size. This means 1.25x = 1300. So x = 1300 / 1.25 = 1040 sq ft. The answer is 1040.

Q: After complaints from the residents of Tatoosh about the number of cats on the island, the wildlife service carried out a relocation mission that saw the number of cats on the island drastically reduced. On the first relocation mission, 600 cats were relocated from the island to a neighboring island. On the second mission, half of the remaining cats were relocated to a rescue center inland. If the number of cats originally on the island was 1800, how many cats remained on the island after the rescue mission?
A: After the first mission, the number of cats remaining on the island was 1800 - 600 = 1200. If half of the remaining cats on the island were relocated to a rescue center inland, the number of cats taken by the wildlife service on the second mission is 1200 / 2 = 600 cats. The number of cats remaining on the island is 1200 - 600 = 600. The answer is 600.
