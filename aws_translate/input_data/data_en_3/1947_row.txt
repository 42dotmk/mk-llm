Q: Viviana has five more chocolate chips than Susana, while Susana has 3/4 as many vanilla chips as Viviana. If Viviana has 20 Vanilla chips and Susana 25 chocolate chips, calculate the total number of chips they have together.
A: Viviana has 20 Vanilla chips. Susana has 25 chocolate chips. Viviana has 25 + 5 = 30 chocolate chips. Susana has 3 / 4 * 20 = 15 Vanilla chips. They have 30 + 25 = 55 chocolate chips together. Together they have 20 + 15 = 35 vanilla chips. Together they have 35 + 55 = 90 chips. The answer is 90.
Question: Belinda can throw a ball at a speed of 20 feet/second. If the ball flies for 8 seconds before hitting the ground, and Belinda's border collie can run 5 feet/second, how many seconds will it take the border collie to catch up to the ball?
Answer: First find the total distance the ball flies: 20 feet / second * 8 seconds = 160 feet. Then divide that distance by the dog's speed to find how long it takes the dog to catch up to the ball: 160 feet / 5 feet / second = 32 seconds. The answer is 32.
[Question]Cadence has worked for her new company five months longer than she worked for her old company. If she worked at her old company for 3 years earning $5000 per month, and she's now earning 20% more in the new company, calculate the total amount of money she's earned in both companies in the period she's worked for them?
[Answer]In her old company, if she worked for three years, the total number of months she was paid for is 3 years * 12, which is the number of months in a year = 36 months. If each month she was paid $5000, her total earnings in the old company were $5000 * 36 = $180000. In her new company, she is paid 20% more, which is 20 / 100 * $5000 = $1000 per month more than what she was paid at the old company. In total, she earns $5000 + $1000 = $6000 per month in her new company. Since she's worked five months more in the new company than the old company, she has worked for 36 + 5 = 41 months in the new company. The total amount she's earned in the new company is $6000 * 41 = $246000. The combined total for both companies is $246000 + $180000 = $426000. The answer is 426000.
Q: Ronald can grill 15 hamburgers per session on his new grill. He needs to cook 115 hamburgers in total for tonight's party. He has already cooked 40 hamburgers. How many more sessions will it take Ronald to finish cooking all 115 hamburgers?
A: He has to cook 115 hamburgers and has already cooked 40 so he needs to cook 115 - 40 = 75 more hamburgers. He can only cook 15 hamburgers at a time so that means he has to cook 75 / 15 = 5 more cooking sessions. The answer is 5.
