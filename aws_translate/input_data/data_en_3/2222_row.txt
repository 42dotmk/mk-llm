The Viking Age, a captivating period in European history, started in the late 8th century and ended in the late 11th century. Although it's challenging to pinpoint exact dates due to the gradual nature of cultural shifts and historical events, most historians agree that the Viking Age began around 793 AD with the raid on the Lindisfarne monastery in northern England and concluded around 1066 AD with the Battle of Stamford Bridge in England and the Norman Conquest led by William the Conqueror.

The Vikings, hailing predominantly from present-day Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, were renowned for their expertise in seafaring and navigation. This skill allowed them to travel, explore, and establish settlements throughout numerous regions, including the British Isles, Iceland, Greenland, Russia, and parts of the European mainland. Their advances in shipbuilding and their iconic longships contributed significantly to their success as conquerors, traders, and explorers.

Throughout the Viking Age, these fierce warriors engaged in various activities, including raids, conquests, and trade with other cultures. The Vikings were known for their proficiency in battle, employing both superior tactics and advanced weapons and armor. Their aggressive approach and fearsome reputation led to widespread influence, as they significantly impacted the political and cultural landscape of the territories they encountered, and their influence can still be felt today.

In addition to their warrior reputation, the Vikings were also skilled traders. Their trade networks spanned as far east as the Byzantine Empire, the Islamic Caliphate, and even reached North America (where they established a short-lived settlement in present-day Newfoundland). Their trade activities fostered cultural exchange and the sharing of ideas, which played a vital role in shaping medieval Europe.

The gradual end of the Viking Age was due to several factors. Firstly, their sheer success led to Viking communities becoming more settled and less focused on raiding and conquest, as they became integrated into the societies they had once attacked. Secondly, Christianity played a significant role in shifting the Viking's traditional cultural values and motivations. Christian conversion from their native pagan beliefs contributed significantly to a more unified and pacified society, leading to the decline of their warrior culture.

Moreover, military and political pressure from neighboring states grew as they began to organize themselves and develop defensive measures against Viking attacks, making it increasingly challenging for the Vikings to continue their raids and conquests. Finally, the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 by William the Conqueror, a descendant of Viking ancestors, marked the end of an era and marked the transition into the next phase of European history.

In conclusion, the Viking Age started around 793 AD with the raid on Lindisfarne and lasted until around 1066 AD, ending with the Battle of Stamford Bridge and the Norman Conquest. This remarkable period in history is characterized by the Vikings' incredible feats in exploration, conquests, and cultural influences that continue to shape and inspire modern society.
