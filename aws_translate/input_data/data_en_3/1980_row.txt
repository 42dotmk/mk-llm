Q: Rory has 30 more jellybeans than her sister Gigi who has 15 jellybeans. Lorelai has already eaten three times the number of jellybeans that both girls have. How many jellybeans has Lorelai eaten?
A: Rory has 30 more jellybeans than Gigi who has 15 so Rory has 30 + 15 = 45 jellybeans. Rory has 45 jellybeans and Gigi has 15 so that's 45 + 15 = 60 jellybeans total. Lorelai has eaten three times the amount of jellybeans that both girls have so she has eaten 3 * 60 = 180 jellybeans. The answer is 180.
Question: Alice and Bob are each given $2000 to invest. Alice puts all of her money in the stock market and doubles her money. Bob invests in real estate and makes five times more money than he invested. How much more money does Bob have now than Alice?
Answer: When Alice invested her money in the stock market, her money doubled to $2000 * 2 = $4000. Bob, after investing in real estate, increased his money by 2000 * 5 = 10000. The total amount of money that Bob made after investing in real estate is $10000 + $2000 = $12000. Bob made $12000 - $4000 = $8000 more than Alice after investing his money. The answer is 8000.
[Question]Lisa is looking to attempt a World Record. She has decided to try and match Joey Chestnut's record of eating 75 full hotdogs, buns included, in 10 minutes. Halfway through the time Lisa has eaten 20 hotdogs. How many hotdogs will she have to eat per minute to at least tie Joey Chestnut's record?
[Answer]Joey Chestnut ate 75 hotdogs to claim the record and Lisa has eaten 20 hot dogs so far, so she still needs to eat 75 - 20 = 55 hotdogs to tie Joey Chestnut. Lisa has a 10 minute time period to eat the hotdogs and half the time has already passed, which means Lisa has 10 / 2 = 5 minutes left until the competition is over. If she needs to eat 55 hotdogs to tie Joey Chestnut and there are 5 minutes left in the competition period then she needs to eat 55 / 5 = 11 hot dogs per minute to have a chance of tying for a win. The answer is 11.
Q: Bob can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes. How many oysters can he shuck in 2 hours?
A: He shucks 10 oysters in 5 minutes we need to know how many 5 minute units are in 60 minutes so 60 / 5 = 12 units. He can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes and there are 12 5 minute units in an hour so he can shuck 10 * 12 = 120 oysters in 1 hour. If he can shuck 120 oysters in 1 hour, so for 2 hours in can shuck 2 * 120 = 240 oysters. The answer is 240.
Question: James invests $2000 a week into his bank account. He had $250,000 in his account when the year started. At the end of the year, he gets a windfall that is worth 50% more than what he has in his bank account.  How much money does he have?
Answer: He deposited 2000 * 52 = $104,000 into his account. So he has 250000 + 104000 = $354,000. His windfall is worth .5 * 354,000 = $177,000 more than his current account. That means he got 177,000 + 354,000 = $531,000. So he had a total of 531,000 + 354,000 = $885,000. The answer is 885000.
