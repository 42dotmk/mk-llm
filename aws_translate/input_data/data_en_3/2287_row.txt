The parade in Washington, D.C. in March 1913, officially known as the Woman Suffrage Procession, was a significant event in the American women's suffrage movement. Organized by the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), primarily under the leadership of Alice Paul and Lucy Burns, the parade aimed to garner attention, raise awareness, and build support for women's right to vote.

The purpose of the Woman Suffrage Procession can be broken down into several key objectives:

1. Raise awareness for the suffrage movement: The parade, held on March 3, 1913, was designed to be a grand spectacle, attracting thousands of participants and onlookers. With marchers from various states and backgrounds, the event aimed to convey the broad support and nationwide appeal of the women's suffrage movement.

2. Demonstrate political power: By organizing the parade the day before President Woodrow Wilson's inauguration, the suffragists sought to demonstrate their political prowess. By having a high-profile event coincide with the start of a new presidential term, they hoped to send a clear message to the incoming administration of the importance of the suffrage movement and the need for action on the federal level.

3. Appeal to the masses: The parade was an opportunity to present the movement in an accessible and engaging way. Participants dressed in white, the color commonly associated with the suffrage movement, and were joined by floats, bands, and other theatrical elements, drawing attention from the press and public. Additionally, with well-known figures such as lawyer Inez Milholland leading the parade, the suffragists aimed to gain a wider audience for their cause.

4. Unify the movement: The Woman Suffrage Procession brought together a diverse group of women from different regions, political affiliations, and social backgrounds. This diversity was an essential aspect of the movement that helped to dispel the myth that women's suffrage only appealed to a minority of the population. The parade helped showcase the inclusive and collaborative spirit of the movement and endeavored to create a sense of unity among the various suffrage organizations and activists.

5. Expose injustices: The Woman Suffrage Procession was not without challenges. Parade participants encountered hostility, jeering, and even violence from the crowd. Police provided little assistance, and the situation became so dangerous that soldiers had to be called in to protect the marchers. This mistreatment of the participants was widely reported in the press, helping to expose the hypocrisy and injustice women faced as they campaigned for their right to vote. This negative experience further galvanized the movement and rallied supporters around the need for change.

In summary, the Woman Suffrage Procession in Washington, D.C. in March 1913 aimed to increase awareness, demonstrate political power, appeal to the masses, unify the suffrage movement, and expose injustices faced by women. The event, despite the challenges encountered, was successful in gaining public support and attention for the movement, contributing to women's eventual achievement of the right to vote through the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920.
