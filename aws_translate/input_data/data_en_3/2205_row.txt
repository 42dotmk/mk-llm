Q: There are 66 goats at a farm and twice as many chickens. If the number of ducks is half of the total of the goats and chickens, and the number of pigs is a third of the number of ducks, how many more goats are there than pigs?
A: There are 66 x 2 = 132 chickens. There are 66 + 132 = 198 goats and chickens. There are are 198 / 2 = 99 ducks. There are 99 / 3 = 33 pigs. There are 66 - 33 = 33 more goats than pigs. The answer is 33.
Question: A candy store uses food colouring in various candies. Each lollipop uses 5ml of food colouring, and each hard candy also needs food colouring. In one day, the candy store makes 100 lollipops and 5 hard candies. They do not use food colouring in anything else. The store has used 600ml of food colouring by the end of the day. How much food colouring, in millilitres, does each hard candy need?
Answer: In total, the lollipops needed 5ml of food colouring * 100 lollipops = 500ml of food colouring. This means that the hard candies needed 600ml total food colouring – 500ml food colouring for lollipops = 100ml of food colouring. So each hard candy needed 100ml of food colouring / 5 hard candies = 20 ml of food colouring. The answer is 20.
[Question]Chris is trying to sell his car for $5200 and has gotten two price offers. One buyer offered to pay the full price if Chris would pay for the car maintenance inspection, which cost a tenth of Chris’s asking price. The other buyer agreed to pay the price if Chris replaced the headlights for $80 and the tires for three times as much. What is the difference between the amounts Chris will earn from the two offers?
[Answer]Chris would earn 5200 - 5200 / 10 = 5200 - 520 = $4680 from the first buyer. He would earn 5200 - 80 - 80 * 3 = 5200 - 80 * 4 = 5200 - 320 = $4880 from the second buyer. The difference between Chris’s earnings would be 4880 - 4680 = $200. The answer is 200.
Q: Dan spent an hour doing 400 work tasks at $0.25 each. Then Dan spent an hour doing 5 work tasks at $2.00 each. How much more did Dan make doing the good work compared to the lower-paid work?
A: Dan spent an hour doing 400 tasks * $.25 = $100. Dan spent an hour doing 5 tasks * $2.00 each = $10.00. Dan made $100 - $10 = $90.00 per hour more doing the higher paid work. The answer is 90.
Question: Luna, the poodle, is supposed to eat 2 cups of kibble every day. But Luna's master, Mary, and her husband, Frank, sometimes feed Luna too much kibble. One day, starting with a new, 12-cup bag of kibble, Mary gave Luna 1 cup of kibble in the morning and 1 cup of kibble in the evening, But on the same day, Frank also gave Luna 1 cup of kibble in the afternoon and twice as much in the late evening as he had given Luna in the afternoon. The next morning, how many cups of kibble will Mary find remaining in the bag?
Answer: Mary fed Luna 1 + 1 = 2 cups of kibble. Frank fed Luna 1 - cup plus twice 1 - cup, or 1 + 2 = 3 cups of kibble. In total, they fed Luna 2 + 3 = 5 cups of kibble. Thus, if the new bag held 12 cups of kibble, the next morning, 12 - 5 = 7 cups of kibble remained in the bag. The answer is 7.
