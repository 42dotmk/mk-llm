Question: Quincy just bought a car using a 5 year loan with no interest. He put $5,000.00 down as a down payment making his monthly payment $250.00. What is the price of the car?
Answer: 1 year has 12 months and his loan is for 5 years so that's 12 * 5 = 60 months. His car payment is $250.00 a month for 60 months so 250 * 60 = $15,000. He also put a down payment of $5,000 on the car so the total price of the car is $5,000 + $15,000 = $20,000 car price. The answer is 20000.

Q: A party hall has 3 decorative light bulbs; a red light bulb which comes on every 2 seconds, a green one every 3 seconds and a blue one every 4 seconds. If they are put on at the same time, what is the shortest time after which the three bulbs will be on at the same time?
A: The blue light bulb comes on every 2 seconds so it will be on after 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14... seconds (multiples of 2). The red light bulb comes on every 3 seconds so it will be on after 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18... seconds (multiples of 3). The blue light bulb comes on every 4 seconds so it will be on after 4, 8, 12, 16, 20... seconds (multiples of 4). The shortest time after which all three will be on is 12 seconds which is the least common multiple of the set of multiples. The answer is 12.
Question: Cathy and Chris got summer jobs at the cake shop and were supposed to work 20 hours per week each for 2 months. During that time, Chris got sick for one week and Cathy took her shifts. If there are four weeks in a month, how many hours did Cathy work during the 2 months?
Answer: There are 4 weeks in a month so Cathy and Chris were supposed to work for 4 weeks / month x 2 months = 8 weeks each. Since Chris got sick then Chris was only able to work for 8 weeks - 1 week = 7 weeks while Cathy worked for 8 weeks + 1 week = 9 weeks. Therefore, Cathy worked for 9 weeks x 20 hours / week = 180 hours. The answer is 180.
[Question]An apple tree has three times as many apples as the number of plums on a plum tree. If Damien picks 3/5 of the fruits from the trees, calculate the total number of plums and apples remaining on the tree if there were 180 apples on the apple tree before Damien picked any of the fruits.
[Answer]Initially, the were 180 / / 3 = 60 plums on the plum tree. When Damien picked 3 / 5 of the apples from the apple tree, he picked 3 / 5 * 180 = 108 apples. The number of apples remaining on the apple tree is 180 - 108 = 72. The number of plums that Damien picked from the plum tree is 3 / 5 * 60 = 36. The number of plums remaining on the plum tree is 60 - 36 = 24. The total number of fruits remaining on the trees is 72 apples + 24 plums = 96. The answer is 96.
