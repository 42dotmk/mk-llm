There could be a myriad of reasons why your questions on Quora are not getting answered, and there are several factors to consider. Firstly, let us understand the key differences between these two questions:

1. "Why are people not answering my questions on Quora?" - This question focuses on people not answering your questions in general.
2. "Why don't people answer me on Quora?" - This question also refers to people not answering your questions but may imply a more personal aspect, i.e., 'why don’t people answer me?' specifically.

Both these questions essentially address the same concern, so based on the given options, the answer is [-] yes.

Now, let's delve into some possible reasons why your questions might not be getting answered on Quora:

1. Quality and clarity of your questions: If your questions are not clear or lack proper context, other users might find it challenging to provide insightful answers. Make sure to be clear and concise while also providing enough background information.

2. Timing: The time when you post your question can also influence the chances of receiving answers. If you’re posting at a time when many users might be inactive, you may not get immediate responses. Experiment with posting at different times of the day to gauge when it’s most effective.

3. Uniqueness or popularity of your question: If your question has already been answered multiple times or if it pertains to a very niche topic, users might be less inclined to respond.

4. Competition with similar questions: With a surplus of questions being asked every day on Quora, it's possible that your question is overshadowed by others that have gained more traction or piqued the interest of potential answerers.

5. Incorrect or insufficient tagging: Quora relies heavily on tags to enable users to find questions that match their areas of expertise. Ensure that you tag your questions properly so that they reach your desired audience.

6. Expertise of the users: It could be that the users who have viewed your question simply do not have the knowledge or experience to provide a satisfactory answer.

7. Engagement with the community: Building an active presence on the platform can increase your chances of getting answers. Engage with others on Quora by answering questions, upvoting valuable answers, and adding comments.

8. Patience and persistence: Sometimes, it takes a while for questions to gain momentum and receive answers. It is crucial to be patient and persistent in your quest for answers on Quora.

To increase your chances of receiving answers, you can:

1. Improve the quality and clarity of your questions.
2. Post questions at different times of the day to determine peak engagement.
3. Ensure proper tagging of questions to reach the appropriate audience.
4. Make your questions unique, interesting, or relevant to current trends.
5. Participate actively in the Quora community to build a more extensive network of potential answerers.
6. Keep an eye on the questions you post and update them if necessary, to refine their content or keep them in line with current trends.

With these strategies in place, you will likely see an upswing in the engagement and answers your questions receive on Quora.
