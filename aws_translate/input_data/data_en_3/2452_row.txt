To determine whether it is possible to conclude that if the given premise is true, the hypothesis is also true, it is crucial to examine the relationships between the variables and the statements of the premise and hypothesis.

Premise:
By using the evaluation technique, the need for obtaining productive hourly costs translated into dollars using purchasing power parities is avoided. 

This premise states that when employing the evaluation technique mentioned (though the specifics of this technique are not provided), organizations and individuals can eliminate the need to calculate productive hourly costs by converting them into dollars using purchasing power parities (PPP). Since PPP accounts for differences in the cost of living and price levels between countries, it essentially equalizes the purchasing power of currencies, allowing specific comparisons to be made.

Hypothesis:
The money saved by using these techniques can be spent on more important things.

This hypothesis implies that the use of the evaluation technique will result in cost savings, and the money that would have been spent on calculating productive hourly costs can instead be allocated to other, more essential matters.

To determine the validity of the hypothesis based on the premise, it is necessary to establish if there is a causal relationship between the use of the evaluation technique and the generation of cost savings. 

It is important to clarify that cost savings, as mentioned in the hypothesis, may be interpreted in two primary ways: actual monetary savings or opportunity cost savings. The latter refers to the reduction in time and effort spent on calculating costs using purchasing power parities, which allows the organization to allocate its resources – including staff and funds – more effectively. This clarification is relevant because the premise does not explicitly say that there will be cost savings; it only states that this method prevents the need for cost translations using PPP.

Given this context, one can argue that the hypothesis can be true if the premise is true, but the conclusion is not definitive. The premise suggests that the evaluation technique can potentially lead to both monetary and opportunity cost savings, but it does not guarantee such savings.

To strengthen the argument and conclusively state that the premise entails the truth of the hypothesis, additional information and assumptions need to be established: 

1. The evaluation technique is less expensive or resource-intensive than calculating productive hourly costs using PPP.

2. There are no hidden or additional costs associated with implementing and using the evaluation technique.

3. The saved time and resources are reallocated to more important things, which implies that the organization is capable of identifying and utilizing these priorities effectively.

In summary, while it is possible to conclude that the hypothesis could be true if the premise is true, there is no absolute certainty. The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is dependent on additional assumptions that need to be clarified, and whether or not the organization using the evaluation technique can effectively make use of the (potential) savings generated.
