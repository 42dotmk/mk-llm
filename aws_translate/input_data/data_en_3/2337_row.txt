Question: Mikey likes his honey cluster of oats cereal. In each spoonful, there are 4 clusters of oats. In each bowl of cereal, he gets 25 spoonfuls of cereal. If each box of cereal contains 500 clusters of oats, how many bowlfuls of cereal are in each box?
Answer: If each spoonful contains 4 clusters of oats, and each bowl of cereal has 25 spoonfuls, then in each bowl there are 4 * 25 = 100 clusters of oats. And If each box of cereal contains 500 clusters of oats, then there are 500 / 100 = 5 bowlfuls of cereal in every box. The answer is 5.
[Question]Miley bought two cellphones for her parents. Each cellphone costs $800 but, since she is buying two units, she will receive a 5% discount for the total cost. How much did Miley pay?
[Answer]Two cellphones cost $800 x 2 = $1600. The 5% discount amounts to $1600 x 5 / 100 = $80. So Miley paid $1600 - $80 = $1520. The answer is 1520.
Q: Every ten minutes during sunset, the sky changes to a new color. How many colors did the sky turn over the two hours of a long summer sunset if each hour is sixty minutes long?
A: At 60 minutes per hour, the sunset was 2 * 60 = 120 minutes long. The sky changes color every 10 minutes, so it turned 120 / 10 = 12 colors over the summer sunset. The answer is 12.
Question: Jan's three-eyed lizard has 3 times more wrinkles than eyes, and seven times more spots than wrinkles. How many fewer eyes does the lizard have than the combined number of spots and wrinkles?
Answer: Three times more wrinkles than three eyes is 3 * 3 = 9 wrinkles. Seven times more spots than wrinkles is 7 * 9 = 63 spots. Therefore, the combined number of spots and wrinkles on the lizard is 63 + 9 = 72 spots and wrinkles. Thus, the lizard has 72 - 3 = 69 fewer eyes than spots and wrinkles. The answer is 69.
[Question]Smaug the dragon hoards 100 gold coins, 60 silver coins, and 33 copper coins. If each silver coin is worth 8 copper coins, and each gold coin is worth 3 silver coins, what is the total value of Smaug's hoard expressed as a number of copper coins?
[Answer]First figure out how many silver coins the 100 gold coins are worth by multiplying the number of gold coins by the exchange rate between gold and silver: 100 gold * 3 silver / gold = 300 silver. Then add the value of the gold in silver to the number of silver coins to find the total value of the gold and silver expressed in silver coins: 300 silver + 60 silver = 360 silver. Now multiply that value by the exchange rate between silver and copper to express its value in terms of copper coins: 360 silver * 8 copper / silver = 2880 copper. Then add the value of the gold and silver expressed in copper coins (the value from the last step) to the number of copper coins to find the total value of the hoard: 2880 + 33 = 2913. The answer is 2913.
