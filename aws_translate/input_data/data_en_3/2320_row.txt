Title: Unraveling the Mystery: Which Team Scored the First Touchdown?

Introduction: 
In the world of competitive sports, it's always exciting to look back at history and identify the trailblazers who have reached major milestones. In American football, one of the most memorable milestones would be the first-ever touchdown. We will dive into the intriguing history of the sport and endeavor to unlock the mystery of which team scored the first touchdown.

Step 1: Investigate the origins of American football
To determine which team scored the first touchdown, it is crucial to understand how the modern sport of American football originated. American football has its roots in the traditional games of rugby and soccer. In the early 19th century, various versions of football evolved in universities across the United States.

Step 2: Identify the point when the evolution of modern American football began
The first official rules of football, resembling rugby, were established in 1873 through a convention among representatives of Columbia, Harvard, Princeton, and Yale. Walter Camp, also known as the "Father of American Football," further developed the game by proposing key rule changes, eventually transforming it into the sport we know today.

Step 3: Identify the first games played under modern American football rules
Once we understand the evolution of American football rules, we can pinpoint the first games that were played under these rules. The first intercollegiate football game under modern rules occurred between Princeton and Rutgers on November 6, 1869, which predates the key rule changes proposed by Camp. Thus, we must look further than this game to find the first touchdown.

Step 4: Examine the game where touchdowns were officially introduced
One of the significant rule changes proposed by Camp was the introduction of the touchdown in 1882. Before this, the primary method of scoring was through "touchdowns in goal," which involved kicking the ball through the goal. Therefore, to uncover the team that scored the first touchdown, we must examine games played after the 1882 rule change.

Step 5: Research the games following the 1882 rule change
The first college games held under the new rules, which included the scoring of touchdowns, took place in the fall of 1882. Yale and Wesleyan played a game on October 25, 1882, with Yale scoring the first touchdown. However, it's important to note that some sources claim that Stevens Institute of Technology and College of the City of New York played an unofficial game in April 1882, during which Stevens scored the first touchdown. Due to the unofficial nature of this game, the first valid touchdown is widely recognized to be during the October Yale-Wesleyan game.

Conclusion:
After effectively investigating the origins and evolution of American football, we have successfully unraveled the mystery of which team scored the first touchdown. The first officially recognized touchdown was scored by Yale during their game against Wesleyan on October 25, 1882. With this answer in hand, we can continue to appreciate and celebrate the thrilling history of American football, honoring those who laid the foundation for the captivating sport we enjoy today.
