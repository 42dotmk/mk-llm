The missing first step of the following process is the extraction and transportation of coal from a coal mine to the coal-fired power plant. 

Here is the revised and detailed process:

1. Extraction and transportation of coal: Coal is extracted from underground and surface mines using various mining techniques, including both manual labor and highly mechanized methods such as surface mining, underground mining, mountaintop removal, and open-pit mining. Once extracted, the coal is then transported to the coal-fired power plant by means such as conveyor belts, trucks, trains, or barges, depending on the distance, terrain, and available infrastructure.

2. Coal processing and preparation: Upon arrival at the power plant, the coal undergoes processing and preparation to remove impurities and obtain the required size of coal particles. This may involve techniques such as washing, crushing, and screening, which help to improve the combustion efficiency of the coal and reduce pollutant emissions during the burning process.

3. Breaking down the coal: The coal is crushed or pulverized into smaller particles, generally less than 2mm in size, to ensure an efficient and complete combustion process. By breaking it down, the coal can be more easily mixed with hot air and sent into the boiler.

4. Mixing coal particles with hot air: The pulverized coal particles are then mixed with hot air, which is pre-heated to a high temperature. This mixture enables the coal to burn more efficiently and helps transport it into the boiler.

5. Combustion in the boiler: As the coal and hot air mixture enters the boiler, it ignites and burns intensely. This combustion process generates significant heat, which is absorbed by the water-filled boiler tubes that surround the combustion chamber.

6. Steam generation: The heat from the combustion process is transferred to the water in the boiler, causing it to heat up and convert into steam. This high-pressure steam is forced through the boiler and directed toward the turbine blades.

7. Power generation: The high-pressure steam flows over the turbine blades, causing them to spin and drive the generator. As the blades rotate, they create a rotating magnetic field, which induces an electric current in the wire coils within the generator. This generates electricity that can be transmitted to the power grid.

8. Condensing the steam: After passing through the turbine, the steam loses its heat and condenses back into water. This condensed water is collected and returned to the boiler, where it undergoes the same process of heating and turning into steam again.

9. Recirculation of water and process repetition: The water is continuously recirculated through the system to maintain a steady supply of steam, ensuring that the power plant can continue to generate electricity. This closed-loop process repeats continuously as long as there is a supply of coal and the necessary conditions are maintained within the power plant.

In summary, the missing first step involves the extraction and transportation of coal from its source to the coal-fired power plant, which precedes the series of steps required to convert coal into electricity efficiently and safely.
