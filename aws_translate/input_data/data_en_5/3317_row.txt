after breakfast, we will pick you up at the entrance door of your hotel to transfer you to your liveaboard, your accommodation for the next days.

Upon our arrival at the dock, our crew will welcome you on board the liveaboard and help you settle into your cabin. You will then be introduced to the rest of the guests and have a brief orientation about the schedule, safety procedures, and the facilities available on the liveaboard.

Our liveaboard is spacious, comfortable, and well-equipped to ensure a pleasant experience throughout your stay. In your private cabin, you will find a comfortable bed, air conditioning, a private bathroom, and ample storage space for your belongings. Communal areas include a spacious dining area, a lounge, an open deck, as well as a well-stocked library on marine life and a multimedia area for photographers and videographers.

After settling in, we will set sail for our first destination. While en route, you can take the time to relax on the deck, get to know your fellow guests, or take a refreshing nap in your cabin. Our experienced and knowledgeable staff will be present at all times to attend to your needs and answer any questions you may have about your upcoming adventures.

Meals on the liveaboard are expertly prepared by our on-board chef, who will provide you with a variety of delicious and satisfying meals throughout the day, taking into consideration any dietary restrictions you may have. You can expect a mix of local and international cuisine, as well as a wide array of fruit, vegetables, and snacks to keep you energized during your dives and excursions.

Our diving schedule will typically include three to four dives per day, with the first dive taking place early in the morning. After breakfast, you will be briefed on the dive site and any specific safety measures to be taken into account. Our dive instructors will make sure that you are familiar with your equipment and are prepared for the dive. Once underwater, you will be amazed by the diversity and beauty of the marine life and coral reefs you will encounter.

Between dives, you will have time to relax on the liveaboard, share your experiences with fellow divers, or even take part in workshops led by our crew members. These could be related to underwater photography, marine biology, or even navigational skills, depending on the interests of the guests on board.

In addition to diving, our liveaboard also offers snorkeling, kayaking, and stand-up paddleboarding as alternative activities for guests to enjoy the beauty of the ocean and its surroundings. This will be perfect for guests who want a break from diving or simply want to try a different adventure.

Finally, after several days of action-packed adventures and memorable diving experiences, our liveaboard journey will come to an end. We will return to the dock and help you transition back to shore-based accommodations. Our team will assist you in transferring your belongings and saying our goodbyes, leaving you with unforgettable memories and exciting stories to share with your friends and family back home.

Rest assured, choosing a liveaboard experience for your vacation will unlock a world of underwater beauty and adventure that is truly unparalleled. So, pack your bags and get ready for a vacation of a lifetime!
