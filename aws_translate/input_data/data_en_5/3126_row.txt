a). Negative Movie Review: Mortal Kombat (2021)

Title: Kombat Meets Mortality

The highly anticipated Mortal Kombat (2021) may promise a potential balm to long-time fans of the video game franchise, but sadly, it fails to deliver the depth and excitement that its predecessors have created over the years. Directed by Simon McQuoid, in his directorial debut, Mortal Kombat somehow manages to land more than a few punches below the belt with its weak plot development, questionable casting decisions, and unsatisfactory execution of its iconic fighting scenes.

The story begins with legendary warrior Hanzo Hasashi (Hiroyuki Sanada), who later becomes the fan-favorite Scorpion, as it delves into his tragic backstory. This captivating introduction raised expectations for the rest of the film, but rather abruptly, the narrative shifts focus to a new, less appealing character, Cole Young (Lewis Tan). An uninspired addition to the Mortal Kombat universe, Cole Young serves as an ostensibly relatable protagonist but is weighed down with cliched motivations and a lackluster personality.

As the movie trudges on, the viewers are introduced to predictable plot points and rather shallow interpretations of their favorite characters from the original video game series, like Sonya Blade (Jessica McNamee), Lord Raiden (Tadanobu Asano), and Kano (Josh Lawson). The actors do their best with the material given to them, but the script offers little breathing room for meaningful character growth or respite from the cliches that often plague video game adaptations.

The fight scenes, which should be the crowning achievement of a movie like Mortal Kombat, leave a lot to be desired. While some do offer a splash of visceral excitement, much of the choreography is unsatisfying and falls prey to a relentless reliance on the franchise's trademark gore and over-the-top violence. The fatalities, once a thrilling feature of the video games, become tiresome gimmicks due in large part to the excessive and gratuitous use of CGI.

Furthermore, Mortal Kombat's confusing pacing often feels like the audience is jumping from one scene to another without a natural progression. One moment, the group will be strategizing and discussing the nature of their powers, only to be thrown headfirst into fight scenes or forced plot developments that seem to come out of nowhere. This disjointed flow quickly becomes jarring and allows little room for the storyline to find its footing.

Though there are a few glimmers of potential, such as the movie's impressive and atmospheric recreation of the game's universe, the immense burden of fan expectations and the sheer ambition of adapting the premise to film ultimately leads to Mortal Kombat crumbling under its own weight. The combination of weak storylines, peculiar casting choices, a lack of cohesive pacing, and missed opportunities leads to an overall uninspiring and disheartening movie-going experience.

Thus, the 2021 version of Mortal Kombat manages to strike an underwhelming blow to the video game adaptations genre, sending it reeling backward instead of progressing forward in its quest to be taken seriously by critics and fans alike. For now, it seems that the iconic phrase "Finish Him!" rings a little too true for this disappointing film endeavor.
