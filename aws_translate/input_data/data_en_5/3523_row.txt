[Question]The bakery made 95 muffins. They will be packed in boxes with 5 muffins in each box. If there are only 10 available boxes, how many boxes do they still need to pack all the muffins?
[Answer]A total of 10 x 5 = 50 muffins will be packed in 10 boxes. So 95 - 50 = 45 muffins still need to be packed in the boxes. Thus, 45 / 5 = 9 boxes are still needed to pack all those 45 muffins. The answer is 9.
Q: Mr. Bodhi is transporting some animals using a yacht across a river. He has 20 cows, 15 foxes and three times as many zebras as foxes. To balance the yacht to ensure a smooth sail across the river, the total number of animals in the yacht needs to be 100. If he decides to add sheep to the yacht to make the yacht sail-worthy, how many sheep did he add to the yacht?
A: The number of cows and foxes in the yacht is 20 + 15 = 35. Mr. Bodhi also has three times as many zebras as foxes in the yacht, equal to 3 * 15 = 45 zebras. The number of animals in the yacht so far is 35 + 45 = 80. To balance the yacht, Mr. Bodhi needs to add 100 - 80 = 20 sheep. The answer is 20.
Question: The garbage truck passes through Daniel's neighborhood on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. In each garbage collection, an average of 200 kg is taken. Due to obstruction in the roads leading to Daniel's neighborhood, the garbage truck stops passing through for two weeks. During the first week, people in Daniel's neighborhood pile the extra garbage around the dumpster, during the second week they apply a policy of cutting their amount of garbage in half. How many kilograms of garbage have accumulated in Daniel's neighborhood during the 2 weeks?
Answer: The garbage truck passes through Daniel's neighborhood for 3 days. In the first week, 200 * 3 = 600 kilograms of garbage are accumulated. In the second week, half the amount of garbage is accumulated, which is 600 / 2 = 300 kg of garbage. During the 2 weeks, 600 + 300 = 900 kg of garbage are accumulated. The answer is 900.
[Question]Julie runs the school newspaper. In preparation for printing the next issue of The School News, she bought two boxes of standard paper, each containing 5 packages, with 250 sheets of paper per package. If this issue of The School News uses 25 sheets of paper to print one newspaper, how many newspapers can Julie print with the paper that she purchased?
[Answer]Five packages per box, with 250 sheets per package is 5 * 250 = 1250 sheets per box. Two boxes contain a total of 1250 * 2 = 2500 sheets. If each newspaper requires 25 pages, then with 2500 sheets she can print 2500 / 25 = 100 newspapers. The answer is 100.
Q: A superhero can use superhuman speed to run 10 miles in 4 minutes. The supervillain has an Evil-Mobile that drives 100 miles per hour. How many miles farther can the superhero run in an hour than the supervillain can drive?
A: There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the superhero will run 60 / 4 = 15 intervals of 10 miles in an hour. Thus, the superhero can run 15 * 10 = 150 miles in an hour. The superhero can run 150 - 100 = 50 miles farther than the supervillain can drive in an hour. The answer is 50.
