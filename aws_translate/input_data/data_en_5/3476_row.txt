Question: The gauge on a water tank shows that the tank is 1/3 full of water. To fill the tank, 16 gallons of water are added. How many gallons of water does the tank hold when full?
Answer: Given that the tank is 1 / 3 full of water, and that it requires 16 gallons to fill. 1 full tank - 1 / 3 tank = 2 / 3 of the tank is empty, which is equal to 16 gallons. If 2 / 3 of the tank equals 16 gallons, this means 1 / 3 of the tank is equal to 16 / 2 gallons = 8 gallons. The total capacity of the tank or how much the tanks holds = 16 + 8 = 24 gallons. The answer is 24.
[Question]Sam the butcher made sausage by grinding up 10 pounds of spicy meat mix, loading it into a tube casing, and creating a string of 40 sausage links. Then, she hung up the string of sausage links in her cooler. Later that evening, Brandy, Sam’s Golden Retriever, broke into the cooler and ate 12 links of sausage. After Brandy’s feast, how many ounces of sausage meat were contained in the remaining links?
[Answer]There are 16 ounces in one pound, and thus in 10 pounds of meat mix there are 10 * 16 = 160 ounces of sausage meat. Thus, the 40 sausage links contained 160 ounces of meat, or 160 / 40 = 4 ounces per link. If Brandy ate 12 links, then 40 - 12 = 28 links remained. Thus, 28 remaining links, at 4 ounces per link, contained 28 * 4 = 112 ounces of meat. The answer is 112.
Q: Sarah interviewed 450 students at her school and asked them which fruit they liked best - oranges, apples, pears or strawberries. 70 students said they liked oranges, 120 students said they liked pears, and 147 students said they liked apples. How many students picked strawberries as their favorite fruit from the list?
A: First, you have to add the number of students that liked the three other fruits. Therefore, you have to add 70 + 120 + 147. This gives you a sum of 337. We know that 450 students were interviewed, so you have to subtract 337 from 450 to get the number of students who liked strawberries. 450 - 337 = 113 students liked strawberries best out of all of the fruits. The answer is 113.
Question: Three years ago, Rosie purchased an art piece for $4000. The same art piece will be three times as much in another three years. How much money will the art piece have increased by?
Answer: If the art piece was bought at $4000, and its price in three years will be three times its buying price, it will be worth 3 * $4000 = $12000 in another three years. The price of the art piece will increase by $12000 - $4000 = $8000. The answer is 8000.
[Question]300 cows in a field are made up of male and female cows. There are twice as many females as males. Half the females are spotted, and half the males have horns. How many more females with spots are there than males with horns?
[Answer]There are (300 / 3) x 2 = 100 x 2 = 200 females cows in the field. There are 200 / 2 = 100 male cows in the field. 200 / 2 = 100 female cows are spotted. 100 / 2 = 50 male cows have horns. There are 100 - 50 = 50 more females with spots than males with horns. The answer is 50.
