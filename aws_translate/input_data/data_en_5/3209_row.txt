[Question]Fiona completed 36 math questions in an hour. Shirley was able to complete twice as many math questions within that same time, and Kiana completed half of the sum of Fiona and Shirley's math questions. If they each did the same number of questions the following hour, how many math questions did all three girls complete in 2 hours?
[Answer]Shirley completed 36 x 2 = 72 questions. The sum of Fiona and Shirley's questions is 36 + 72 = 108. Kiana completed 108 / 2 = 54 questions. In one hour, they completed 108 + 54 = 162 questions. In two hours, they completed 162 x 2 = 324 questions. The answer is 324.
Q: Susan is making jewelry with a repeating pattern that has 3 green beads, 5 purple beads, and twice as many red beads as green beads. If the pattern repeats three times per bracelet and 5 times per necklace, how many beads does she need to make 1 bracelets and 10 necklaces?
A: First find the number of red beads per repeat: 3 green * 2 red / green = 6 red. Then add the number of beads of each color to find the total number of bead per repeat: 6 beads + 3 beads + 5 beads = 14 beads. Then multiply the number of beads per repeat by the number of repeats per bracelet to find the number of beads per bracelet: 14 beads / repeat * 3 repeats / bracelet = 42 beads / bracelet. Then multiply the number of beads per repeat by the number of repeats per necklace to find the number of beads per necklace: 14 beads / repeat * 5 repeats / necklace = 70 beads / necklace. Then multiply the number of beads per necklace by the number of necklaces to find the total number of beads used in the necklaces: 70 beads / necklace * 10 necklaces = 700 beads. Then add the number of beads used in a bracelet to the number of beads in the necklaces to find the total number of beads used: 700 beads + 42 beads = 742 beads. The answer is 742.

[Question]Jack needs to put his shoes on, then help both his toddlers tie their shoes. If it takes Jack 4 minutes to put his shoes on, and three minutes longer to help each toddler with their shoes, how long does it take them to get ready?
[Answer]First figure out how long it takes to help one toddler: 4 minutes + 3 minutes = 7 minutes. Then multiply the time per toddler by the number of toddlers: 7 minutes / toddler * 2 toddlers = 14 minutes. Now add the time spent helping the toddlers to the time Jack spends on his own shoes: 14 minutes + 4 minutes = 18 minutes. The answer is 18.
