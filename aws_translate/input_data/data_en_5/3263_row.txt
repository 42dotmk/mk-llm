Question: Francine has five full boxes of crayons and 5 loose crayons, and her friend has 27 loose crayons. They need to put all of their loose crayons in a box. How many more boxes do they need if Francine has a total of 85 crayons?
Answer: Francine has 85 - 5 = 80 crayons in total that are in the boxes. Thus, each box of crayons is filled with 80 / 5 = 16 crayons. A total of 5 + 27 = 32 crayons need to be placed in the boxes. Therefore, they still need 32 / 16 = 2 boxes for the loose crayons. The answer is 2.
[Question]Hansel makes $30,000 a year and just received a 10% raise. Gretel makes the same amount as Hansel but received a 15% raise. How much more money will Gretel make compared to Hansel?
[Answer]Hansel makes $30,000 and received a 10% raise so his raise is 30,000 * .10 = $3,000.00. Hansel now makes 30,000 + 3,000 = $33,000 a year. Gretel makes $30,000 and received a 15% raise so her raise is 30,000 * .15 = $4,500.00. Gretel now makes 30,000 + 4,500 = $34,500 a year. If Gretel makes $34,500 a year and Hansel makes $33,000 then Gretel makes 34,500 - 33,000 = $1,500 more a year than Hansel. The answer is 1500.

Question: A spaceship is traveling to another planet. The spaceship travels at a consistent speed its entire journey unless it is stopped for the crew’s break. After launch, the spaceship traveled for 10 hours then stopped for 3 hours. It then traveled for another 10 hours then stopped for 1 hour. After this, the spaceship would take an hour’s break after every 11 hours of traveling and maintained this routine until the end of its journey. If the entire journey took 3 days then how long, in hours, was the spaceship not moving?
Answer: On the first day, the spaceship spent a total of 10 hours + 10 hours = 20 hours traveling. On the first day, the spaceship spent a total of 3 hours + 1 hour = 4 hours not moving. This is a total of 20 hours traveling + 4 hours not moving = 24 hours or 1 day. So the rest of the journey took place over 3 days journey – 1 first day = 2 days. This is the same as 2 days * 24 hours = 48 hours. In these 2 days, the spaceship’s time is split into 11 hours traveling + 1 hour break = 12 hour blocks. So in the last 2 days, the spaceship wasn't moving for a total of 48 hours / 12 hour blocks = 4 hours. Adding this to breaks from the first day shows that the spaceship was not moving for a total of 4 + 4 = 8 hours. The answer is 8.
[Question]Mark made a chalkboard that is 3 feet wide. It is 2 times as long as it is wide. What is the area of the chalkboard?
