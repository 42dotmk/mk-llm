Q: Eddie can bake 3 pies a day. His sister can bake 6 pies while his mother can bake 8 pies a day. How many pies will they be able to bake in 7 days?
A: Eddie bakes 3 x 7 = 21 pies for 7 days. His sister bakes 6 x 7 = 42 pies for 7 days. His mother can bake 8 x 7 = 56 pies for 7 days. Therefore, they are able to bake 21 + 42 + 56 = 119 pies in 7 days. The answer is 119.
Question: There were 80 people at a football game on Saturday. On Monday, 20 fewer people were at the football game. On Wednesday, 50 more people were at the game than on Monday. On Friday, there were the same number of people as on Saturday and Monday combined. If their expected total audience at the football game for a week is 350, how many more people attended the games than they had expected?
Answer: On Monday, 80 - 20 = 60 people attended the game. On Wednesday, 60 + 50 = 110 people attended the game. On Friday, 80 + 60 = 140 people attended the game. A total of 80 + 60 + 110 + 140 = 390 people attended the games in a week. Therefore, 390 - 350 = 40 people more attended the games than they had expected. The answer is 40.
[Question]Alice needs to sell $1000 of shoes to meet her quota. Adidas cost $45, Nike cost $60, and Reeboks cost $35. If she sells 8 Nikes, 6 Adidas's, and 9 Reeboks, how much is she short or above her goal?
[Answer]The total dollar amount of Nike's sold is 8 * $60 = $480. The total dollar amount of Adidas's sold is 6 * $45 = $270. The total dollar amount of Reebok's sold is 9 * $35 = $315. The total dollar amount that Alice sold was $480 + $270 + $315 = $1065. Therefore, she sold above her goal by $1065 - $1000 = $65. The answer is 65.
Q: Ruby was going to order pizza for dinner. Her son would only eat pepperoni pizza. Her daughter would only eat sausage. Ruby and her husband wanted black olive and mushroom pizza. To make life easy, Ruby decided to order an entire pizza for each of her children and she would split one with her husband. The pizza restaurant charged $10.00 per pizza and $1.00 per topping. She also needed to add a $5.00 tip. Including tip, how much would the pizza order cost?
A: Ruby was going to order 1 for her son, 1 for her daughter and 1 to share with her husband. So she needed to order 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 pizzas. Each pizza cost $10 and she was ordering 3 so that comes to 10 * 3 = $30.00. She needed to order pepperoni, sausage, black olive and mushroom, which came to 4 toppings at $1.00 each so 4 * 1 = $4.00 extra for toppings. The pizzas cost $30 and $4 for the toppings so the total costs of the pizzas came to 30 + 4 = $34.00. She also had to add a $5.00 tip to her current order total of $34.00 so 5 + 34.00 = $39.00 for the total order. The answer is 39.
