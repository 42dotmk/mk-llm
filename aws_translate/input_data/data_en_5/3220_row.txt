[Question]Lauryn owns a computer company that employs men and women in different positions in the company. How many men does he employ if there are 20 fewer men than women and 180 people working for Lauryn?
[Answer]Let's say the number of men working at the company is x. Since there are 180 people, and the number of men is 20 fewer than the number of women, then x + x + 20 = 180. The total number of employees in the company is 2x + 20 = 180. 2x = 180 - 20. 2x = 160. The number of men is x = 160 / 2. There are x = 80 men in the company. The answer is 80.
Q: Kenny played 10 hours of basketball last week. He ran for twice as long as he played basketball, and he practiced on the trumpet for twice as long as he ran. How many hours did Kenny practice on the trumpet last week?
A: Kenny ran for 10 * 2 = 20 hours. Kenny practiced the trumpet for 20 * 2 = 40 hours. The answer is 40.
Question: Susan had a sum of money. She spent 1/5 of it in September, 1/4 of it in October, and $120 in November. After spending these amounts of money, she still had $540 left. How much money did she have at first?
Answer: Let X be the amount Susan had originally. Susan spent 1 / 5 * X in September, 1 / 4 * X in October, and $120 in November. Susan has X - 1 / 5 * X - 1 / 4 * X - $120 = $540 left. Combining like terms, we get 11 / 20 * X - $120 = $540. Adding $120 to both sides, we get 11 / 20 * X = $660. Dividing both sides by 11 / 20 we get X = $1200. The answer is 1200.
[Question]James won a money prize at a charity raffle. He donated half of his winnings back to the charity, then spent $2 on a hot dog to celebrate his win. He had $55 left over. How many dollars did he win?
[Answer]Let W be equal to Jamesâ€™s raffle winnings. He donated half his winnings, so he had W - W / 2 = W / 2 left. He then spent $2 on a hot dog, so W / 2 - 2 = $55. Thus, half his winnings is W / 2 = 55 + 2 = 57. James won W = 57 * 2 = $114. The answer is 114.
Q: Hugo can fold a small box in 3 seconds and a medium one in twice that time. Tom can fold both the small and medium boxes in 4 seconds. If Hugo and Tom want to leave as early as possible, how long (in seconds) will it take them to fold 2400 small boxes and 1800 medium boxes?
A: If it takes Hugo twice the amount of time to fold a medium box than a small box, then he needs 2 * 3 = 6 seconds for the medium box. If Tom can fold either the small or medium box in 4 seconds, then he's faster at folding the medium box than Hugo because 4s < 6s. If Hugo can fold the small box in 3 seconds, then he's faster at folding the small boxes than Tom because 3s < 4s. Therefore Hugo should fold all small boxes and Tom should fold all the medium ones before doing the other size where they are slower. If there are 2400 small boxes and Hugo can fold 1 box in 3 seconds, then it would take him 2400 * 3 = 7200 seconds to fold all boxes. If there are 1800 medium boxes and Tom can fold 1 box in 4 seconds, then it would take him 1800 * 4 = 7200 seconds to fold all medium boxes. Given that they need the same amount of time to fold all boxes, and are doing it simultaneously they will need 7200 seconds to fold all the boxes. The answer is 7200.
