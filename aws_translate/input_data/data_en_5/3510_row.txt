Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) are urging the United States to deepen its security cooperation and political support for a reliable and loyal ally. Over the years, the Kurdish Peshmerga forces have demonstrated their capabilities and dedication in the fight against ISIS, often serving as the front line in both Iraq and Syria. A closer American-Kurdish partnership could significantly enhance the collective effort to counter and defeat the extremist group.

In light of recent events, the United States should reconsider its previous stance of hesitance in forging a direct alliance with the Kurdish armed forces. The ongoing partnership between the KRG, regional partners, and other NATO member countries such as France and Germany has displayed the crucial role that the Kurds can play in promoting regional stability and effectively combating terrorist threats. Additionally, Washington's direct engagement with the Kurdish Peshmerga forces would send a strong signal to Iran, which has been trying to expand its influence in the region, that the United States is committed to preserving stability and preventing the spread of extremist ideologies in the Middle East.

To ensure the success of this partnership, the United States must be willing to provide financial, technical, and logistical support for the Kurdish forces, as well as ongoing training and assistance in order to enhance their capabilities on the battlefield. This strategic investment would benefit both the United States and the Iraqi Kurds, as it would enable the latter to better defend their territory while also reducing the need for American military presence in the region.

Furthermore, a renewed and strengthened American-Kurdish alliance should include support for the ongoing democratic development of the KRG, particularly in the areas of governance, rule of law, and civil society. By assisting the KRG in these areas and fostering an environment in which the Kurds can continue their journey toward self-rule and regional autonomy, the United States can contribute to the stabilization of Iraq and the broader Middle East. This will help create a more secure and prosperous environment in the region, providing greater opportunities for diplomacy, trade, and cooperation between the various players.

Recognizing that the challenges faced by the Kurds cannot be addressed by military means alone, as part of the enhanced partnership, the United States should also facilitate political dialogue between Erbil and Baghdad, encouraging the resolution of longstanding disputes over territories, natural resources, and constitutional issues. This would further contribute to Iraq's overall stability and unity and serve the long-term interests of the United States in the region.

In conclusion, President Obama's strategy to combat ISIS must reconsider its previous reluctance to directly engage with the Iraqi Kurds and recognize the significant potential benefits that a deeper partnership with the Peshmerga forces and the KRG can bring to the fight. By providing support and promoting democratic development in the KRG, the United States can help safeguard a key ally in the ongoing battle against extremism, ensure regional stability, and demonstrate its unwavering commitment to the democratic principles and values that both nations share.
