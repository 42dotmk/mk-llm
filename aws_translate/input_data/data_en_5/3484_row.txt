LONDON, England (CNN) -- His demonic face has stared maniacally from the cover of every Iron Maiden album since they released their first LP in 1980. Derek Riggs' favorite image of Eddie, as a clairvoyant, "because it's so completely manic." Edward T. Head, better known as Eddie, is a former theater mask who over 30 years has grown a body and morphed into the most recognized member of the band. In the Seventies, he was skull that sat above the drummer. "It had flashing red eyes and it would spew out this funny stuff and fake blood all over him," recalls drummer Nicko McBrain.

The picture was unclaimed for a year and a half before
