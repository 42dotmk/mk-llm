[Question]Max works for a delivery company as a courier. During one working day, he can deliver a maximum of 35 packages. One week, Max delivered the maximum number of packages, only twice. On two other days, Max unloaded a total of 50 packages, and on one day he unloaded only one-seventh of the maximum possible daily performance. On the last two days, the sum of the packages transported was only fourth-fifth of the maximum daily performance. How many more packages could Max deliver during that week, if he would work at maximum performance?
[Answer]Max can deliver a maximum of 35 * 7 = 245 packages in one week. For two days Max has carried the maximum number of packages, which in total means 2 * 35 = 70 packages. One day Max has carried only 1 / 7 of the maximum capacity, that is 1 / 7 * 35 = 5 packages. On two other days, Max delivered only 4 / 5 * 35 = 28 packages. That means, Max could deliver 245 - 28 - 5 - 70 - 50 = 92 more packages. The answer is 92.
Q: The flowers cost $9, the clay pot costs $20 more than the flower, and the bag of soil costs $2 less than the flower. How much does it cost to plant the flowers?
A: The clay pot costs $20 + $9 = $29. The bag of soil costs $9 - $2 = $7. The cost to plant the flowers is $9 + $29 + $7 = $45. The answer is 45.
Question: Andy is a lawyer who's working on two lawsuits. The first lawsuit has a 30% chance of paying out $5,000,000 upon a win and $0 if he loses it. The second lawsuit has a 50% chance of paying out $1,000,000 if Andy loses and a 50% chance of paying out $2,000,000 if he wins. Expressed as a percentage, how much more likely is it that Andy loses both lawsuits compared to winning both of them?
Answer: First find the probability that Andy will lose the first lawsuit: 100% - 30% = 70%. Then multiply that probability by the probability he loses the second lawsuit: 70% * 50% = 35%. Then multiply the probabilities of Andy winning each lawsuit to find the probability he wins them both: 30% * 50% = 15%. Then subtract the probability Andy wins both lawsuits from the probability he loses both lawsuits to find the difference: 35% - 15% = 20%. The answer is 20.
[Question]It's Ava's birthday party. Her parents bought a unicorn piñata for $13 and filled it with all of her favorite treats. They bought 4 bags of Reese's for $9 per bag, 3 bags of Snickers for $5 per bag, and 5 bags of Skittles for $7 per bag. How much did the unicorn piñata and the treats cost altogether?
[Answer]The four bags of Reese's cost $9 x 4 = $36. The three bags of Snickers cost $5 x 3 = $15. The five bags of Skittles cost $7 x 5 = $35. Therefore, the unicorn piñata and the treats cost $13 + $36 + $15 + $35 = $99. The answer is 99.
Q: A park is 1000 feet long and 2000 feet wide. If there is 1 tree per 20 square feet, how many trees are there in the park?
A: The park is 2,000,000 square feet because 1000 * 2000 = 2,000,000. Thus, there are 100,000 trees in the park because 2,000,000 / 20 = 100,000. The answer is 100000.
