Question: Whitney’s mom gave her two $20 bills to spend at the school book fair. Whitney has decided to buy 2 posters, 3 notebooks, and 2 bookmarks. Each poster costs $5, each notebook costs $4, and each bookmark costs $2. How much money, in dollars, will Whitney have left over after the purchase?
Answer: Whitney is buying 2 posters for $5 each, so the posters will cost 2 * $5 = $10 total cost for posters. Whitney is buying 3 notebooks for $4 each, so the notebooks will cost 3 * $4 = $12 total cost for notebooks. Whitney is buying 2 notebooks for $2, so the bookmarks 2 * $2 = $4 total cost for bookmarks. Since Whitney is paying $10 for posters, $12 for notebooks, and $4 for bookmarks, her total purchase will cost $10 + $12 + $4 = $26 total purchase cost. Whitney’s mom gave her 2 $20 bills, so she will be paying with 2 * $20 = $40 total payment. Since Whitney is paying with $40 and her purchase cost will be $26, she will have $40 - $26 = $14 left over after the purchase. The answer is 14.
[Question]There were 600 people in the stadium when the football game started. Before the game was over, one-fourth of the boys and one-eighth of the girls left early. How many people remained to see the end of the game if there were 240 girls at the beginning of the game?
[Answer]There were 600 - 240 = 360 boys at the beginning of the game. So, 360 x 1 / 4 = 90 boys left early. And 240 x 1 / 8 = 30 girls left early. A total of 90 + 30 = 120 people left early. Therefore, 600 - 120 = 480 people remained to see the end of the game. The answer is 480.
Q: Keaton climbed a 30 feet ladder twenty times while working at the construction site. Reece, also working at the same site, climbed a ladder 4 feet shorter than Keaton's ladder 15 times. What's the total length of the ladders that both workers climbed in inches?
A: If Keaton climbed his ladder twenty times, he covered a length of 30 * 20 = 600 feet. Reece's ladder, 4 feet shorter than Keaton's ladder, was 30 - 4 = 26 feet long. If Reece climbed the ladder 15 times, he covered a length of 15 * 26 = 390 feet. Keaton and Reece's total length covered while climbing the ladders is 390 + 600 = 990 feet. Since one foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length they climbed the ladders in inches is 12 * 990 = 11880 inches. The answer is 11880.
Question: Brenda picks 250 peaches. When she sorts through them, only 60% are fresh, and Brenda has to throw 15 away for being too small. How many peaches does Brenda have left?
Answer: First find how many of the peaches are fresh, which is 250 peaches * 60% = 150 peaches. Then, subtract the number Brenda throws away after the fresh count, which is 150 peaches - 15 peaches = 135 peaches. The answer is 135.
[Question]Ben's hockey team is 60% boys and the rest are girls. Half the girls are juniors and the other half are seniors. If the team has 50 players, how many junior girls are there?
[Answer]The team is 40% girls because 100 - 60 = 40. The team has 20 girls because 50 x .4 = 20. The team has 10 junior girls because 20 / 2 = 10. The answer is 10.
