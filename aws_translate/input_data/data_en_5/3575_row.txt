Lisa had confided in them about her troubled marriage and her fears for her own safety. She had confided in Amy, a seasoned journalist, known for her empathetic nature when dealing with cases involving missing persons. Amy had covered many high-profile stories where families had struggled with the aftermath of the inexplicable absence of their loved ones. Amy's approach towards the Stebics had always been professional, and she had interviewed Lisa's friends and family members extensively in an attempt to keep the public's attention on the missing mother of two.

Unbeknownst to Amy, a fellow reporter from the local CBS station had received an invitation to the same pool party by another guest at the gathering. The reporter had managed to capture Amy on video at the event, wearing a bikini and seemingly enjoying herself. The footage quickly made its rounds on local and national news, along with various social media platforms, tainting Amy's image as a serious journalist.

Consequently, Amy's credibility as a journalist was put into question, and she subsequently lost her job at the NBC affiliate. She decided to file a libel lawsuit against the CBS station, claiming that the footage was taken out of context and had unfairly portrayed her as unprofessional, damaging her reputation as a dedicated journalist.

During the course of the trial, Amy's legal team presented evidence showing that she had been working diligently on the Lisa Stebic case, had multiple off-camera interviews with those close to the family, and had attended several press conferences raising awareness for her disappearance. They sought to demonstrate that the pool party was an informal social gathering with people from the neighborhood, arguing that it was her attempt to build rapport and gather more information about the case in a less formal setting.

Moreover, Amy testified that she had been invited to the party by one of Lisa's friends, who believed she should be present in order to speak with Craig and glean new leads on Lisa's whereabouts. The prosecution, on the other hand, argued that the footage spoke for itself and that Amy's presence at the party in a bikini was unprofessional and inappropriate, given the sensitive nature of the case.

In the end, the jury on the libel case found in favor of the CBS station, stating that although Amy's journalistic integrity was not put into question, her decision to attend the pool party in a bikini and the subsequent fallout that followed was a consequence of the choices she made of her own free will.  

Following the conclusion of the lawsuit, Amy expressed her disappointment with the ruling and reiterated her dedication to her reporting career. She said that even though the outcome was unfavorable, she would continue to advocate for missing persons, such as Lisa Stebic, and seek justice for their families.

In the years following the lawsuit, Amy went on to work at a smaller news outlet, where she has continued to focus on uncovering the truth about unsolved cases. Despite the painful setback in her career, she remains driven by her commitment to giving a voice to the voiceless and standing up for those who are no longer here to stand up for themselves. As for the case of Lisa Stebic, it remains unsolved, with her family and friends continuing their search for answers.
