A room fire can be divided into various phases. 

Throughout the development of a room fire, distinct phases can be identified as the fire evolves from ignition to a fully developed fire and finally either self-extinguishes or is suppressed. Each of these phases plays a crucial role in affecting the entire fire process, and understanding them can aid in fighting fires, minimizing damage, and ensuring the safety of occupants and firefighters. Here are the primary phases of a room fire:

1. Incipient Phase or Ignition: This is the initial phase when the fire is relatively small and localized. It begins with the ignition of the combustible materials present in the room due to a heat source, a chemical reaction, or electrical malfunction. During this phase, the fire produces a small amount of heat and smoke, and if detected and suppressed early, it can prevent the fire from growing and causing more extensive damages.

2. Growth Phase: The fire starts to grow rapidly during this phase due to increased heat production and the involvement of additional combustible materials. The thermal layering of hot gas and smoke begins to develop under the ceiling, gradually reducing the visibility in the room. As the room temperature increases, convection currents cause the fire to spread to other parts of the room, involving more materials and surfaces.

3. Flashover: This phase is a critical turning point in a room fire because it represents the moment when the majority of combustible materials within the room become involved simultaneously. The entire room, or most of it, becomes engulfed in fire, making it extremely dangerous for occupants and firefighters. This is due to a combination of factors, including high temperatures, high levels of radiant heat flux, and an increased concentration of combustible gases. The flashover phase is often accompanied by a rapid increase in fire intensity and a significant expansion of the fire's size.

4. Fully Developed Phase: In this phase, the fire has reached its maximum size and intensity, consuming all available oxygen and fuel within the room. The temperature within the room becomes very high, and structural components may begin to fail, posing a significant risk to those in the vicinity. In case of interconnected rooms or buildings, the fire may spread to adjoining areas, causing the development of additional fires or flashovers in those spaces.

5. Decay Phase: The fire begins to diminish during this phase. This could be due to the consumption of available fuel and oxygen, the interventions taken by firefighters, or a combination of both factors. As the fire starts to lose intensity, the room temperature starts to drop, and the flames begin to retreat. During this phase, the production of smoke and toxic gases starts to decrease.

Understanding these various phases of a room fire is essential for implementing appropriate fire prevention and protection measures, predicting fire behavior, and training firefighters and other emergency personnel. Properly designed fire detection and suppression systems, along with solid building construction and fire-resistant materials, can help to slow down or stop the progression through these phases, thus allowing more time for occupants to escape and firefighters to suppress the fire effectively.
