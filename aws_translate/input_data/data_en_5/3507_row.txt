Question: Betty is growing parsnips in her vegetable garden. When the parsnips are grown, they are harvested and bundled into boxes that can hold up to 20 parsnips each. Each harvest, three-quarters of the boxes are full, and the remaining boxes are half-full. She gets an average of 20 boxes each harvest. How many parsnips does Betty grow in an average harvest?
Answer: If three - quarters of the boxes are full, then 1 – ¾ = ¼ of the boxes are half - full. On average, each harvest therefore has 20 boxes * 0.25 = 5 boxes that are half - full. This leaves 20 total boxes – 5 half - full boxes = 15 full boxes. Half - full boxes hold 20 parsnips / 2 = 10 parsnips each. In total, the half - full boxes, therefore, hold 5 boxes * 10 parsnips = 50 parsnips. The full boxes hold a total of 15 boxes * 20 parsnips = 300 parsnips. So Betty harvests a total of 50 + 300 = 350 parsnips in an average harvest. The answer is 350.

Question: Joseph has a refrigerator, a water heater in his house, and an electric oven that consumes power at different rates. The total amount of money that Joseph pays for the energy used by the refrigerator is three times the amount he pays for the power used by the water heater. If the electric oven uses power worth $500 in a month, twice what Joseph pays for the power the water heater uses, calculate the total amount he pays for the power used by these gadgets.
Answer: If the electric oven uses power worth $500 in a month, twice what Joseph pays for the power the water heater uses, Joseph pays 1 / 2 * $500 = $250 for power used by the water heater. The total amount of money that Joseph pays for the power used by the water heater and the electric oven is $250 + $500 = $750. The total amount of money that Joseph pays for the energy used by the refrigerator is three times the amount he pays for the power used by the water heater, a total of 3 * $250 = $750. For the three gadgets, Joseph pays $750 + $750 = $1500 for the power they use. The answer is 1500.
[Question]At 30, Anika is 4/3 the age of Maddie. What would be their average age in 15 years?
[Answer]If Anika is 30 now, in 15 years, she'll be 30 + 15 = 45 years old. At 30, Anika is 4 / 3 the age of Maddie, meaning Maddie is 4 / 3 * 30 = 40 years. In 15 years, Maddie will be 40 + 15 = 55 years old. Their total age in 15 years will be 55 + 45 = 100. Their average age in 15 years will be 100 / 2 = 50. The answer is 50.
