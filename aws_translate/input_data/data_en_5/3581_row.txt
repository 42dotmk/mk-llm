A landed immigrant in Canada refers to an individual who has been granted the status of a permanent resident but is not yet a citizen. A permanent resident is someone who has been granted the permission to live and work in Canada indefinitely while still being a citizen of another country. This term has largely been replaced by the term "permanent resident," but some people still use "landed immigrant" to describe the same status.

As a landed immigrant or permanent resident, a person is entitled to many of the same rights, privileges, and responsibilities as Canadian citizens, with some exceptions. Here are the key aspects of being a landed immigrant in Canada:

1. Right to work: Landed immigrants have the right to work for any employer in Canada, both in the private and public sectors. They can also work for federal or provincial governments, albeit with some access restrictions to certain regulated professions.

2. Right to healthcare: Landed immigrants are eligible for government-funded healthcare benefits, similar to those enjoyed by Canadian citizens.

3. Social benefits: Landed immigrants have access to the same social benefits as Canadian citizens, such as Child Tax Benefits, Old Age Security, and Guaranteed Income Supplement.

4. Legal rights: Landed immigrants in Canada have the same legal rights as Canadian citizens, including the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, the right to a fair trial, and the right to be protected against unreasonable searches and seizures.

5. Education: Landed immigrants have access to publicly funded education systems, from kindergarten to post-secondary institutions, at subsidized or local rates, without any restrictions.

6. Mobility: Landed immigrants can freely move within Canada, work, and reside in any Canadian province or territory. They can also leave and re-enter the country without any restrictions, as long as they maintain their permanent resident status.

However, there are certain differences between landed immigrants and Canadian citizens:

1. Voting: Landed immigrants do not have the right to vote in federal, provincial, or municipal elections in Canada. They must first become Canadian citizens to gain voting rights.

2. Running for political office: Landed immigrants are not eligible to run for elected office in federal, provincial, or municipal governments in Canada.

3. Holding certain government positions: Landed immigrants cannot hold high-level government positions that require Canadian citizenship or security clearances, such as jobs in national security or intelligence agencies.

4. Citizenship: Landed immigrants are not Canadian citizens and cannot apply for or hold a Canadian passport. However, they can apply for Canadian citizenship after meeting specific residency requirements and other criteria.

In summary, a landed immigrant in Canada refers to a person who has been granted permanent residency status, allowing them to live, work, and enjoy many benefits similar to Canadian citizens while still being a citizen of another country. This term is largely interchangeable with "permanent resident," and individuals with this status have several rights and responsibilities in Canada but may not vote, run for elected office, or hold certain high-level government positions until they become Canadian citizens.
