Title: Sixteen Turkish Construction Workers Freed After Abduction in Baghdad

Introduction:
In a series of events that brought relief to Turkey and the families of the victims, sixteen Turkish construction workers, who had been abducted a month ago in the Iraqi capital city of Baghdad, were recently released. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu confirmed the news, stating that the previously kidnapped workers were finally freed and are in good health.

Background of the kidnapping:
The abduction took place on September 2, 2015, when a group of unknown armed militants stormed the construction site where the workers were stationed. The workers were employed by Nurol Insaat, a Turkish construction firm contracted to build a sports stadium in the city and were being held hostage at an unknown location in Iraq. The militants initially demanded the release of their associates held in Turkish jails as well as stopping the flow of Turkish shipments of arms and supplies to factions in Iraq that confronted the extremist groups. However, the specific identity of the extremist group responsible for the kidnapping remained unknown throughout the ordeal.

Turkish Government's efforts:
After the abduction came to light, the Turkish government initiated efforts to secure the release of its citizens. The government authorities at both Turkey and Iraq's diplomatic missions maintained contact throughout the hostage situation. The two countries cooperated by closely monitoring the situation and sharing intelligence data to ensure that the hostages were safely located and released. Turkish intelligence organization MIT (Milli Istihbarat Teskilati) played a crucial role in the release of the workers.

The Release:
The workers were released at an unknown location in Iraq after the Turkish authorities successfully fulfilled the abductors' demands. Although the specifics of the release deal have not been disclosed, it is believed that negotiations between the Turkish government and the kidnappers positively impacted the outcome. The construction workers were found in good health and are now being transported to Turkey.

Impact on Turkish-Iraqi relations:
The successful release of the kidnapped workers signifies a milestone in Turkish-Iraqi relations, indicating a strengthening of diplomatic and intelligence cooperation between the two countries. The incident further highlights the need for these nations to collaborate in the ongoing battle against extremist groups in the region. The release of the workers has also boosted Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu's reputation amongst the Turkish people, demonstrating his government's ability to secure the safety of its citizens abroad.

In conclusion, the release of the sixteen Turkish construction workers abducted in Baghdad marks a positive development in the ongoing fight against extremist groups in the Middle East. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of collaboration between nations and enhances regional cooperation between Turkey and Iraq in ensuring the safety and security of their citizens. As the issue of kidnappings conducted by militant organizations remains a genuine concern globally, the successful outcome of this situation provides hope for a proactive, cooperative approach in tackling these issues in the future.
