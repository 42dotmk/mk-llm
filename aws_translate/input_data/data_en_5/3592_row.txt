The dictator gained power of the other country by using tanks rather than planes because the tanks were advanced. The decision to opt for tanks instead of planes was a strategic move that played a critical role in the successful takeover of the neighboring nation. In fact, the increased capabilities in tank technology allowed the dictator to effectively employ land forces, dominate the battlefield and swiftly topple the opposing forces.

There are several reasons behind the choice of advanced tanks over advanced planes.

1. Terrain dominance: One of the biggest factors was the reinforcement of ground supremacy that advanced tanks provided. By using tanks, the dictator was able to control and dominate strategic land-based positions, which offered significant advantages over air power alone. With tanks on the ground, the military had the capability to directly secure resources, key cities, and hold essential territory. In contrast, air power often has limited persistence and engagement at the ground level.

2. Resilience to defenses: While advanced planes undoubtedly have their own merits, they are typically more vulnerable to ground defenses and anti-air systems operated by the defending nation. The dictator deemed that tanks, with their enhanced armor and reinforced designs, could better withstand the enemy's anti-tank assets, and thus offered a better chance at victory. In addition, due to the low altitude trajectory of tanks, they tend to maintain a higher level of stealth on the battlefield, evading early detection and enemy counters.

3. Logistics and transportation: The use of tanks also provided the dictator's forces with increased logistical capabilities, as they could be easily transported via rail or carrier systems into the targeted nation. In contrast, air deployments would have required much more extensive preparations, including arranging airfield locations, refueling stops, and added maintenance needs.

4. Infantry support: Another benefit of implementing advanced tanks was their compatibility with infantry forces. Tanks are designed to not only serve as powerful offensive weapons but also to protect and provide support to infantry troops. This cooperation between tanks and infantry is critical for maintaining momentum in land warfare, whereas planes often struggle to offer the same level of support.

5. Psychological impact: The sight of a large and menacing line of advanced tanks advancing towards a city or base has a significant impact on enemy morale. The psychological effect of tanks can be intimidating, ultimately leading to a decrease in enemy resistance and quicker capitulations. Planes, on the other hand, tend to have a less immediate impact on morale due to their rapidly shifting positions and temporary presence on the battlefield.

At the end of the day, the dictator's choice of advanced tanks over planes in the conquest of the neighboring country demonstrated a strategic understanding of the resources at hand and a practical execution on the battlefield. The advanced tank technology proved to be a highly effective way to exert control, bolster the advancing forces, and instill fear in the hearts of any opposing factions. As a result, the dictator was able to successfully take control of the targeted nation, solidifying their power in the region and beyond.
