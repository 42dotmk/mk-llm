John Fitzgerald Kennedy, commonly known as JFK, was the president of the United States during the Bay of Pigs Invasion. JFK was the 35th president, serving from January 20, 1961, until his assassination on November 22, 1963. He was a member of the Democratic Party and was the youngest president ever elected to office at the age of 43.

The Bay of Pigs Invasion, also known as "La Batalla de Giron" in Cuba or "Operaci√≥n Pluto" in the United States, took place between April 17th and April 19th, 1961. This unsuccessful military intervention in Cuba was a covert operation initiated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during JFK's administration, with the objective of overthrowing the communist government of Fidel Castro. While Kennedy was not the architect of the invasion plan, it proceeded under his watch, and he shouldered the blame for its failure.

The roots of this invasion plan can be traced back to the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The United States had grown increasingly concerned with Castro's close ties to the Soviet Union and the spread of communism in the Western Hemisphere, prompting Eisenhower to approve a plan in March 1960 to train Cuban exiles for an armed invasion of Cuba. When Kennedy assumed presidency, he allowed the plan to go forward, albeit with some modifications.

The operation involved the CIA training and equipping a group of approximately 1,400 Cuban exiles (known as Brigade 2506) in Guatemala. These exiles were trained in various aspects of unconventional warfare. Their mission was to create initial beachheads in the southern coast of Cuba, specifically at the Bay of Pigs area in the Zapata Swamp region. From there, they were supposed to capture key targets, rally anti-Castro forces, and form a provisional government that would take control of the island.

The invasion was a disaster from the outset. The operation faced a series of logistical and intelligence failures. Cuban forces had been alerted to the impending attack, and JFK's administration had scaled back air support, allowing the Cuban Air Force to maintain air superiority. Additionally, the amphibious landing site chosen for the invasion proved to be poorly suited, as it was surrounded by swampy terrain, providing no easy escape routes for the invading forces.

As a result, the invading forces faced fierce resistance from Cuban troops, who easily repelled the invasion. Within three days, the members of Brigade 2506 were either killed or captured, with over 100 killed and over 1,000 taken as prisoners. The failed invasion led to further deterioration of US-Cuban relations and heightened tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. President Kennedy accepted responsibility for the failure, stating in a press conference that "victory has a hundred fathers, but defeat is an orphan."

The Bay of Pigs Invasion had a significant impact on Kennedy's domestic and foreign policy. It led to increased distrust towards the CIA, and Kennedy reevaluated the role of military advisors in his administration. Despite the failure at the Bay of Pigs, JFK remained committed to containing the spread of communism, and it resulted in decisions like supporting the Cuban Missile Crisis blockade and increasing involvement in the Vietnam War.
