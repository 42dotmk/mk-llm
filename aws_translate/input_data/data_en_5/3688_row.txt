Subject: WestLB: Restructured Company Updates and Future Opportunities

Dear [Recipient Name],

I hope this email finds you in high spirits and good health. I am reaching out to provide an important update regarding WestLB or Westdeutsche Landesbank, previously one of Germany's top public banks, and its latest developments since the restructuring process occurred a few years ago. Furthermore, I am excited to announce some of the new opportunities presented by its successor organizations, and how our valued partners can benefit from them.

As you may recall, WestLB experienced financial difficulties during the worldwide economic crisis, with the European Commission ordering its restructuring in 2012. Subsequently, the bank underwent significant transformations, which led to the establishment of two separate entities, Portigon AG and ERGO Trust GmbH, to consolidate the operations. This event had a profound impact on the financial competitive landscape, and I want to ensure that you are informed of the latest details concerning these entities.

Portigon AG now performs most of the former roles of WestLB's financial services, excluding the banking operations. This company provides a wide range of services, including risk management, IT services, real estate management, and back-office support. Despite operating on a relatively smaller scale than before, Portigon AG still prioritizes service quality and client satisfaction, sharply focusing on meeting the current needs and mitigating risks while considering future industry trends.

ERGO Trust GmbH, on the other hand, has taken a more specialized stance in the banking sector. It is responsible for managing the assets of the former WestLB, particularly the NRW.BANK, which acts as Northern Westphalia's development bank. A state-owned entity, it channels financial resources into valuable projects and initiatives such as urban and rural development, environmental programs, infrastructure, and technological innovation. This approach puts ERGO Trust GmbH in a unique position to foster regional growth and expand opportunities across numerous sectors.

Now that you are up-to-date with the current state of affairs, I would like to invite you to participate in the upcoming webinar session "Embracing the Future: Opportunities with Portigon AG and ERGO Trust GmbH". The purpose of this virtual event is to explore and discuss the possibilities for collaboration between your organization and both Portigon AG and ERGO Trust GmbH to capitalize on their respective strengths and services. Our expert panel will also provide insights on the most promising sectors for growth and investment in the region, outlining the policy framework that supports these initiatives.

The webinar will take place on [Date] at [Time] and will last approximately [Length]. Attendance is free of charge, so I highly encourage you to share this invitation with your colleagues and peers who might benefit from the discussion.
