Q: Jerry takes 2 antacids that weigh 2 grams each and are 5% zinc by weight. Then he takes three more smaller antacids that weigh 1 gram each and have 15% zinc. How many milligrams of zinc does he eat?
A: First find the total weight of the big antacids: 2 grams / antacid * 2 antacids = 4 grams. Then convert that weight to milligrams: 4 grams * 1000 mg / gram = 4000 mg. Then multiply that number by 5% to find how much zinc is in the big antacids: 4000 mg * 5% = 200 mg. Then find the total weight of the smaller antacids in milligrams: 3 antacids * 1 gram / antacid * 1000 mg / gram = 3000 mg. Then multiply that number by the percent of zinc to find the amount of zinc in the small antacids: 3000 mg * 15% = 450 mg. Then add the zinc Jerry gets from each set of pills to find the total amount of zinc he eats: 450 mg + 200 mg = 650 mg. The answer is 650.

[Question]Mrs. Anderson bought 2 bags of 3-pound bag of cat food and another 2 bags of dog food that each weigh 2 more pounds than each bag of cat food. There are 16 ounces in each pound. How many ounces of pet food did Mrs. Anderson buy?
[Answer]The two bags of cat food weigh 2 x 3 = 6 pounds. Each bag of dog food weighs 3 + 2 = 5 pounds. So two bags of dog food weigh 2 x 5 = 10 pounds. Thus, Mrs. Anderson bought 6 + 10 = 16 pounds of pet food. And 16 pounds is equal to 16 x 16 = 256 ounces. The answer is 256.
Q: Janessa has a plan to give her brother Dexter his first collection of baseball cards. She currently has 4 cards in addition to the 13 that her father gave her. She ordered a collection of 36 cards from eBay. After inspecting the cards she found 4 cards are in bad shape and decides to throw them away. Janessa ended up giving Dexter 29 cards. How many cards did Janessa keep for herself?
A: Janessa starts with 4 cards + 13 cards = 17 cards. She adds 17 cards + 36 cards = 53 cards from the eBay purchase. Janessa decides to throw away 53 cards - 4 cards = 49 cards due to damage. After giving Dexter the present we know that Janessa kept 49 cards - 29 cards = 20 cards for herself. The answer is 20.
Question: Jane, Kyla, and Anthony have summer jobs in a resort. Their task is to fold guests' towels. Jane can fold 3 towels in 5 minutes. Kyla can fold 5 towels in 10 minutes, and Anthony can fold 7 towels in 20 minutes. If they all fold towels together, how many towels can they fold in one hour?
Answer: There are 1 x 60 minutes = 60 minutes in 1 hour. There are 60 / 5 = 12 sets of 5 minutes in 1 hour. So, Jane can fold 3 x 12 = 36 towels in an hour. There are 60 / 10 = 6 sets of 10 minutes in 1 hour. So, Kyla can fold 5 x 6 = 30 towels in an hour. There are 60 / 20 = 3 sets of 20 minutes in 1 hour. So, Anthony can fold 7 x 3 = 21 towels in an hour. Therefore, the 3 of them can fold a total of 36 + 30 + 21 = 87 towels in 1 hour. The answer is 87.
