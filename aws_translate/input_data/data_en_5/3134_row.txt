[Question]Tom spends $250 to buy gems in a game he plays. The game gives 100 gems for each dollar you spend. Since he bought so many gems he got a 20% bonus of more gems. How many gems did he end up with?
[Answer]He bought 250 * 100 = 25000 gems. He got a 25,000 * .2 = 5,000 gem bonus. So he got a total of 25000 + 5000 = 30,000 gems. The answer is 30000.
Q: Ms. Mitsuko told the class that if the average score on their quiz is higher than 75% then they will get a pizza party. There are 25 students in the class. One student is absent and has to take the test the next day. The average score of the students who took the test was 77%. What is the lowest grade the absent student can get for the class to still get a pizza party?
A: The total percentage the class needs to get is 18.75 because 25 x .75 = 18.75. The total percentage the class has absent the one student is 18.48. The lowest the absent student can get and still have a pizza party is 27% because (18.75 - 18.48)x 100 = 27. The answer is 27.
Question: Janet is trying to decide whether to quit her job and start freelancing. She works 40 hours a week at both jobs. She get paid $30/hour at her current job, and would get paid $40/hour as a freelancer. However, she'd have to pay an extra $25 a week in FICA taxes plus $400/month in healthcare premiums. How much more would Janet make per month as a freelancer if there are four weeks in a month?
Answer: First find the difference in hourly wages: $40 / hour - $30 / hour = $10 / hour. Then multiply that difference by the number of hours she works in a week to find the weekly difference: $10 / hour * 40 hours / week = $400 / week. Then multiply that amount by the number of weeks in a month to find the monthly difference in her earnings: $400 / week * 4 weeks / month = $1600 / month. Then find the total additional amount Janet pays in FICA taxes: $25 / week * 4 weeks / month = $100 / month. Then subtract Janet's extra FICA taxes and healthcare premium from the additional money she earns to find the net increase in her pay from freelancing: $1600 / month - $400 / month - $100 / month = $1100 / month. The answer is 1100.
[Question]To keep himself busy in class, Michael makes rubber-band balls. He makes two sizes, large and small. A small ball uses 50 rubber bands. A large ball requires 300 rubber bands. Michael brought a 5,000 pack to class and already made 22 small balls. How many large balls can he make with the remaining rubber bands?
[Answer]Michael has used 1,100 rubber bands because 22 x 50 = 1,100. Michael has 3,900 rubber bands remaining because 5,000 - 1,100 = 3,900. Michael can make 13 large balls because 3,900 / 300 = 13. The answer is 13.
