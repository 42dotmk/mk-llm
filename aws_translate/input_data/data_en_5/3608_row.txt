Genre: Thriller / Horror

Plot Summary:
In the remote, mountainous region of Northridge, a small group of adventurous friends set out on a weekend road trip to explore a long-abandoned cabin rumored to contain hidden treasure. Unbeknownst to them, they are driving straight into the heart of a terrifying mystery; a monstrous and vengeful bear is on the loose, attacking and destroying anything in its path.

Plot:
Act 1: 
The film opens in the vibrant city of Goldwell, where five friends - Michael, Sarah, Alex, Jess, and Brian - plan an exciting weekend getaway to explore a forgotten cabin that once belonged to a wealthy family, the Whitmores. According to local myths, a fortune in gold and precious stones lies hidden within the cabin's walls, waiting to be uncovered. The group load up their trusty SUV and embark on the journey, filled with anticipation.

Act 2: 
As they make their way through the breathtaking Northridge Mountains, what should have been a leisurely drive takes a tragic turn. They come across a flipped car with its doors ripped apart, and the passengers nowhere to be seen. The friends grow increasingly wary, noticing the unmistakable signs of a vicious attack.

Barely managing to continue on their quest, they reach the disheveled cabin, which is nestled deep within the forest. As they split up to investigate different parts of the cabin and its surroundings, the first mysterious attack occurs, with Alex discovering strange, large claw marks on their SUV.

Act 3:
A piercing roar echoes through the woods, and the friends regroup, but now they are trapped, unable to leave on their disabled vehicle. Night falls, and it becomes increasingly clear that they are being stalked by a cunning and relentless predator - a gigantic, malevolent bear that seeks vengeance for the cruel poaching of its family.

While the group huddles inside the cabin, they discover old journals belonging to the Whitmore family. The secrets within reveal that the family had long been involved in illegal animal trafficking of bears. Overcome with remorse and a sense of responsibility, Michael shares his own dark secret: his late grandfather was the last surviving heir of the Whitmore family. Guilt-ridden and determined to atone, the group decides to fight back.

Act 4:
Armed with makeshift weapons, the desperate friends must rely on teamwork, strategy, and their own courage to outwit and defeat the bear, which itself is imbued with a supernatural force. After several harrowing encounters that test the friends' resolve, they finally manage to get the upper hand on the vengeful bear.

In a heart-stopping showdown, the bear is defeated, and the group narrowly survives, forever bonded by their harrowing experience.

Epilogue:
Weeks later, they return to the cabin to retrieve the hidden treasure. Instead of claiming it for themselves, they donate the wealth to wildlife preservation efforts, honoring the memory of the fallen bear and taking a stand against animal cruelty.

In "Bear Claw," the intense thriller meets heart-pounding horror as the audience experiences the undeniable power of the untamed wilderness and the importance of preserving nature's balance. The film serves as a chilling reminder of the consequences that await when humanity's greed violates the sanctity of the natural world.
