To answer these questions, I will first gather information about Jawahar Lal Nehru's role in the mentioned events, as well as Article 370 of the Constitution of India. Then, I will analyze the reasons why some of Nehru's actions are remembered differently. Finally, I will evaluate whether these questions are the same or not. 

Step 1: Gather Information

Jawahar Lal Nehru served as the first Prime Minister of independent India from 1947 to 1964. During his tenure, he faced various challenges, including the issues with China, Portugal, Hyderabad, Junagadh, and Kashmir.

1. Defeat against China: India faced a humiliating defeat in the 1962 Sino-Indian War under Nehru's leadership. This has left a lasting impression, and many Indians blame Nehru for India's unpreparedness and lack of military strategy.

2. Victory against Portugal: In 1961, India successfully annexed Goa, Daman and Diu, ending Portuguese colonial rule in the region. Nehru played a significant role in this event.

3. Police action in Hyderabad and Junagadh: Following India's independence, both Hyderabad and Junagadh acceded to India in 1948 after military intervention, often referred to as "police action." This intervention led to the integration of these territories within the Indian Union. Nehru played a crucial role in these decisions.

4. Saving 3/4th of Kashmir: In 1947, when Pakistan-backed forces attempted to take control of Kashmir, Nehru took a timely decision to send Indian troops into the region, saving a significant portion of Kashmir from being occupied by Pakistan. Thus, a large part of Kashmir remained with India.

5. Article 370: It is a constitutional provision that granted special autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir, allowing the state to have its own constitution, flag, and control over various administrative matters. The article was designed to respect the unique conditions and history of the region. It was abrogated in 2019.

Step 2: Analyze Reasons for Differences in Remembrance

1. The defeat against China had a higher impact on the psyche of the Indian population than the other events. Losing a war to a neighboring nation, especially a growing superpower like China, tends to be remembered more prominently in public memory.

2. Successes such as the victory against Portugal or the police action in Hyderabad and Junagadh are sometimes overshadowed by failures. Portugal was a relatively weaker opponent compared to China, and integrating princely states into the Indian Union was a relatively smooth process compared to the territorial disputes with a major power like China.

3. The India-China conflict remains an ongoing issue, while the issues with Portugal, Hyderabad, and Junagadh have been resolved. This means that the 1962 defeat still resonates in the current political climate.

Step 3: Evaluate if Questions are the Same

These questions are not the same as they address different aspects of Jawahar Lal Nehru's political career and decisions. The first question is about the public perception of Nehru's actions in various territorial conflicts, while the second question asks about the specifics of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution. However, both questions are related in that they pertain to different aspects of the history of modern India and the political decisions made during Nehru's tenure.
