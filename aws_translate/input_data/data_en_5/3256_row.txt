The statement "At the same time, it must be noted that the overwhelming majority of Muslims in India are Indian natives converted to Islam" does not directly answer the question "From where did raiders come to attack the agrarian Indians?" However, it does provide relevant information about the historical context of relations between Muslim and non-Muslim communities in India. To comprehensively answer the question, we need to delve deeper into the history of raids and invasions that affected the agrarian population of India.

From the early medieval period, India witnessed a series of invasions and raids from various external forces. The following are some of the prominent sources of raiders that targeted agrarian Indians throughout history:

1. The Indo-Greek raids (circa 180 BCE - 10 CE): The invasion of India by the Indo-Greek Kingdom, a part of the Hellenistic world, led to some of the earliest recorded raids on agrarian Indian lands. These invasions were mainly concentrated in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent.

2. The Scythians, Parthians, and Kushans (circa 2nd century BCE - 3rd century CE): Many central Asian tribes, including the Scythians (Sakas), Parthians (Pahlavas), and Kushans, made successive inroads into India. They raided agrarian regions and eventually established their respective dynasties on Indian soil.

3. The Hun invasions (circa 5th-6th century CE): The White Huns (also known as Hephthalites or Hunas) invaded the Indian subcontinent during the Gupta period. They attacked Indian agrarian settlements and inflicted significant damage on established administrative systems.

4. Arab incursions (circa 8th-10th century CE): Arab raiders and armies began attacking parts of India in the early medieval period following the Islamic Caliphate's expansion. Their raids targeted coastal areas, the Sindh region, and the northwestern frontiers of India.

5. Turkic and Afghan invasions (circa 11th-13th century CE): A series of invasions by Turkic and Afghan warlords, including Mahmud of Ghazni and Muhammad Ghori, severely affected large parts of northern and northwestern India. These invaders plundered the riches of urban centers and agrarian lands alike, leading to the emergence of the Delhi Sultanate.

6. Mongol invasions (circa 13th-14th century CE): Timur, the Turco-Mongol ruler, and other Mongol invaders launched a series of raids on northern and western India, targeting the Delhi Sultanate and agrarian hinterlands.

While these invasions and raids were carried out by different empires and rulers, they all targeted the Indian subcontinent with varying degrees of success. The statement in question pertains more to the conversion of the native Indian population to Islam over centuries, which occurred through several factors, including trade, migration, and cultural assimilation. The process of conversion and the invasions that exposed the Indian subcontinent to experiences of religious pluralism and cultural diversity have contributed to shaping the complex socio-religious landscape that we see in India today.

In conclusion, the statement does not directly answer the question about the origins of raiders, but by examining India's diverse history of invasions, we can better understand the context in which these events took place.
