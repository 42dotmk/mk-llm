Question: In a classroom there are 30 students. 1/3 of them are boys. Among the girls, 40% own dogs, 20% own a cat, and the rest have no pets. How many girls in the class have no pet?
Answer: 2 / 3 students are girls because 1 - (1 / 3) = 2 / 3. 20 students are girls because 30 x (2 / 3) = 20. 40% of the girls don't have any pets because 100 - 40 - 20 = 40. 8 girls in class have no pets because 20 x .4 = 8. The answer is 8.
[Question]An airline company owns 5 airplanes. Every airplane they own has 20 rows with 7 seats in each row. Each airplane makes 2 flights a day. How many passengers can the airline company accommodate each day?
[Answer]Each airplane has 20 x 7 = 140 seats. So, the 5 airplanes can accommodate a total of 140 x 5 = 700 passengers. Therefore, the airline company can accommodate 700 x 2 = 1400 passengers each day. The answer is 1400.
Q: Jimmy wants to play in the inflatable swimming pool in his backyard. The swimming pool is empty and the garage is locked, so he cannot use the hose to fill the pool. He finds a 2 gallon bucket and calculates that it takes 20 seconds to fill the bucket from the tap and carry it to the pool where he pours in the water. If the pool holds 84 gallons of water, how many minutes will it take Jimmy to fill the pool?
A: It will take 84 / 2 = 42 trips to fill the pool with water. This will take Jimmy 42 trips * 20 seconds per trip = 840 seconds. This means that Jimmy will spend 840 seconds * 1 minute / 60 seconds = 14 minutes filling the pool. The answer is 14.
Question: In a store, there are three types of cheese: white, swiss, and blue cheese. Each cheese is packaged, and there are 200 grams of cheese in each package. The package prices are $5 for white cheese, $6 for swiss cheese, and $8 for blue cheese. Miley needed to get some for her party, and she decided to buy 5 packs of swiss cheese, 600 grams of blue cheese, and one-third less white cheese. How much did she need to pay for all the cheese?
Answer: For the swiss cheese, Miley paid 5 * 6 = $30. 600 grams of blue cheese means 600 / 200 = 3 packages. So for the blue cheese, Miley paid 3 * 8 = $24. One - third of the blue cheese means 1 / 3 * 600 = 200 grams. So Miley bought only 600 - 200 = 400 grams of white cheese. Which means 400 / 200 = 2 packages. So for the white cheese, Miley paid 2 * 5 = $10. So in total for all the cheese, Miley paid 30 + 24 + 10 = $64. The answer is 64.
[Question]Julio makes a mocktail every evening. He uses 1 tablespoon of lime juice and tops with 1 cup of sparkling water.  He can usually squeeze 2 tablespoons of lime juice per lime. After 30 days, if limes are 3 for $1.00, how much will he have spent on limes?
[Answer]He uses 1 tablespoon of lime juice per drink so over 30 days that's 1 * 30 = 30 tablespoons of lime juice. He can get 2 tablespoons of lime juice per lime and he will use 30 tablespoons of lime juice so he will need 30 / 2 = 15 limes. The limes are 3 for $1.00 and he needs 15 limes so that's 15 / 3 = $5.00. The answer is 5.
