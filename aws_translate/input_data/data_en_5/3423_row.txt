Yes, the sentence "Salvation in Pāśupata involved the union of the soul with God through the intellect" does answer the question "For the Pasupatas, how was the union of the soul with God achieved?" However, it could be beneficial to provide a more detailed and comprehensive response to fully address the question.

The Pāśupata sect is one of the oldest and most influential Shaivite traditions within Hinduism, dating back to at least the 2nd century CE. It derives its name from the term "Pashu," which literally means "beast" in Sanskrit, referring to the individual soul, and "Pati," meaning "Lord," which is none other than Shiva or Maheshvara. The key teachings of this sect center around the idea that the human soul is bound by impurities and only through the grace and guidance of Shiva can the individual be liberated.

To achieve the union of the soul with God, the Pāśupata sect emphasized the importance of the intellect. It is essential to understand that the Pāśupatas believed in a multi-layered approach to spiritual growth, incorporating various elements such as intellectual understanding, ethical behavior, disciplined practice (including meditation and Yoga), and devotional surrender to Lord Shiva.

The role of the intellect in the Pāśupata path involves the development of a deep understanding and discernment of the true nature of reality. The follower seeks the comprehension of the distinction between their individual soul, the material world, and the ultimate reality represented by Shiva. This intellectual process acts as a foundation to penetrate the veils of illusion (māyā) that enshroud the human soul in ignorance and suffering.

One crucial aspect of the Pāśupata practice is the cultivation of detachment from earthly and egoistic desires. The intellect plays a pivotal role in enabling the practitioner to recognize the transitory nature of existence and the imperfections of worldly pleasure. By acquiring this knowledge, the devotee progressively distances themselves from the source of ignorance and strengthens their devotion to Lord Shiva.

In conjunction with the development of the intellect, the Pāśupata tradition prescribes a highly disciplined lifestyle, including adhering to strict ascetic practices such as meditation, yoga, and other austere spiritual exercises. These practices help purify the mind, body, and soul and create a conducive environment for the intellect to flourish and experience higher realms of consciousness.

When the intellect is constantly refined, and the individual becomes deeply absorbed in their spiritual practice, the devotee's heart and the mind become more attuned to the divine presence of Shiva. This process eventually culminates in the grace-filled experience of spiritual liberation (mokṣa), when the individual soul unites with the Supreme Soul that is God (Brahman) by dissolving their sense of separation.

In conclusion, the sentence "Salvation in Pāśupata involved the union of the soul with God through the intellect" does indeed answer the question, but the answer can be more comprehensive by explaining the importance of intellectual discernment and detachment, spiritual practice and discipline, and devotion to Shiva in the Pāśupata tradition's journey towards salvation and the union of the individual soul with the divine.
