While it is true that Washington had a vision of a great and powerful nation built on republican lines using federal power, this statement does not answer the specific question of when he was elected president. To provide a detailed and long answer, let's first address the correct answer to the given question:

George Washington was elected as the first President of the United States on February 4, 1789. Although he did not want to initially be president, he was urged to accept the role by other founding fathers due to his leadership during the Revolutionary War and his general popularity.

Now, let us explain some context to George Washington's vision of a great and powerful nation, which could serve as a supplementary response to the question:

Following the Revolutionary War, the newly formed United States struggled to build a cohesive and sustainable government. The Articles of Confederation, the first governing document enacted by the U.S., proved to be insufficient in creating a strong central governing body. Washington, along with other founding fathers such as Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, recognized the importance of having a more powerful central government in order to maintain unity among the states and protect the nation's interests at home and abroad.

This led to the framing of the United States Constitution, which aimed at creating a more efficient federal government that would have a better balance of power among the three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. Washington's vision of a great and powerful nation built on republican lines meant that he wanted a government that functioned for the benefit of its citizens, with checks and balances in place to prevent tyranny and provide equal representation.

Washington also believed in the importance of federal power, especially when it came to matters such as raising revenue for the country, providing for a national defense, and regulating interstate commerce. He faced numerous challenges throughout his presidency, where he worked diligently to enforce federal power and establish precedents that would be followed by future presidents. For example, the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 showed Washington's commitment to federal authority by suppressing the insurrection using military force, thereby demonstrating the power and authority of the federal government.

Furthermore, George Washington was also a proponent of neutrality in foreign affairs, aiming to prevent the United States from being drawn into international conflicts that could hinder its growth and development. In his farewell address, Washington emphasized this stance by advising Americans to steer clear of permanent alliances and to instead focus on nurturing its own growth and prosperity.

In conclusion, although the statement "Washington had a vision of a great and powerful nation that would be built on republican lines using federal power" accurately represents George Washington's vision for the United States, it is not a direct answer to the question of when he was elected president. The election of George Washington as the first President of the United States took place on February 4, 1789, and his vision for a strong, united, and prosperous nation laid the foundation for the country's continued growth and development over the centuries to follow.
