Countries that typically receive assistance with policing are those that can be described as weak, failed or failing, or those that are recovering from conflict or have recently undergone significant political, socio-economic, or environmental changes. These states often face considerable challenges in terms of maintaining public order, ensuring the rule of law, and safeguarding the safety and security of their citizens. In such situations, the international community, through organizations such as the United Nations, regional organizations, or individual donor countries, may step in to provide police development aid and support.

Assistance with policing is provided to countries that demonstrate the following characteristics:

1. Weak institutional capacity: These countries often have inadequate or dysfunctional law enforcement and security institutions. The police forces may lack the necessary skills, knowledge, equipment, and resources to effectively carry out their mandate, leading to poor performance and an inability to tackle crime and maintain public order.

2. High levels of crime and insecurity: Countries with high levels of crime, violence, and social unrest often require external support to strengthen their policing systems and build the institutional capacity needed to confront these challenges. Organized crime, terrorism, and other forms of transnational crime may be particularly acute in these states, further exacerbating the security situation.

3. Post-conflict or fragile states: Countries recovering from conflict or civil war typically face numerous challenges related to policing and public security. State institutions, including police forces, may have been severely weakened or even dismantled during the conflict, resulting in a lack of trained personnel and resources to maintain order and protect citizens. These states may also struggle with issues such as disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) of former combatants and rebuilding trust between the police and the local population.

4. States undergoing political or economic transition: In countries experiencing significant political or economic changes, such as transitioning from autocratic to democratic systems, the existing police and security apparatus may be ill-suited to a new political environment and require substantial reform. Development aid and technical assistance may be useful in helping these countries modernize their policing systems and adapt them to be more efficient, transparent, and accountable.

Transnational police development aid aims to address these challenges by enhancing the capacity of recipient countries' law enforcement and security institutions. This can include activities such as training programs, the provision of equipment and infrastructure, and the development of policy and regulatory frameworks.

It is essential to recognize that the transfer of policing models and practices between jurisdictions should be done with caution, as the unique socio-political and cultural contexts of each country must be taken into consideration. Donors need to be sensitive to these factors and work collaboratively with recipient countries to ensure that the assistance provided is culturally appropriate, effective, and sustainable in the long term.
