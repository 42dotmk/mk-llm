## question
Context: No mention of an office of vice president was made at the 1787 Constitutional Convention until near the end, when an 11-member committee on "Leftover Business" proposed a method of electing the president and vice president, and recommended that the vice president succeed the executive in the event of a vacancy in that position, but would otherwise serve as the president of the Senate, casting a vote only to break a tie. Although delegates approved establishing the office, with both its executive and senatorial functions, not many understood the extent of the vice president's duties. Only a few states had an analogous position. Among those that did, New York's constitution provided that, "The lieutenant-governor shall, by virtue of his office, be president of the Senate, and, upon an equal division, have a casting voice in their decisions, but not vote on any other occasion."
