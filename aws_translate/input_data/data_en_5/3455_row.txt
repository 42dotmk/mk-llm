[Question]James needs 40 fish to make one sushi roll. He goes to the market and buys 400 fish, but later finds out that 20% of the fish have gone bad and cannot be used. How many sushi rolls did James make with the remaining fish?
[Answer]If James bought 400 fish, the number of fish that were bad is 20 / 100 * 400 = 80. The remaining fish that he used to make the sushi rolls is 400 - 80 = 320. If 40 fish are required to make one sushi roll, 320 fish will make 320 / 40 = 8 sushi rolls. The answer is 8.
Q: A river is to be used for a boat race. If each boat is 3 feet across and they must have at least 2 feet between them or the riverbank, how many boats can race in a river that is 42 feet across?
A: Each boat will require 3 feet across to fit itself and 2 feet space on one side for a total of 2 + 3 = 5 feet per boat. The last boat will need an additional 2 feet space on its other side, so this 2 feet should be subtracted first from the 42 feet which leaves 42 - 2 = 40 feet. 5 feet per boat on the remaining 40 feet for a total of 40 / 5 = 8 boats. The answer is 8.
Question: In Fred the Farmer's barn, there were 100 horses, 29 sheep, and 9 chickens. Brian bought half of the animals and sold them at the market. Jeremy then gifted Fred an additional 37 goats. If exactly half of the animals in the barn are male animals, how many male animals are there in the barn?
Answer: Fred's barn started with 100 + 29 + 9 = 138 animals. Brian bought half of these, so there were 138 / 2 = 69 remaining. After Jeremy gifted Fred 37 goats, there were 69 + 37 = 106 animals in the barn. So, 106 / 2 = 53 of these animals are male. The answer is 53.
[Question]A store is selling mobile phones. This store contains 20 units of phones but the owner found out that there were 5 defective units. After he got rid of the defective units, he started to sell the rest of his units to customer A who bought 3 units, customer B who bought a certain amount of units, and customer C who bought 7 units. In the end, all non-defective units were sold. How many units were sold to Customer B?
[Answer]There were 20 - 5 = 15 units of non - defective smartphones. There were 3 + 7 = 10 units sold to customers A and C. So, 15 - 10 = 5 units were sold to customer B. The answer is 5.
Q: The swimming club went to a swim meet in another town. They took 2 cars and 3 vans. There were 5 people in each car and 3 people in each van. Each car can hold a maximum of 6 people and each van can hold a maximum of 8 people. How many more people could have ridden with the swim team?
A: The available number of people in each car is 6 * 2 cars = 12 people. The available number of people in each van is 8 * 3 vans = 24 people. The total number of people that could go with the team is 12 people + 24 people = 36 people. The team took with them 2 cars * 5 people = 10 people. The team also took 3 vans * 3 people = 9 people. The team brought 10 people + 9 people = 19 people. The team could bring an additional 36 people - 19 people = 17 people. The answer is 17.
