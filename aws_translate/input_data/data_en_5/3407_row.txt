(EW.com) -- Late last year, news broke that The Simpsons were going to turn a decades-old spec script written by Judd Apatow into an episode. As it turns out, the A-list comedy writer-director-producer is collaborating with the animated series in front of the microphone as well. EW has learned that a different episode â€” which was already known to boast Will Arnett as a guest star â€” features the voices of Apatow, frequent collaborators Leslie Mann, Paul Rudd, and Seth Rogen, plus Channing Tatum and... Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford. EW: 'The Simpsons': Daniel Radcliffe to guest Fed up with movie theaters, Homer is taught by Bart how to illegally download films, and he starts screening them in his backyard for folks in Springfield. "Even though Homer is stealing, he's doing it for the community, he's doing it out of the goodness of his heart," says executive producer Matt Selman. Alas, an overzealous FBI director in charge of anti-piracy (Arnett) doesn't quite see it that way and sets his sights on Homer.
