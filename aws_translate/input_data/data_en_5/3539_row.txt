"O Canada" officially became Canada's national anthem on July 1, 1980, when the National Anthem Act received royal assent during the tenure of the 22nd Canadian Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Pierre Elliott Trudeau. This change was made to mark the 100th anniversary of the lyrics written by Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier in 1880. However, the journey of "O Canada" to become the national anthem spans several decades and entails multiple historical events that contributed to the anthem's evolution and eventual official status.

The origins of "O Canada" can be traced back to 1880 when Calixa Lavallée composed the music for a patriotic song commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, Théodore Robitaille, to celebrate St. Jean-Baptiste Day (June 24). Concurrently, Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier, a French-Canadian poet and judge, penned the French lyrics for the song. "O Canada" was first performed publicly on June 24, 1880, at a banquet in Quebec City. However, at this time, it was not considered a national anthem but rather a patriot song for French Canadians.

The first English version of "O Canada" was created in 1901 by a Toronto doctor named Thomas Bedford Richardson. Many other English versions followed suit in the subsequent years. In 1908, Robert Stanley Weir, a prominent Canadian social figure and judge, wrote an English version of the song that proved to be more popular and eventually formed the basis for the modern English lyrics. Weir's adaptation underwent minor modifications in 1913 and again in 1927.

As time went on, "O Canada" steadily grew in popularity among Canadians. From 1927 onwards, the government began using the song for official state ceremonies, adding to its significance. Though "God Save the Queen" held the status of the official anthem for several years, "O Canada" served as an unofficial national anthem for various events and occasions.

In 1964, the Canadian government created the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism to address issues of bilingualism, biculturalism, and the perceived lack of representation of French-speaking Canadians. The commission recommended that "O Canada" be recognized as the country's national anthem.

Subsequently, in 1967, the government of Canada launched a competition called "Sing Out Canada!", inviting submissions for alternative anthems. However, no suitable alternative was deemed capable of replacing "O Canada." Instead, this event reinforced the importance and attachment of Canadians to the song, demonstrating that it had been deeply ingrained within the Canadian identity.

In the years following the competition, multiple attempts were made by members of Parliament to pass bills and enact legislation to make "O Canada" the official national anthem. These efforts eventually culminated in the successful passage of the National Anthem Act, which received royal assent on June 27, 1980, and officially adopted "O Canada" as the national anthem on July 1, 1980.

In conclusion, "O Canada" was officially recognized as Canada's national anthem on July 1, 1980, after a lengthy historical journey spanning a century, various adaptations, and a cultural investigation into the country's bilingual and bicultural nature. Over time, the anthem has become a powerful symbol of Canadian identity, unity, and patriotism.
