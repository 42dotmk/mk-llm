Q: Michael ran a bakeshop and had to fill an order for 5 peach pies, 4 apple pies and 3 blueberry pies. Each pie recipe called for 3 pounds of fruit each. At the market, produce was on sale for $1.00 per pound for both blueberries and apples. The peaches each cost $2.00 per pound. How much will Michael spend at the market buying the fruit for his pie order?
A: Each pie needs 3 pounds of fruit so for 5 Peach pies, 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of fruit. 3 pounds of fruit for 4 apple pies is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds. 3 pounds of fruit for 3 blueberry pies is 3 * 3 = 9 pounds. He needs 12 pounds of apples and 9 pounds of blueberries so 12 + 9 = 21. 21 pounds of fruit at $1.00 per pound is 21 * 1 = $21.00. 15 pounds of peaches will cost $2.00 per pound so 15 * 2 = $30. The apple and blueberries will cost $21.00 and the peaches will cost $30 so 21 + 30 = $51. The answer is 51.
Question: Fiona and Casey share the hoodies they own. Between the two of them, they own eight hoodies. Casey owns two more than Fiona. How many hoodies does Fiona own?
Answer: Let H be the number of hoodies Fiona owns. Casey owns H + 2 hoodies. Together, they own H + H + 2 = 2H + 2 = 8 hoodies. Thus, 2H = 8 - 2 = 6 hoodies. Therefore, Fiona owns H = 6 / 2 = 3 hoodies. The answer is 3.
[Question]There's a Bobbit worm hiding in the bottom of James' aquarium. Every day it eats 2 fish. After two weeks, James adds 8 more fish to the aquarium. A week later, he discovers the Bobbit worm. If the aquarium had 60 fish to start with, how many does it have when James discovers the Bobbit worm?
[Answer]First find the total number of weeks the Bobbit worm preys on the fish: 2 weeks + 1 week = 3 weeks. Then multiply that number by the number of days per week: 3 weeks * 7 days / week = 21 days. Then multiply that number by the number of fish the worm eats per day to find how many fish it eats total: 21 days * 2 fish / day = 42 fish. Then add the number of fish James adds to the starting number of fish to find the ending number of fish: 60 fish + 8 fish = 68 fish. Then subtract the number of eaten fish to find the number of surviving fish: 68 fish - 42 fish = 26 fish. The answer is 26.
Q: Mark is running for an election and wins 70% of the votes in an area with 100,000 voters. He got twice as many total votes in the remaining area. How many votes did he get in total?
A: He got 100,000 * .7 = 70,000 votes from the first area. He got 70,000 * 2 = 140,000 votes in the remaining areas. So in total he got 140,000 + 70,000 = 210,000 votes. The answer is 210000.
