she naturally looked up to her older sister. Sarah, being three years older than Erin, had already experienced many of the things Erin hadn't. This provided a sense of adventure, guidance, and a benchmark for what Erin would eventually experience as she grew older.

From a tender age, Sarah and Erin shared a bond that went beyond the typical sibling relationship. They confided in each other, spent countless hours together playing make-believe games, and exploring the vast parklands that surrounded their rural family home.

As they grew older, Sarah developed a penchant for writing, while Erin had a knack for painting. They often paired their skills, creating joint projects where Sarah would craft a story and Erin would paint the scenes that stemmed from her sister’s vivid imagination. This collaboration brought them closer and helped build a deep understanding and appreciation for each other’s talents.

Though Sarah was the older sibling, she was never condescending or dismissive of Erin's ideas. Instead, she encouraged and nurtured Erin's talents, providing a safe space for her younger sister to express herself. Erin, in turn, was grateful to have such a loving and supportive role model, and she vowed to extend the same guidance to any younger family members or friends who entered their lives.

Despite their strong bond, there were times when the age gap affected their relationship. As Sarah embarked on her teenage years, she started developing her own circle of friends and became increasingly focused on her social life. Her priorities shifted, and teenage issues consumed much of her attention, leaving little room for the bond she once maintained with Erin.

Feelings of envy and insecurity crept into Erin’s heart as she watched her older sister drift away from her. She started to feel left behind, unable to relate to the teenage dramas that preoccupied Sarah's life. But Erin also understood that it was natural for Sarah to explore new experiences and make new friends as she grew up. With a heavy heart, Erin allowed her sister the space she needed, and tried to focus on her artistic pursuits.

This season of distance was temporary. As Erin entered her teenage years, she discovered that the gap between them grew smaller. She finally began to relate to Sarah’s experiences and joined her in navigating the challenges life had presented them. They shared their trials and triumphs, supporting each other through heartbreaks and celebrating their personal achievements. It seemed as if the bond they once shared as children had been rekindled from the ashes of their adolescent turmoil.

Together, Sarah and Erin forged a unique relationship that would stand the test of time. They went from being sisters to best friends, bound together not just by blood, but by shared experiences and a love and understanding that surpassed all obstacles. Recognizing the power of their own artistic talents, they began collaborating again, aiming to make a difference in the world through their words and art.

As they matured, entering adulthood, Sarah and Erin learned the importance of maintaining their bond and supporting one another through the obstacles that life brought their way. Through hardships and successes, they cherished the bond they had nurtured and vowed to never take it for granted.
