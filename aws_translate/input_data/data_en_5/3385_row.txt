In this tutorial on how to start a campfire, several steps are demonstrated to ensure that beginners understand the techniques and safety measures to effectively and responsibly enjoy a campfire in the great outdoors. Here's what happens next in each option:

I. The tutorial shows how to light the fire by rubbing a lid on it.
In this section, an alternative method of creating a spark to initiate the fire-building process is taught. The tutorial explains that rubbing the edge of a lid, or another flat object with a rough surface, against a flint can also create a spark. The sparks are directed towards the tinder, which is a bundle of dry, highly flammable materials such as dried grass, leaves, or wood shavings. The tutorial emphasizes the importance of having the tinder arranged in a way that allows for air circulation and makes it easier for the small flames to catch onto the kindling. Once the tinder starts burning, the flames gradually spread to the kindling, which consists of small, dry twigs and branches. This is how a campfire comes to life using this approach.

II. The fire log is supposed to be a crucial part of the campfire, but your dad accidentally burned it, and he fears getting hurt by the fire.
In this scenario, the tutorial addresses potential mishaps that can happen during the fire-building process. It demonstrates how to safely extinguish the accidental fire without causing harm to yourself or others, using water, sand, or a fire blanket. After the unwanted fire is put out, the lesson continues by discussing alternative materials for building a campfire in case you run out of conventional materials such as fire logs. Resourceful participants learn that they can make an effective campfire using large branches, dry leaves, and other natural materials.

III. The tutorial shows the campfire burning on the ground.
As the campfire ignites and the flames grow, the tutorial goes over important safety tips when managing an open fire. It discusses the ideal location for a campfire, which includes choosing a flat, open area away from flammable vegetation and structures. Safe distance from tents and camping equipment is also emphasized to avoid accidents. Additionally, the video highlights the importance of having a fire ring, which is made of rocks or metal, to contain the fire within a designated space. Lastly, proper methods to extinguish the fire completely, such as pouring water on the embers and stirring the ashes, are demonstrated to ensure that the campfire area is left safe and secure.

IV. The tutorial showcases a green and red sweet recipe perfect for a campfire.
After successfully starting and maintaining the campfire, the tutorial introduces a fun and easy recipe to make sweets, such as marshmallow-based treats, using the heat from the fire. Ingredients and steps to create the dish are explained clearly, ensuring that viewers understand how to prepare the treats from start to finish. Examples could include making s'mores, caramelized apples, or roasted marshmallows. Instructions on how to safely cook the treats over the campfire are given, including using skewers or campfire-safe cookware to avoid burns. Once the treats are ready, the tutorial wraps up by showing how to enjoy these delicious snacks by the warmth of the fire with friends and family.
