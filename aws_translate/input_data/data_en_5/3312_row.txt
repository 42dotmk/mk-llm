Yes, Charles Dodgson's views and personal experiences did have an impact on his work, often in subtle and indirect ways. As an author, mathematician, logician, and Anglican deacon, his writings and ideas often reflected his beliefs, interests, and the life he led. Here are some of the ways in which his views and experiences influenced his work:

1. Literary Nonsense and Wordplay: Dodgson, also known as Lewis Carroll, was a master of literary nonsense and wordplay. His most famous works, such as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Through the Looking-Glass, and the poem The Hunting of the Snark, are rich in puns, paradoxes, and seemingly nonsensical verses. His fascination with language and logic can be seen in the way he played with words and created surreal situations in his writings, which might be partially inspired by his struggles with his stammer and finding ways to communicate effectively.

2. Religious Themes: As an Anglican deacon, Dodgson's religious beliefs did appear in some of his works. The Hunting of the Snark, for instance, contains references to the religious concept of redemption and forgiveness. Similarly, his adherence to High Church Anglican principles is also demonstrated in Sylvie and Bruno, one of his lesser-known works, which includes themes of faith, virtue, and the importance of prayer.

3. Mathematical and Logical Puzzles: Dodgson's passion for mathematics and logic is evident in his writings as well. In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the characters Alice encounters and the challenges she faces are often underpinned by mathematical concepts. For example, Alice's changes in size can be seen as a metaphor for understanding mathematical concepts such as ratio and proportion. Furthermore, the puzzles and riddles featured in his works, including "The Mad Hatter's Tea Party," encompass logical brainteasers that require readers to think critically.

4. Exploration of Identity and Personal Experience: Dodgson's personal experiences and his struggles with his stammer, as well as the question of identity, are also present in his works. In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Alice's journey can be seen as a symbolic exploration of identity and personal growth, where she tries to make sense of the nonsensical world around her. Moreover, some scholars speculate that Dodgson might have identified with the character of the Dodo, who has difficulty pronouncing his name, as a reflection of his own problems with pronunciation because of his stammer.

5. Conservative Views: While his conservative political and religious views are not always overt in his works, they nonetheless set the tone and context for some of his writings. His conservative approach to life and strict adherence to social norms informed his storytelling, which often revolved around questioning and challenging established norms and assumptions, while still rooting his stories in a traditional, Victorian sense of propriety.

In conclusion, Charles Dodgson's views, beliefs, and personal experiences indeed influenced his work in various ways, shaping not only the content but also the themes and stylistic choices within his writings. As a result, his body of work can be seen as a reflection of his multifaceted personality and the diverse range of interests he pursued throughout his life.
