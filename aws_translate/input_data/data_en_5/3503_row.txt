[Question]Jane is shopping for some fruit. She sees a stand of fruit advertising 10 apples for $2, and another one advertising 5 oranges for $1.50. Assuming there's no price discount for buying in bulk, how much would Jane spend in cents if she bought 12 of the cheaper of the two fruits?
[Answer]First, we need to find out which fruit is cheaper individually. We start by figuring out the price for a single apple by performing 200 / 10 = 20 cents per apple. Then we find out the price of an individual orange, by performing 150 / 5 = 30 cents per orange. Since 20<30, the apples are cheaper. To determine the answer, we multiply 20 * 12 = 240 cents. The answer is 240.
Q: Claudia offers art classes to kids and charges $10.00 for her one-hour class. If 20 kids attend Saturday’s class and half that many attend Sunday’s class, how much money does she make?
A: Sunday’s class is half the size of Saturday’s class with 20 kids so Sunday has 20 / 2 = 10 kids. She has 20 kids on Saturday and 10 kids on Sunday for a total of 20 + 10 = 30 kids. She charges $10.00 per kid and teaches 30 kids over the weekend so she makes 10 * 30 = $300.00. The answer is 300.
Question: James visits 20 houses to try and make a sale. He manages to sell something in every house. The next day he visits twice as many houses but only sold to 80% of houses. If he sold two things at each house in each of the two days, how many items did he sell?
Answer: The second day he visited 20 * 2 = 40 houses. So he sold things at 40 * .8 = 32 houses. So in total he sold things at 20 + 32 = 52 houses. That means he sold 52 * 2 = 104 things. The answer is 104.
[Question]A supplier is packing cartons of canned juice. Each carton has 20 cans of juice. Out of the 50 cartons that have been packed, only 40 cartons have been loaded on a truck. How many cans of juice are left to be loaded on the truck?
[Answer]There are 50 - 40 = 10 cartons of canned juice that are left to be loaded on the truck. This is equal to 10 x 20 = 200 cans of juice. The answer is 200.
Q: Carla is dividing up chores for her two kids, Anna and Billy. She wants each of them to spend the same number of minutes working. Sweeping takes 3 minutes per room, washing the dishes takes 2 minutes per dish, and doing laundry takes 9 minutes per load. If Anna does the sweeping for 10 rooms and Billy does two loads of laundry, how many dishes should Billy wash so they spend the same amount of time doing chores?
A: First find the total time Billy spends on laundry: 2 loads * 9 minutes / load = 18 minutes. Then find the total time Anna spends sweeping: 3 minutes / room * 10 rooms = 30 minutes. Then find how much longer Anna has already worked than Billy: 30 minutes - 18 minutes = 12 minutes. Then divide the difference in work time by the time to wash one dish to find the number of dishes Billy has to wash to work the same amount of time as Anna: 12 minutes / 2 minutes / dish = 6 dishes. The answer is 6.
