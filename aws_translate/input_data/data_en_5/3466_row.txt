Question: Brinley's teacher took the grade six students to the San Diego Zoo to watch and learn about animals. While at the zoo, Brinley counted 100 snakes, 80 arctic foxes, and 20 leopards. She also saw ten times more bee-eaters than leopards, half as many cheetahs as snakes, and twice as many alligators as the total number of Arctic foxes and leopards. What's the total number of animals Brinley counted at the zoo?
Answer: There were 10 * 20 = 200 more bee - eaters at the zoo. There were 1 / 2 * 100 = 50 cheetahs. The total number of foxes and leopards is 80 + 20 = 100. There were 2 * 100 = 200 alligators. The total number of animals is 200 alligators + 220 bee - eaters + 100 snakes + 80 tactic foxes + 20 leopards + 50 cheetahs = 670 animals. The answer is 670.
[Question]Chantal knits sweaters to sell. Each sweater takes 4 balls of yarn. Each ball of yarn costs $6. How much money will Chantal gain in all 28 sweaters if she sells each sweater for $35?
[Answer]The 28 sweaters need 28 x 4 = 112 balls of yarn. So, Chantal will spend 112 x $6 = $672 in all for the balls of yarn. Her total earnings for selling 28 sweaters is $35 x 28 = $980. Therefore, Chantal will gain $980 - $672 = $308. The answer is 308.
Q: Julio has four bottles of orange soda and seven bottles of grape soda in his fridge. His friend Mateo has a bottle of orange soda and 3 bottles of grape soda in his fridge. If the amount of beverage in each bottle is 2 liters, how many more liters of soda does Julio have?
A: Julio has 4 * 2 = 8 liters of orange soda. Julio also has 7 * 2 = 14 liters of grape soda. Julio therefore has a total of 8 + 14 = 22 liters of soda. The amount of orange soda that Mateo has is 1 * 2 = 2 liters of orange soda. In addition, Mateo has 3 * 2 = 6 liters of grape soda. In total, Mateo has 2 + 6 = 8 liters of soda. This means that Julio has 22 - 8 = 14 liters more of soda. The answer is 14.
Question: Nissa is calculating a jail sentence for a man who was convicted of burglary. The base sentence is 1 year of jail for every $5,000 of goods stolen. The burglar is going to have his sentence length increased by 25% because this is his third offense, plus 2 additional years for resisting arrest. How many years total is the burglar's sentence if he stole $40,000 worth of goods?
Answer: First find how many years the base sentence will be: $40,000 / 1 year / $5,000 = 8 years. Then find how long the increase for the third offense is: 8 years * 25% = 2 years. Then add the third - offense increase and the sentence for resisting arrest to the base sentence: 8 years + 2 years + 2 years = 12 years. The answer is 12.
[Question]Macy and Piper went to the batting cages. Each token gets you 15 pitches. Macy used 11 tokens and Piper used 17. Macy hit the ball 50 times. Piper hit the ball 55 times. How many pitches did Macy and Piper miss altogether?
[Answer]Macy used 11 tokens which are worth 15 pitches each, so 11 tokens x 15 pitches = 165 pitches. Piper used 17 tokens x 15 pitches = 255 pitches. Together, Macy and Piper received 165 + 255 = 420 pitches. Macy hit the ball 50 times + Piper’s 55 hits = 105 total hits. Of the 420 pitches – 105 total hits = 315 misses. The answer is 315.
