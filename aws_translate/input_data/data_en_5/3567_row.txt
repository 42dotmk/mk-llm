The borders in the Middle East were largely drawn during the early 20th century by the major imperial powers of the time – primarily Britain and France – through a series of agreements, treaties, and mandates following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the end of World War I. The process of drawing borders and carving out new states reflected competing geopolitical interests, colonial ambitions, and European disregard for the ethnic, religious, and tribal distinctions in the region.

One of the key documents in defining the Middle Eastern borders was the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement, a secret understanding between Britain and France. Designed to divide the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire, the agreement aimed at carving out spheres of influence for both Britain and France. British diplomat Mark Sykes and French diplomat François Georges-Picot proposed dividing the region into areas of direct and indirect control. Essentially, the Sykes-Picot Agreement laid the foundation for what the map of the Middle East looks like today.

However, the drawing of the borders was also influenced by the British-promised support for Arab independence, particularly in the 1915-1916 correspondence between Sir Henry McMahon, the British High Commissioner in Egypt, and Hussein bin Ali, the Sharif of Mecca. Encouraging an Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire, the British negotiated Arab independence and the establishment of a unified Arab state. However, the British later backed away from these promises due to competing commitments in the region and their alliance with France.

Moreover, the 1917 Balfour Declaration, a letter from the British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Baron Lionel Walter Rothschild, promised the establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine. This added further complexity to the border drawing process, overlapping with the conflicting territorial aspirations of Arabs and Zionists.

After World War I, the drawing of the borders continued during the Peace Conference in Paris, further solidifying British and French control over the region as "mandates" under the League of Nations. The 1920 Treaty of Sèvres dissolved the Ottoman Empire, but its stipulations for carving out a Kurdish homeland were never implemented.

The San Remo Conference in 1920 formalized the allocation of mandates to Britain and France in the Middle East. Under this arrangement, Britain was granted control over Palestine (later including Jordan), Iraq, and the Gulf States, while France received control over present-day Syria and Lebanon.

Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the borders were continuously adjusted in response to local unrest and negotiations among governing powers. However, the lasting impact of these arbitrary border drawings is still felt in the region today. The borders ignored ethnic, religious, and tribal divisions, creating a legacy of tension, conflict, and political instability in the Middle East.

In summary, the borders in the Middle East were drawn primarily by Britain and France after World War I through a series of agreements, treaties, and mandates. The process was marked by conflicting interests, colonial ambitions, and disregard for the region's complex ethnic and religious landscape, which has contributed to the ongoing instability within the region.
