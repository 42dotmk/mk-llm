Question: Jordan has a new hit song on Spotify. 3 months are left in the year, and she currently has 60,000 listens. If the number of listens per month doubles, how many listens will the song have by the end of the year?
Answer: In the first month, the song will have 60,000 * 2 = 120,000 listens. In the second month, the song will have 120000 * 2 = 240,000 listens. In the third month, the song will have 240000 * 2 = 480,000 listens. By the end of the year Jordan's song will have a total of 60,000 + 120,000 + 240,000 + 480,000 = 900,000 listens. The answer is 900000.

Q: A bus has a carrying capacity of 80 people. At the first pickup point, the number of people who entered the bus was 3/5 of its carrying capacity. If there were 50 people at the next pick-up point, how many people could not take the bus because it was full?
A: At the first pick - up point, the number of people who entered the bus was 3 / 5 of its carrying capacity, a total of 3 / 5 * 80 = 48. The available seats in the bus after the first pick up point is 80 - 48 = 32. If there were 50 people in the second pick - up station, and only 32 sits were available, the number of people who did not take the bus because it was full is 50 - 32 = 18. The answer is 18.
Question: Four days ago, Carlos bought a bag of gummy worms. Every day he ate half of the remaining gummy worms. After eating half of the remainder on the fourth day, he now has 4 gummy worms left. How many gummy worms were in the bag when Carlos bought it?
Answer: Let G be the number of gummy worms in the bag when Carlos bought it. On the first day, he ate half the gummy worms, so he had G / 2 gummy worms. On the second day, he ate half of the remaining gummy worms, so he had G / 2 / 2 = G / 4 gummy worms. On the third day, he ate another half, so he had G / 4 / 2 = G / 8 gummy worms. On the fourth day, he ate another half and had 4 left, so he had G / 8 / 2 = G / 16 = 4 gummy worms. Thus, there were G = 4 * 16 = 64 gummy worms in the bag when Carlos bought it. The answer is 64.
[Question]There are 13 3-year-olds, 20 4-year-olds, 15 5-year-olds, and 22 six-year-olds at a particular Sunday school. If the 3 and 4-year-olds are in one class and the 5 and 6-year-olds are in another class, what is the average class size?
[Answer]First find the total number of 3 - and 4 - year - olds: 13 kids + 20 kids = 33 kids. Then find the total number of 5 - and 6 - year - olds: 15 kids + 22 kids = 37 kids. Then add the two class sizes: 33 kids + 37 kids = 70 kids. Then divide the number of kids by the number of classes to find the average class size: 70 kids / 2 classes = 35 kids / class. The answer is 35.
