Question: One dandelion seed floated onto Mrs. Middleton's lawn, landed on good soil, and began to grow. After one month, the dandelion plant had grown to full size and developed a flower. At the end of the second month, the flower turned to 50 fluffy, white seeds, which blew onto the lawn. Only half of these seeds landed onto good soil, germinated, and began to grow, just as the first seed had done. If each of these new seedling plants produces the same number of seeds in the same amount of time as the original plant, what is the total number of seeds that these newest plants will produce in two months' time?
Answer: Half of the 50 seeds, or 50 / 2 = 25 seeds germinated and grew. If each of the 25 plants produces 50 seeds, then a total of 25 * 50 = 1250 seeds would be produced. The answer is 1250.
[Question]On the first day of school, Mrs. McGillicuddy had 25 students registered for the morning session of kindergarten, but 3 students were absent; and she had 24 students registered for the afternoon session, but 4 students were absent. How many students did Mrs. McGillicuddy have over the two kindergarten sessions?
[Answer]25 - 3 = 22 students. 24 - 4 = 20 students. She had 22 + 20 = 42 students. The answer is 42.
Q: Gina chooses what she and her sister will watch on Netflix three times as often as her sister does. If her sister watches a total of 24 shows on Netflix per week, and each show is 50 minutes long, how many minutes of Netflix does Gina get to choose?
A: Let g be the number of shows Gina chooses and s be the number her sister chooses. We know that g = 3s and g + s = 24. Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 3s + s = 24. Combining like terms, we get 4s = 24. Dividing both sides by 4, we get s = 6. Substituting this value back into g = 3s, we get g = 3 * 6 = 18. Then multiply the number of shows by the length of each show in minutes to find the total number of minutes Gina chooses: 18 shows * 50 minutes / show = 900 minutes. The answer is 900.
Question: Ben wants to pick 56 sugar snap peas. At his current rate of picking, all will be picked in seven minutes. How long, in minutes, would it take Ben to pick 72 sugar snap peas?

[Question]Tom hasn't been sleeping well lately. He figures he has been getting about 5 hours of sleep each weeknight and 6 hours each night on the weekend. If Tom would ideally like to get 8 hours of sleep each night on both weeknights and weekends, how many hours of sleep is Tom behind on from the last week?
[Answer]Tom ideally wants to sleep 8 hours a night for 7 days, 8 x 7 = 56 hours sleep total for the week. Tom has actually only slept 5 hours each weeknight, 5 x 5 = 25 hours of sleep. Tom has only slept 6 hours each night on the weekend, 6 x 2 = 12 hours of sleep. Total, Tom has gotten 25 + 12 hours = 37 hours sleep. The difference between how many hours Tom would like to sleep, 56, and how many hours he's actually slept, 37, is 56 - 37 = 19 hours of sleep that Tom is behind on. The answer is 19.
