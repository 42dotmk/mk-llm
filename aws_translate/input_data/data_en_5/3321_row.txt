[Question]Dorothy sells glass frames at half the price that Jemma sells them. Jemma sells the glass frames at 5 dollars each, selling twice as many frames as Dorothy does. If Jemma sold 400 frames, how much did they make together in total from the sale of the glass frames?
[Answer]If Jemma sold 400 glasses frames at $5 each, she made 400 * $5 = $2000. Jemma sold twice as many frames as Dorothy, meaning Dorothy sold 400 / 2 = 200 frames. If Dorothy sold her glasses frames at half the price that Jemma sold hers, then it means she sold her glasses frames at $5 / 2 = $2.5 per glasses frame. In total, Dorothy made $2.5 * 200 = $500 from the sale of her glasses frames. Together, they made $2000 + $500 = $2500 from the sale of the glasses frames. The answer is 2500.
Q: Nancy wanted to make peanut butter cookies for a family gathering, but her cousin is allergic to peanuts. She decided to make almond butter cookies instead. A jar of almond butter costs three times the amount that a jar of peanut butter does. It takes half a jar to make a batch of cookies. A jar of peanut butter costs $3. How many dollars more does it cost per batch to make almond butter cookies instead of peanut butter cookies?
A: A jar of almond butter costs 3 * 3 = $9. It takes half a jar to make a batch of cookies, so it costs 9 / 2 = $4.50 to use almond butter. It costs 3 / 2 = $1.50 to use peanut butter. Thus, it costs 4.50 - 1.50 = $3 more to make a batch of almond butter cookies than peanut butter cookies. The answer is 3.
Question: There were 10 snowflakes at first. It snowed an additional 4 snowflakes every 5 minutes. How many minutes passed before there were 58 snowflakes?
Answer: Without the first 10 snowflakes, there are 58 - 10 = 48 snowflakes needed. 48 / 4 = 12 5 - minute intervals are needed to get the additional snowflakes. 12 * 5 = 60 minutes passed. The answer is 60.
[Question]The school decided to have a fundraiser to collect $750 for new basketball equipment. Families could donate $25, $50, or $100. Families who donated $25 got Bronze Status. Families who donated $50 got Silver Status. Families who donated $100 got Gold Status. With one day left in the fundraiser, the school has 10 Bronze Status families, 7 Silver Status Families and 1 Gold Status family. How much do they need to raise on the final day to reach their goal?
[Answer]They collected $250 from Bronze Status families because 10 times 25 equals 250. They collected $350 from Silver Status families because 7 times 50 equals 350. They collected $100 from Gold Status families because 1 times 100 equals 100. Therefore, they collected $700 thus far because 250 plus 350 plus 100 equals 700. They need to collect $50 more because 750 minus 700 equals 50. The answer is 50.
