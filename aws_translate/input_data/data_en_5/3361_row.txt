No, the statement "Conversely, some legal documents such as the Treaty of Waitangi are internationally considered to be documents under domestic law" is not a good answer to the question "Convention, protocol, and agreement are examples of different kinds of what that can create confusion about a treaty?" because it does not specifically address the different types of instruments and the confusion they may cause.

A better answer to the question would discuss the various types of international instruments that can create confusion when trying to understand a treaty, like conventions, protocols, and agreements, explaining the differences between them and why it may result in confusion. A detailed response could be:

Convention, protocol, and agreement are examples of different types of international legal instruments that can create confusion when discussing treaties. This confusion can arise due to the varied terminology and the specific purposes each type of instrument serves. However, it is important to note that these terms often overlap in usage, as all of them are tools used to create legally binding obligations for their signatory countries.

A convention is a formal agreement between nations that usually deals with a specific subject matter. Typically, conventions are used when addressing broad issues of a general nature, establishing a legal framework and principles for cooperation between the signatory parties. An example of a convention is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which governs the rights and duties of nations in relation to the world's oceans and maritime areas.

A protocol, on the other hand, is an additional legal instrument that complements, modifies, or amends an existing treaty or convention. Protocols are used to address specific aspects of a primary agreement that may require further elaboration or regulation. For example, the Kyoto Protocol is an addition to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and it specifies targets and commitments for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by developed countries.

Agreements, which can also be referred to as treaties, compacts, or covenants, cover a wide range of subject matters and formats. They can be bilateral (between two countries) or multilateral (among several countries), and they may deal with issues as varied as trade, environmental protection, or diplomatic relations. Agreements can be either formal, like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), or more informal, like a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between countries.

The confusion surrounding the various terms can be attributed to the fact that there is no strict hierarchy or categorization for these instruments. In general, each term can be used interchangeably, although their specific meanings may vary depending on the context in which they are used. As a result, people may find it difficult to differentiate between the terms or understand the full implications of a particular document, which could potentially lead to misunderstandings or misconceptions regarding the legal obligations and responsibilities of the parties involved. Therefore, it is essential to pay attention to the context and scope of each instrument to better comprehend its purpose and effect in international law.
