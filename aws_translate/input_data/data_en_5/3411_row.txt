The missing first step in the process you have described, which covers the formation of igneous and sedimentary rocks through crystallization, is the generation of molten material (magma or lava) from Earth's mantle. This complex process can be outlined as follows:

1. Formation of Magma or Lava:
Magma is formed through the process of melting within Earth's mantle and crust. This can occur due to various factors, such as increased temperature and pressure or the addition of water and other volatiles in the mantle rocks. In some cases, the melting of existing rocks can also generate magma. Typically, the mantle's composition consists of solid silicate minerals, which begin to melt when exposed to high temperatures and pressures or when they come into contact with hotter materials from the Earth's core. As the molten material rises, it forms magma chambers in the crust.

When magma reaches the Earth's surface, it is known as lava. This can occur during a volcanic eruption, where molten rock or lava is expelled from a vent or fissured area of Earth's crust. Lava can also be extruded quietly and slowly from volcanic fissures without any explosive activity.

2. Magma Crystallizes:
As magma cools, minerals start to crystallize and form solid rock. This process is called crystallization, and the resulting rocks are classified as igneous rocks, particularly intrusive (or plutonic) rocks, as they form beneath the Earth's surface. Examples of intrusive rocks include granite and gabbro. The rate at which the magma cools and the specific minerals present determine the size and texture of the resulting rock.

3. Lava Cools on the Surface:
When lava reaches the Earth's surface and flows out of a volcanic vent or fissure, it starts to cool and solidify. This process is quicker than the crystallization of magma beneath the surface due to the exposure to ambient temperature and air. The cooling allows minerals to crystallize and form solid rock, developing into extrusive (or volcanic) igneous rocks. Examples of extrusive rocks include basalt and andesite.

4. Lava Crystallizes:
As lava cools, the minerals within it begin to crystallize and form solid rock. This process is similar to the crystallization of magma beneath the surface but occurs more rapidly. The resulting rocks are also classified as igneous rocks and are grouped as extrusive rocks since they form at or near the Earth's surface.

5. Minerals Dissolved in Water Crystallize:
In addition to igneous rocks, crystals also form through the process of precipitation from water solutions. Over time, minerals dissolved in water can reach supersaturated levels, causing them to crystallize and form solid rock. This process, known as precipitation, contributes to the formation of sedimentary rocks, such as limestone, evaporites, and chert. These rocks are composed of mineral grains deposited from a water-based solution, like lakes, oceans, or groundwater.

In summary, the missing first step in the process you have outlined is the formation of the molten material (magma or lava) from Earth's mantle through melting induced by factors like increased temperature, pressure, or the addition of water and other volatiles. This sets the stage for the series of steps that follow, leading to the crystallization of igneous and sedimentary rocks.
