A Hong Kong cop in the movie titled "Rumble in the Bronx" is the protagonist Ma Hon Keung, portrayed by Jackie Chan. The film revolves around Ma Hon Keung's adventures in New York City as he gets entangled in various conflicts while attending his uncle's wedding.

The movie plot centers around Ma Hon Keung being drawn into personal battles against the members of a biker gang led by Tony (Marc Akerstream), who have been causing trouble in the neighborhood. Keung's actions in defending the people around him make him a target for the gang, and he also crosses paths with Nancy (Françoise Yip), a lingerie model/dancer, and her younger brother Danny (Morgan Lam). Through their interactions, Keung and Nancy form a relationship, and Nancy starts to see the errors of her ways.

As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the biker gang's actions are more than just small-time criminal activities—they are actually involved with a larger, more dangerous criminal syndicate led by White Tiger (Kris Lord). The situation escalates when Angelo (Garvin Cross), a member of the syndicate, steals illegal diamonds after a deal goes sour, prompting the organization to take drastic measures in order to recover the precious stones.

In this complex web of crime, betrayal, and violence, Keung and the biker gang find themselves in an unlikely truce as they attempt to take on the powerful syndicate together. It is through their unified efforts that they may have a chance to expose White Tiger's operation and, in the process, navigate their own personal crises and transformation.
