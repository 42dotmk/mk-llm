The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is a vast and pristine region located in northeastern Alaska along the coast of the Arctic Ocean. Established in 1960 and expanded in 1980, the refuge spans over 19.64 million acres (79,559 square kilometers), making it the largest national wildlife refuge in the United States. Its primary purpose is to conserve and protect unique wildlife, wilderness, and recreational values in the area.

Within the refuge, there is a variety of ecosystems that sustain a myriad of plant and animal species. The area is divided into five distinct regions, each offering a unique habitat for various wildlife:

1. The Coastal Plain: Bordering the Arctic Ocean, the coastal plain comprises about 1.5 million acres and is the primary breeding ground for many migratory birds and caribou. This area is often referred to as the "biological heart" of the refuge because of its significance to wildlife reproduction. The porcupine caribou herd, in particular, depends on this area for calving.

2. The Brooks Range: A mountainous area in the center of the refuge, the Brooks Range provides habitat for species such as Dall sheep, grizzly bears, and wolves. These mountains cover approximately 4.2 million acres of the refuge, where rugged peaks and river valleys provide a stunning backdrop to the region.

3. The Arctic Foothills: Spread across 3.2 million acres, the Arctic Foothills are a mix of rolling hills and river valleys that provide habitats mainly for caribou, moose, and muskoxen. These lands serve as essential corridors for various wildlife migrations.

4. The Boreal Forest: Covering about 4.1 million acres, the boreal forest is comprised of white and black spruce trees, birch, willow, and alder. This region offers habitats for several mammal species such as moose, lynx, marten, and wolverine. The boreal forest is also essential for nesting bird species, like the threatened Northern Goshawk and the Olive-sided Flycatcher.

5. The Interior Marshes and Lakes: Providing an essential habitat for waterfowl and migratory birds, these wetlands cover nearly 6.7 million acres of the refuge. In the summer, numerous bird species, including the threatened Spectacled Eider, make use of this area for nesting and raising their young.

Within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, there are various environmental protections and designated Wilderness areas that safeguard these unique ecosystems and species. Most notably, over 7 million acres are designated as Wilderness under the 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, making it one of the largest protected wilderness regions in the U.S. This designation ensures that the area remains unaltered by commercial or industrial activities, allowing the natural ecosystems and wildlife populations to thrive undisturbed.

In conclusion, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a significant and valuable region for preserving unique wildlife and wilderness values on Alaska's north coast. Spanning nearly 19.64 million acres, this vast and diverse area offers a wide range of habitats for numerous plant and animal species. By enforcing environmental protections and wilderness designation, the refuge ensures the conservation and survival of the ecosystems and wildlife present within this special area.
