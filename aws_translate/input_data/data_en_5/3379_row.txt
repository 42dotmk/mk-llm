Reasoning and answer: He gets 3 * $400 = $1200 per month. So he gets 1200 * 12 = $14,400 per year. So he pays 12 * 900 = $10800 a year. That means his profit is 14400 - 10800 = $3600 per year.
The answer: 3600

After half an hour, the number of balloons that had blown up is 1 / 5 * 200 = 40. The number of balloons that haven't blown up so far is 200 - 40 = 160. In the next hour, 2 * 40 = 80 balloons blow up. The number of balloons that haven't blown up now is 160 - 80 = 80.
The answer: 80
Reverse engineering the question: A hot air balloon with 200 balloons is blowing up. After about half an hour, 1/5 of the total number of balloons in the hot air balloon have blown up. After another hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up. How many balloons in the hot air balloon remain intact?

Reasoning and answer: First, add the number of kosher meals to the number of vegan meals: 7 meals + 8 meals = 15 meals. Then subtract the three meals that are both kosher and vegan since they got counted twice: 15 meals - 3 meals = 12 meals. Finally, subtract that number from the total number of meals to find the number of meals that are neither kosher nor vegan: 30 meals - 12 meals = 18 meals.
The answer: 18
