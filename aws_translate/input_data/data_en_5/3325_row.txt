Q: The civic league was hosting a pancake breakfast fundraiser. A stack of pancakes was $4.00 and you could add bacon for $2.00. They sold 60 stacks of pancakes and 90 slices of bacon. How much did they raise?
A: The pancakes were $4.00 a stack and they sold 60 stacks for a total of 4 * 60 = $240.00. The bacon was $2.00 a slice and they sold 90 slices for a total of 2 * 90 = $180.00. They sold $240 in pancakes and $180 in bacon for a total of 240 + 180 = $420.00. The answer is 420.
Question: The difference between the price of an orange and the price of a pear equals the price of a banana. If the total cost of an orange and a pear is $120 and a pear costs $90, calculate the total price of buying 200 bananas and twice as many oranges as bananas.
Answer: If the total cost of an orange and a pear is $120, and a pear costs $90, an orange costs $120 - $90 = $30. Since the difference between the price of an orange and a pear is the price of a banana, a banana is sold at $90 - $30 = $60. To buy 200 bananas, you'll pay $60 * 200 = $12000. When you twice as many oranges as bananas, you buy 2 * 200 = 400 oranges. The total cost of buying 400 oranges is 400 * 30 = $12000. The total price of buying 200 bananas and twice as many oranges as bananas is $12000 + $12000 = $24000. The answer is 24000.

Q: There are 10 rows of 15 chairs set up for the award ceremony. The first row is reserved for the awardees while the second and third rows are for the administrators and teachers. The last two rows are then reserved for the parents and the rest of the rows are for the students. If only 4/5 of the seats reserved for the students are occupied, how many vacant seats from the students can be given to the parents?
A: There are 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 rows that are not reserved for the students. Hence, 10 - 5 = 5 rows are reserved for the students. That is equal to 5 x 15 = 75 seats. But only 75 x 4 / 5 = 60 seats are occupied by the students. Therefore, 75 - 60 = 15 seats can be given to the parents. The answer is 15.
