Yes, that is a correct, but brief answer. Jehovah's Witnesses do base their beliefs on their interpretations of the Bible and prefer to use their own translation, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. However, to provide a detailed and comprehensive understanding of their beliefs, there's more to explore.

Jehovah's Witnesses believe in a monotheistic religion with the fundamental belief in the worship of Jehovah â€” the God of the Hebrew and Christian scriptures. Here are some of the key features of their beliefs:

1. God - Jehovah's Witnesses believe that God is the creator and sovereign ruler of the universe, with Jesus Christ acting as his chief agent. They believe that God is all-knowing, all-powerful, and present everywhere.

2. Jesus Christ - They believe that Jesus Christ is God's son, the first of God's creations, and that he played a key role in the creation of the universe. They reject the concept of the Holy Trinity and believe that Jesus is not God but God's only-begotten Son. Jesus' life on earth serves as an example and model for their own lives.

3. Salvation - Jehovah's Witnesses believe that salvation is dependent upon faith in God's promises as revealed in the Bible, obedience to God's laws, and dedication to serving him. They actively engage in evangelism and outreach activities to spread the message of God's Kingdom, taking their cue from Jesus' commandment in Matthew 28:19-20.

4. God's Kingdom - One of their core beliefs is that God established a heavenly government, and Jesus Christ returned to earth invisibly in 1914 to rule over this kingdom. They believe that in the near future, God will establish a paradise on earth, and only Jehovah's Witnesses will survive the destruction of the wicked while the righteous will live forever on a renewed and perfect earth.

5. Baptism - Jehovah's Witnesses practice water baptism by complete immersion for those who wish to become members of the faith. To qualify for baptism, the person must demonstrate a deep understanding of their teachings and display a commitment to live by those teachings.

6. Moral Code - Jehovah's Witnesses observe a strict moral code, including abstinence from premarital sex, adultery, and homosexuality. They also refrain from behaviors that they consider offensive to God, such as practicing other religions, using idols, lying, stealing, or engaging in violence.

7. Observances and Holidays - Jehovah's Witnesses observe the Memorial of Jesus Christ's death (also called the Lord's Evening Meal) annually, which is the only religious observance they take part in. They abstain from celebrating holidays, such as Christmas, Easter, and birthdays, viewing these events as having pagan origins or as promoting self-centeredness.

8. Blood Transfusions - They have a strict stance on blood transfusions, believing that accepting blood from another person is a violation of God's command found in the Bible. This includes whole blood, red cells, white cells, platelets, and plasma; however, they do accept some blood fractions.

Understanding Jehovah's Witnesses beliefs can provide context for their customs, practices, and lifestyles. While the short answer you found on Google is correct, there is much more to their belief system which distinguishes them from other Christian denominations.
