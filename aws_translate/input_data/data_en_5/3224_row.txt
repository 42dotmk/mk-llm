AEG Live," Putnam said. "The evidence is overwhelming that he never would have agreed to the brief treatment urged by his family (and AEG Live), and everybody in this courtroom knows it."

Katherine Jackson's lawyer, Brian Panish, vehemently disagreed with Putnam's assertion. Panish claimed AEG Live played a significant role in Michael Jackson's death and should be held accountable. Panish reminded the jurors of the company's alleged negligence in hiring and supervising Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician responsible for administering the fatal dose of the powerful anesthetic propofol to Michael Jackson.

"You don't think someone should accept responsibility, and that's the problem," Panish said, addressing Putnam's argument. "This case is about shared responsibility, and AEG is trying to escape that."

Panish accused AEG Live of prioritizing money and profit over the well-being of Michael Jackson, putting pressure on the star which led to his eventual demise. Moreover, he argued that AEG failed to conduct a proper background check when hiring Dr. Murray, ignoring his financial troubles, and subsequently offering him a contract with a lucrative $150,000 salary. This large sum, Panish claimed, created a conflict of interest for Dr. Murray, incentivizing him to do whatever Michael Jackson asked to keep his job, including administering the lethal dose of propofol.

The wrongful-death lawsuit was filed on behalf of Michael Jackson's mother and three children after the singer's death in 2009. The plaintiffs are seeking billions of dollars in damages from AEG Live, alleging that the company's negligence in hiring and supervising Dr. Conrad Murray contributed directly to Michael Jackson's death.

The defense's closing arguments focused on shifting the responsibility of Jackson's death onto the singer himself, highlighting his addiction to prescription drugs. Putnam pointed out that Michael Jackson had a long history of drug abuse, and AEG Live had no way of knowing that Dr. Murray would act negligently and irresponsibly when the company hired him. The defense also argued that Katherine Jackson's claims that AEG Live failed to properly hire and supervise Dr. Murray were unfounded, as Michael Jackson insisted on Murray being his personal doctor, and AEG Live did not have the authority to overrule his wishes.

As the jurors began their deliberations, the entire world watched anxiously, waiting for the verdict that would determine whether AEG Live would be considered partially or fully responsible for Michael Jackson's death. The outcome of the case would have far-reaching implications on not just the Jackson family, but also on the entertainment industry, by potentially setting a precedent for holding concert promoters and producers accountable for the well-being of the artists they work with.

Regardless of the verdict, the Michael Jackson wrongful-death trial has brought attention to the darker side of the entertainment industry. It has illuminated how the pressures of fame, profit, and productivity can lead to tragic consequences, pushing those involved to their breaking points. This trial could serve as a cautionary tale for the industry, prompting a reevaluation of priorities, where artists' health and wellbeing are not sacrificed for profit and productivity.
