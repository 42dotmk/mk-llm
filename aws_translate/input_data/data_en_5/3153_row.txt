The sentence "A peace deal between warring parties was reached in 1995, leading to Taylor's election as president in 1997." does not provide a valid answer to the question "What did the Economic Community Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) do to intervene in the crisis?" The sentence only provides information on the outcome of a peace deal and its subsequent effects on a political election.

However, it is essential to explore the role of ECOMOG to understand their efforts to intervene in the crisis. ECOMOG, a multinational military force assembled by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), played a significant role in resolving various conflicts in West Africa, including the Liberian Civil War.

Here is a detailed account of ECOMOG's intervention in the crisis:

1. Deployment of troops: ECOMOG, led by Nigeria, deployed troops to Liberia in 1990 to restore peace and stability in the country, which was devastated by a civil war. The objective was to implement a ceasefire between various warring factions and facilitate the establishment of an interim government.

2. Humanitarian efforts: ECOMOG was involved in providing humanitarian and logistical assistance to Liberian citizens affected by the conflict. They ensured the delivery of relief materials, facilitated medical aid, and helped to restore essential infrastructure required to support the population.

3. Neutralizing warring factions: ECOMOG forces actively sought to neutralize the influence of various armed groups, including Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) and other factions, which were responsible for the atrocities committed during the civil war. They employed diplomatic and military strategies to minimize violence and achieve relative peace in the region.

4. Peace negotiations: ECOMOG played a significant role in mediating peace negotiations between the warring parties. They facilitated several rounds of peace talks and played a crucial role in forging agreements such as the Cotonou Accord (1993), the Abuja Agreements (1995), among others. These engagements led to the eventual peace deal in 1995, which the original sentence alluded to, and laid the foundation for the 1997 election.

5. Supervision of disarmament: ECOMOG monitored the disarmament and demobilization of armed groups, ensuring compliance with the agreed-upon conditions set forth in the peace agreements. This process was essential in preventing a resurgence of violence and fostering an environment conducive for democratic governance.

6. Election assistance: In the lead-up to the 1997 election, ECOMOG played a vital role in creating a secure environment for elections to take place. They provided security for election officials and voters, monitored the election process to ensure fairness, and facilitated the logistics necessary for a successful poll.

In conclusion, the sentence provided does not properly address the role of ECOMOG in intervening in the crisis. It is essential to highlight the military, humanitarian, and diplomatic efforts of the group in quelling violence, supporting the citizens, and helping to pave the way for a return to democracy in Liberia. ECOMOG's involvement in Liberia was instrumental in achieving the eventual peace deal and setting the stage for the 1997 election.
