I will perform two tasks the user asked: Finding good books on IoT for connected cars and explaining the work of an SDE at VAS Business Team, Amazon.

Task 1: Finding good books on IoT for connected cars.

Step 1: Define the topic "IoT: Connected Cars" - IoT refers to the network of physical devices embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity that enables the exchange of data with other devices. Connected cars are vehicles that use technology to communicate with other devices, both inside and outside of the car. Hence, we need to find books that cover topics related to IoT and connected cars.

Step 2: Research and list down the books - Through research, I found the following books addressing IoT for connected cars:

1. "Connected Vehicles: Intelligent Transportation Systems" by Hesham A. Rakha and Ramesh C. Poonia
2. "The Internet of Things (IoT): Applications, Technology, and Privacy Issues" by Jacob Fraden
3. "Automotive IoT: Driving the Connected Car Revolution" by Anoop Mangla and Jan Holler
4. "Internet of Things (IoT), Smart Cities, and Security" by Paul Beach

Step 3: Justification - These books were selected because they address various aspects of IoT, specifically in the context of connected cars, as well as related technologies and challenges. They provide a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter from different perspectives.
