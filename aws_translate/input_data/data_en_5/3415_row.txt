[Question]An organization trying to save endangered species of turtles has taken twice more hawksbill turtles than the number of green turtles into a conservation center. If the number of green turtles is 800, calculate the number of turtles that have been taken into the conservation center.
[Answer]If the number of hawksbill turtles is twice more than the number of green turtles, then there are 2 * 800 = 1600 more hawksbill turtles. The total number of hawksbill turtles is 800 + 1600 = 2400. The total number of turtles that have been taken into the conservation center is 2400 + 800 = 3200 turtles. The answer is 3200.
Q: Donna worked 2 hours every morning walking dogs in her neighborhood for $10.00 an hour. 5 days a week, after school, she worked at a card shop for 2 hours and made $12.50 an hour. On the weekends, she usually made $10.00 an hour babysitting and was guaranteed 4 hours every Saturday from her neighbor. How much money did she make over 7 days?
A: She makes $10.00 an hour for 2 hours walking dogs so she makes 10 * 2 = $20.00 every morning. Over 7 days she makes 7 * 20 = $140.00 a week. She makes $12.50 for 2 hours working at a card shop so she makes 12.5 * 2 = $25.00. She works there 5 days a week so she makes 5 * 25 = $125.00 a week. She also babysits for 4 hours making $10.00 an hour for a total of 4 * 10 = $40.00. Over 7 days, she makes 140 + 125 + 40 = $305.00. The answer is 305.
Question: Owen bred 21 turtles, and Johanna has 5 fewer turtles than Owen. After 1 month, Owen has twice as many turtles as before and Johanna loses half of her turtles and donates the rest to Owen. How many turtles did Owen have?
Answer: Johanna had 21 turtles - 5 turtles = 16 turtles. After 1 month, Owen was left with 21 turtles * 2 = 42 turtles. After 1 month, Johanna was left with 16 turtles / 2 = 8 turtles. After Johanna's donation, Owen was left with 42 turtles + 8 turtles = 50 turtles. The answer is 50.
[Question]Blake needs to prime and paint 5 rooms in his house. Each room will require a gallon of primer and a gallon of paint. Currently the primer is $30.00 a gallon and they are offering 20% off. The paint costs $25.00 a gallon and is not on sale. How much will he spend on paint and primer?
[Answer]The primer is $30.00 with 20% off so that's 30 * .20 = $6.00 off. The primer is $30.00 and the discount is for $6.00 off so the sale price is 30 - 6 = $24.00 per gallon. Blake needs 5 gallons of primer that is $24.00 a gallon so that's 5 * 24 = $120.00. He needs 5 gallons of paint that cost $25.00 a gallon so that's 5 * 25 = $125.00. The primer is $120.00 and the paint is $125.00 so all total, he will spend 120 + 125 = $245.00 on paint and primer. The answer is 245.
