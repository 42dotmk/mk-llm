In this scenario, Jordan would most likely experience a range of emotions and feelings as a result of being late to the lecture and receiving a funny look from Alex. Let's take a closer look at some of these potential emotions and consider the reasons behind them.

1. Anxiety: Arriving late to a lecture can be a nerve-wracking experience. Jordan may feel anxious due to the fear of missing essential information, the disruption their entrance may cause, and the possibility of drawing negative attention to themselves. These feelings might be exacerbated by the funny look that Alex gives, as it further emphasizes that Jordan's tardiness has been noticed and is seen as out of the ordinary.

2. Embarrassment: Feeling embarrassed is a natural response to being late, especially when the entrance is noticeable and witnessed by others. From the description, it seems Jordan's delayed arrival may have been quite conspicuous, causing them to feel a heightened sense of embarrassment. Moreover, the funny look from Alex may signify, from Jordan's perspective, that their lateness was perceived as unprofessional or unacceptable.

3. Frustration: Jordan might also feel frustrated with themselves for being late to the lecture. This emotion stems from a sense of self-disappointment, as they could be thinking that they should have been more organized, arrived earlier, or better managed their time to avoid being tardy.

4. Regret: There may be feelings of regret as well, as Jordan may be feeling remorseful about the moments of the lecture they missed. Depending on the importance of the lecture, this sense of regret could be quite strong, especially if the content covered in those twenty minutes is critical to their academic success or understanding of the subject matter.

5. Seeking validation: Jordan might feel the urge to quickly establish their competence to mitigate any potential negative impressions. They could be more eager to participate in the lecture by asking relevant questions or making insightful contributions to show that being late hasn't impacted their interest and dedication to the subject.

6. Determination: Following the initial emotional response, Jordan might feel a sense of determination to make up for being late. This determination could manifest as an increased focus on the lecture material, ensuring they take accurate and comprehensive notes and actively engage with the material to catch up on anything they missed.

7. Resilience: Lastly, Jordan's reaction may vary according to their temperament and level of resilience. Some individuals might bounce back from the experience quickly, dismissing the funny look from Alex and focusing on the lecture, while others could dwell on the incident for a more extended period, which could impact their ability to concentrate on the lecture.

In conclusion, Jordan's emotions in this situation are likely to be a complex mix of anxiety, embarrassment, frustration, regret, determination, and resilience. These feelings will influence their behaviors during and after the lecture, such as seeking validation and being determined to make up for lost time. The extent to which they experience these emotions depends on their personality traits, the importance of the lecture, and any previous experiences with similar situations.
