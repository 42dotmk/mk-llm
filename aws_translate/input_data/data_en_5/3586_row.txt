Title: Police Respond to Nervous Breakdown Claims at Tori Spelling's California Home

On Thursday morning, law enforcement responded to Tori Spelling's California home after receiving a 911 call, according to TMZ. The caller claimed that the actress appeared to be suffering from a nervous breakdown and was acting aggressively. While the alleged incident did not involve any weapons, TMZ sources described the situation as disconcerting. The sources also revealed that the previous night, Spelling had called the police herself, fearing that someone was breaking into her home. It turned out to be her husband, Dean McDermott, arriving home and no intruder was found.

The Blast obtained dispatch audio in which Tori Spelling is referred to as potentially having a "mental illness" issue. However, officers who spoke to People magazine would only confirm that the call pertained to a "disturbance" and that the situation was ongoing. While further information is yet to be revealed, it is worth mentioning that Spelling and McDermott have been struggling with financial woes over the past year, as reported by Page Six.

Tori Spelling, best known for her role in the classic 90s TV series "Beverly Hills, 90210," and Dean McDermott tied the knot in 2006 and have five children together. Unfortunately, in recent years, the couple has made more headlines for their financial struggles than their acting careers. Despite Spelling being the daughter of famed American television and film producer, Aaron Spelling, she stated in her 2013 autobiography "Spelling It Like It Is" that her parents did not leave her a substantial inheritance. This revelation spurred speculation and conversations regarding the management of her financial affairs.

In the recent past, Spelling and McDermott have faced numerous lawsuits and financial setbacks. These include a lawsuit from City National Bank in 2016, which claimed that the couple owed a large sum after taking out a loan that was not repaid in full. Additionally, the couple was sued by American Express for outstanding credit card debts in 2016. To further compound their financial woes, they were ordered by the IRS to pay back taxes for the years 2014 and 2015. The couple's monetary issues have continued to escalate over the last year, which might have contributed to the recent disturbances at their home.

The ongoing situation at Tori Spelling's California home raises concerns about her mental health and well-being. While law enforcement confirmed that they responded to a "disturbance," the details of the incident are still emerging. The stressful circumstances surrounding Spelling and McDermott's financial woes may have contributed to the alleged nervous breakdown or aggressive behavior by the actress.

In conclusion, the recent call to law enforcement and police response at Tori Spelling's residence has raised serious concerns about her mental health and the current status of her relationship with Dean McDermott. It remains to be seen whether the couple's financial struggles have exacerbated the situation, but it is clear that the situation is distressing for their family. As more details emerge, it is imperative to continue supporting and understanding the challenges faced by those in the public eye, as this can significantly impact their mental health and well-being.
