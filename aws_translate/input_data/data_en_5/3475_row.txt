Jacob can eat 12 / 2 = 6 candies before crying. Lana can eat 6 - 3 = 3 candies before crying. Nellie, Jacob, and Lana all ate until they cried, so they ate 12 + 6 + 3 = 21 candies. Thus, there are 30 - 21 = 9 candies left in the bucket. After dividing the remaining candies equally, they will each get 9 / 3 = 3 sourball candies.
The answer: 3
Reverse engineering the question: Nellie can eat 12 sourball candies before crying. Jacob can only manage half of that number of candies, and Lana can only do three fewer than Jacob. They had a bucket of 30 candies, and all of them ate until they cried. If they divide the remaining candies in the bucket equally, how many sourball candies will they each get?

Reasoning and answer: Harry ran 10 x 50 / 100 = 5 meters per hour faster on Tuesday to Wednesday. So he ran 10 + 5 = 15 meters per hour from Tuesday to Thursday. Then on Friday, he ran 15 x 60 / 100 = 9 meters per hour more. Therefore, he ran 15 + 9 = 24 meters per hour on Friday.
The answer: 24

Reasoning and answer: Anne and her brother use 1 gram + 1 gram = 2 grams. Anne's dad uses 3 grams and Anne's mom uses 2 grams so together they use 2 grams + 3 grams + 2 grams = 7 grams / wash. Each day, the family uses 7 grams / wash * 3 washes / day = 21 grams. Using that amount daily, the toothpaste will last 105 grams / 21 grams / day = 5 days.
The answer: 5
