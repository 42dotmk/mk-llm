Q: Cara has 60 marbles in a bag. 20 of them are yellow, half as many are green, and the remaining marbles are equally divided between red and blue. If Cara picks a marble at random, what are the odds it's blue (expressed as a percentage)?
A: First find the number of green marbles: 20 yellow marbles / 2 = 10 green marbles. Then find how many marbles are either red or blue: 60 marbles - 20 yellow marbles - 10 green marbles = 30 marbles. Divide this number in half to find how many marbles are blue: 30 marbles / 2 = 15 blue marbles. Finally, divide the number of blue marbles by the total number of marbles and multiply by 100 to find the percentage chance of getting a blue marble: 15 marbles / 60 marbles * 100 = 25%. The answer is 25.
Question: Two athletes decided to compete to see who had the best jumping ability. They were each going to do the long jump, triple jump, and high jump to see who had the highest average jump. The first athlete jumped 26 feet in the long jump, 30 feet in the triple jump, and 7 feet in the high jump. The second athlete jumped 24 feet in the long jump, 34 feet in the triple jump, and 8 feet in the high jump. What was the average jump of the winner?
Answer: The first athlete jumped a total of 63 feet because 26 + 30 + 7 = 63. The second athlete jumped a total of 66 feet because 24 + 34 + 8 = 66. The first athlete jumped 21 feet on average because 63 / 3 = 21. The second athlete jumped 22 feet on average because 66 / 3 = 22. The average jump of the winner was 22 feet because 22 > 21. The answer is 22.
[Question]A town has ten neighborhoods, each having four roads passing through them. Each of the roads has 250 street lights on each opposite side. Calculate the total number of street lights on all the roads of the neighborhoods in the town.
[Answer]If Each of the roads has 250 street lights on each opposite side, the total number of street lights on one road is 250 * 2 = 500. Since each neighborhood has four roads passing through it, the total number of street lights in one neighborhood is 500 * 4 = 2000 street lights. The town has ten neighborhoods, and since each neighborhood has 2000 street lights on all its roads, there are 2000 * 10 = 20000 street lights in the town. The answer is 20000.
Q: If Aang caught 7 fish, then Sokka caught 5 fish, and then Toph caught 12 fish, what is the average amount of fish that each person caught?
A: Aang, Sokka and Toph caught 7 fish + 5 fish + 12 fish = 24 fish. The average catch of fish per person is 24 fish / 3 people = 8 fish per person. The answer is 8.
Question: In a classroom, there are blue chairs, green chairs, and white chairs. There are 10 blue chairs. The green chairs are 3 times as many as the blue chairs, and there are 13 fewer white chairs than the green and blue chairs combined. How many chairs are there in a classroom?
Answer: There are 10 x 3 = 30 green chairs. The total number of blue and green chairs is 10 + 30 = 40. So, there are 40 - 13 = 27 white chairs. Therefore, there are 40 + 27 = 67 chairs in a classroom. The answer is 67.
