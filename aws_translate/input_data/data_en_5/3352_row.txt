It was easier for Robert than Aaron to tan because Robert had a job where they worked outside. Robert was employed as a landscape gardener, and his daily routine involved long hours outside, tending to lawns, planting flowers, and trimming hedges in various clients' gardens. Robert enjoyed his job, as it allowed him to stay active, maintain a connection with nature, and take pride in the beautiful spaces he helped create.

During his lunch breaks, Robert would often remove his hat and shirt, lathering on some sunscreen to protect himself from the sun's harmful rays. Despite his efforts to stay safe, he found that over time, his skin developed a deep, glowing tan that even his sunscreen couldn't prevent. In the evenings, when he returned home after a long day of labor, Robert liked to check his ever-darkening tan in the mirror, which grew darker with every passing day of the warm summer months.

Aaron, on the other hand, worked in an office as a software developer. His days were spent mostly indoors, hunched over his computer, writing lines of code, and attending virtual meetings. The only time Aaron felt the warmth of the sun on his skin was during his short walk to and from the local coffee shop for his daily caffeine fix. On a good day, Aaron might be able to squeeze in a quick half-hour outside, eating lunch in the park close to his office.

Aaron envied Robert's sun-kissed glow and often wished that his own job allowed him more time outdoors. He would try to maximize his sun exposure during weekends, spending time at the beach or hiking in nearby forests, but it just wasn't enough to match the tan that Robert easily achieved.

One afternoon, during a backyard barbecue at Aaron's house, the friends got to talking about their respective tans. Aaron complained about the unfairness of Robert's ability to develop such an impressive tan, while he himself remained stubbornly pale, despite his best efforts. "Why should you get all the good genes?" Aaron jokingly moaned.

Robert listened sympathetically to Aaron's laments but couldn't help but feel a small swell of pride at his own healthy glow. He suggested that Aaron try to find outdoor hobbies or even consider walking or biking to work to get a little extra sun exposure.

Examining their contrasting appearances, Robert stood tall with his well-toned muscles and deep tan, looking every bit the outdoor laborer that he was. Aaron, on the other hand, was slightly hunched from hours spent at his computer, his complexion still decidedly more on the pale side.

Aaron took Robert's advice to heart and started spending more time outdoors, choosing to be more active during his spare time. He made a habit of going for a walk or jog every evening to catch the setting sun, and he even joined a local sports team that practiced outdoors. It took time and dedication, but eventually, Aaron was able to build a tan of his own, although it never quite matched Robert's bronzed hue.

Despite their differing abilities to tan, Aaron and Robert remained close friends. Over the years, they enjoyed their outdoor pursuits together, each understanding and valuing the strengths and characteristics that made them unique. And while their tans faded with the seasons, the bond between them remained strong, glowing brighter with each passing summer.
