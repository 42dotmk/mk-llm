Q: Anthony keeps a bottle of vinegar in his cupboard for 2 years. Each year 20% of the vinegar evaporates. What percent of the vinegar is left after 2 years?
A: First find what percent of the vinegar is still in the bottle after each year: 100% - 20% = 80%. Then multiply the amount of vinegar left after one year by the percentage left after each year to find how much is left after 2 years: 80% * 80% = 64%. The answer is 64.
Question: In her bakery, Teal sells pumpkin pie and custard pie by the slice. The pumpkin pie is cut into 8 pieces. The custard pie is cut into 6 pieces. Pumpkin pie is $5 a slice. Custard pie is $6 a slice. If Teal sells 4 pumpkin pies and 5 custard pies, how much money does she make from her sales?
Answer: Teal sells 8 x 4 = 32 pumpkin slices. She sells 6 x 5 = 30 custard slices. Pumpkin pie slice sales make 32 x $5 = $160. Custard pie slice sales make 30 x $6 = $180. Total amount of money she makes is $160 + $180 = $340. The answer is 340.
[Question]Colston knows that his teacher loves drinking coffee and one day wants to see how much she drinks each week. He sees that she has a 20-ounce thermos and when she makes her coffee she pours a 1/2 cup of milk in, and then fills the coffee to the top. She does this twice a day. After the five-day school week, he decides to tell her, and when she hears how much coffee she drinks, she decides to drink 1/4 of what she normally drinks. How many ounces of coffee does she now drink a week?
[Answer]1 / 2 a cup = 4 ounces. Each thermos contains 16 ounces of coffee because 20 - 4 = 16. She drinks 32 ounces a day because 2 x 16 = 32. She drinks 160 ounces a week because 32 x 5 = 160. She starts drinking only 40 ounces because 160 / 4 = 40. The answer is 40.

Question: Carl has a jar full of marbles. He takes out 12 marbles to play a game with, but he accidentally drops them and 1/2 the marbles get lost. So Carl takes out 10 more marbles. While he is playing his game his mother comes home with another bag of marbles for him, which has 25 marbles in it. If Carl can't find his lost marbles, then how many marbles is he going to put in the jar after he plays his game, from both his original marbles and the new ones?
Answer: Carl starts with 12 marbles to play with but loses 1 / 2, 12 / 2 = 6 marbles Carl didn't lose. Carl takes out 10 more marbles, 6 + 10 = 16 marbles. Then Carl's mother brings him 25 new marbles to add to the 16 he has out of his jar, 25 + 16 = 41 marbles that Carl is going to put in his jar after he plays his marbles game. The answer is 41.
