[Question]Carla has 6 sunflowers and 8 dandelions. The sunflowers have 9 seeds per plant and the dandelions have 12 seeds per plant. What percentage of Carla's seeds come from the dandelions?
[Answer]First calculate the number of seeds from the sunflowers by multiplying the number of sunflowers by the number of seeds per sunflower: 6 sunflowers * 9 seeds / sunflower = 54 seeds. Next calculate the number of seeds from the dandelions by multiplying the number of dandelions by the number of seeds per dandelion: 8 dandelions * 12 seeds / dandelion = 96 seeds. Now add the number of seeds from each group of plants to find the total number of seeds: 54 seeds + 96 seeds = 150 seeds. Now divide the number of dandelion seeds by the total number of seeds and multiply the answer by 100 to find the percentage of seeds that come from the dandelions: 96 seeds / 150 seeds * 100% = 64%. The answer is 64.
Q: Once a week, it takes Kitty 5 minutes to pick up toys and straighten the living room. It takes another 20 minutes to vacuum the living room floor, seating and drapes. She spends 15 minutes cleaning the windows and 10 minutes dusting the furniture. After 4 weeks, how long has Kitty spent cleaning just the living room?
A: 5 minutes for picking up toys, 20 minutes to vacuum, 15 minutes on windows and 10 minutes on furniture is 5 + 20 + 15 + 10 = 50 minutes. After 4 weeks, she has spent 4 weeks * 50 minutes / week = 200 minutes cleaning the living room. The answer is 200.

[Question]Flies are Betty's frog's favorite food. Every day the frog eats 2 flies. Betty puts the flies she finds in a bottle. In the morning Betty catches 5 flies inside a bottle, and in the afternoon she catches 6 more, but when she removes the lid, one escapes. Betty wants to gather the whole week's food for her frog. How many more flies does she need?
[Answer]The frog eats 2 flies / day * 7 days / week = 14 flies a week. Betty catches flies in the morning and in the afternoon, for a total of 5 flies + 6 flies = 11 flies. But 1 fly escapes, leaving 11 flies - 1 fly = 10 flies. To get her frog's food for the whole week, Betty needs 14 flies - 10 flies = 4 more flies. The answer is 4.
Q: Lucas wants to get a dog but his parents think he already has too many pets and won't have enough space. He already has 12 pet beds in his room but manages to fit another 8 pet beds.

A: Lucas has a total of 12 existing pet beds + 8 new pet beds = 20 pet beds. So according to his parents, Lucas has enough room for 20 pet beds / 2 pet beds per pet = 10 pets. The answer is 10.
