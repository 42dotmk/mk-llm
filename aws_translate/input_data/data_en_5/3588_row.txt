Q: An old pirate wants to leave his treasure on an island. He has 3500 gold coins. He wants to spread this equally across 5 chests. Additionally, he will put a total of 500 silver coins and twice as many bronze coins as silver, all distributed equally across the chests. How many coins in total will be in each chest?
A: There will be 3500 gold coins / 5 chest = 700 gold coins in every chest. So, there will be 500 silver coins / 5 chests = 100 silver coins in each chest. Then, the number of bronze coins is double the number of silver coins, so there are 2 * 500 = 1000 bronze coins. So there will be 1000 bronze coins / 5 chests = 200 bronze coins in each chest. Finally, the total number of coins in every chest will be 700 gold coins + 100 silver coins + 200 bronze coins = 1000 coins. The answer is 1000.
Question: Sam went for a run in the morning. In the afternoon, he went grocery shopping and walked twice the distance through the store as he had run that morning. That evening, he went on a bike ride with his family and biked for 12 miles. In all, he went 18 miles that day. How many miles was Samâ€™s morning run?
Answer: Let X be the distance Sam ran. His walk through the store was twice the distance of his run, so his walk was 2X. He biked for 12 miles and went 18 miles in all, so he walked and ran 18 - 12 = 6 miles. Thus, his walk and run together were X + 2X = 3X = 6 miles. Thus, he ran X = 6 / 3 = 2 miles. The answer is 2.
[Question]Bryan bought 5 t-shirts and 4 pairs of pants for $1500. If a t-shirt costs $100, how much does each pair of pants cost?
[Answer]The 5 t - shirts cost $100 * 5 = $500. The 4 pairs of pants cost $1500 - $500 = $1000. Each pair of pants costs $1000 / 4 = $250. The answer is 250.
Q: Hilary is collecting her toenails in a jar to gross out her sister. She can fit 100 toenails in the jar, unless they are from her two big toes, which are twice as big as the rest. She has already filled it with 20 big toenails and 40 regular toenails. How many regular toenails can she fit into the remainder of the jar?
A: The 20 big toenails take up as much space as 40 regular toenails because 20 x 2 = 40. She has filled up 80 toenails worth because 40 + 40 = 80. She can fit 20 regular toenails in the jar because 100 - 80 = 20. The answer is 20.
Question: Betty & Paige are raising money for their kids' little league team by hosting a bake sale. Betty has baked 4 dozen chocolate chip cookies, 6 dozen oatmeal raisin cookies and 2 dozen regular brownies. Paige baked 6 dozen sugar cookies, 3 dozen blondies and 5 dozen cream cheese swirled brownies. If they sell the cookies for $1.00 apiece and the blondies/brownies at $2.00 apiece, how much money will they raise?
Answer: Together, they made 4 + 6 + 6 dozen cookies for a total of 16 dozen cookies. One dozen equals 12 cookies, so 12 * 16 = 192 cookies. Together, they made 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 dozen blondies / brownies. One dozen equals 12 brownies so 12 * 10 = 120 blondies / brownies. They sold the cookies for $1.00 each so 1(192 = $192.00 in cookies. They sold the blondies / brownies for $2.00 each so 2 * 120 = $240 in blondies / brownies. Together, they made 192 + 240 = $432.00 for the little league team. The answer is 432.
