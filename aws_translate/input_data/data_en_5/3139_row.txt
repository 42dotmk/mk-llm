Question: A car is driving through a tunnel with many turns. After a while, the car must travel through a ring that requires a total of 4 right-hand turns. After the 1st turn, it travels 5 meters. After the 2nd turn, it travels 8 meters. After the 3rd turn, it travels a little further and at the 4th turn, it immediately exits the tunnel. If the car has driven a total of 23 meters around the ring, how far did it have to travel after the 3rd turn?
Answer: From the details given, the car has traveled 5 meters at the 1st turn + 8 meters after the 2nd turn + 0 meters after the 4th turn = 13 meters around the ring. It must therefore have driven 23 total meters â€“ 13 calculated meters = 10 meters after the 3rd turn. The answer is 10.
[Question]Andy is a lawyer who's working on two lawsuits. The first lawsuit has a 30% chance of paying out $5,000,000 upon a win and $0 if he loses it. The second lawsuit has a 50% chance of paying out $1,000,000 if Andy loses and a 50% chance of paying out $2,000,000 if he wins. Expressed as a percentage, how much more likely is it that Andy loses both lawsuits compared to winning both of them?
[Answer]First find the probability that Andy will lose the first lawsuit: 100% - 30% = 70%. Then multiply that probability by the probability he loses the second lawsuit: 70% * 50% = 35%. Then multiply the probabilities of Andy winning each lawsuit to find the probability he wins them both: 30% * 50% = 15%. Then subtract the probability Andy wins both lawsuits from the probability he loses both lawsuits to find the difference: 35% - 15% = 20%. The answer is 20.
Q: Mark wants to set the record for most consecutive ropes jumped. The record is 54,000. He can jump 3 times a second. How many hours would he need to jump rope?
A: He can jump 3 * 60 = 180 times per minute. So he can jump 180 * 60 = 10,800 per hour. So it would take him 54,000 / 10,800 = 5 hours. The answer is 5.
Question: Bobby has 16 toy cars, and the number of cars he has increases by 50% every year. How many toy cars will Bobby have in three years?
Answer: In the first year, Bobby will acquire 16 * .5 = 8 new cars. After the first year, he will have a total of 16 + 8 = 24 cars. In the second year, Bobby will acquire 24 * .5 = 12 new cars. After the second year, he will have 24 + 12 = 36 cars in total. In the third year, Bobby will acquire 36 * .5 = 18 new cars. After the third year, he will have 36 + 18 = 54 cars in total. The answer is 54.
[Question]While cultivating a small farm, a farmer spent $50 on corn seeds, $35 on fertilizers and pesticides, and $15 on labor. After a successful harvest, he was able to gather 10 bags of corn. How much should he sell each bag, if he wants to make a profit of 10%?
[Answer]His total expenditure so far is $50 + $35 + $15 = $100. To make a profit of 10%, he has to make a total of $100 + ($100 * (10 / 100) = $110 from sales. To make $110 from the sales of 10 bags, each bag should cost $110 / 10 = $11. The answer is 11.
