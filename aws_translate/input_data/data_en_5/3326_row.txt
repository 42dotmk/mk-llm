Title: The Walls of Demarest

Genre: Mystery/Thriller

Setting: Demarest Maximum Security Prison

Plot:

Act 1:

James Norwood, a notorious criminal mind, is transferred to Demarest Maximum Security Prison, known for its particularly ruthless and sadistic prison warden, Arthur Demarest, whom the walls of the prison are named after. Arthur takes pleasure in asserting his dominance over the inmates and rules the institution with an iron fist. He ensures they live in a state of constant fear, which inevitably leads to high tensions within the prison.

Several key inmates, such as Mike "The Boss" Thompson, a mafia leader; Jamaal "The Dealer" Harris, a drug kingpin; and Victor "The Hitman" Martinez, a feared contract killer, among others, form a secret alliance to plot their escape. This diverse group represents each of the major gangs within Demarest and is united by the goal to overthrow Warden Demarest's tyranny.

Act 2:

As the brewing tension becomes palpable within Demarest, a new and enigmatic inmate named Ethan Walker joins the ranks. With a background in marine intelligence and elite special forces, he was wrongfully convicted of a crime he did not commit. Once inside, he quickly learns how Warden Demarest runs the prison and discreetly begins gathering information to take action against Demarest's oppressive regime. He gains the trust of the key inmates and is introduced to the alliance's master escape plan.

The plan involves a complex tunnel system, a diversion, and the use of the upcoming Demarest Prison Festival as a cover to make their escape seem like an accident. They craft blueprints, distribute tasks, and set the plan in motion. However, as the escape day approaches, someone within the alliance betrays them. Their plans are exposed, and Warden Demarest tightens security while trying to identify the mole and the instigators.

Act 3:

The night of the Demarest Prison Festival arrives, and Ethan Walker discovers the informant's identity: Victor "The Hitman" Martinez, who was offered early release in exchange for his betrayal. As the festival is in full swing, the prisoners carry out their alternate escape plan. This plan leads to a massive prison riot, and Warden Demarest realizes that he has lost control.

In the chaos, Warden Demarest is found dead in his office, causing the entire prison to fall into disarray. Suspicion initially falls on Ethan Walker, who has a military background that would make him a prime suspect in the killing. However, as the truth is unraveled by an internal investigation, it is revealed that it was Victor who killed Demarest to win favor with the alliance again and ensure the success of the escape plan.

Epilogue:

With Demarest dead and the true identity of the murderer exposed, the prison experiences a change in leadership, and new warden Mary Davies implements reforms for humane treatment within the prison.

The members of the secret alliance are apprehended following the failed escape attempt, and each faces additional penalties. Ethan Walker manages to prove his innocence and, with the help of an empathetic prison guard, successfully appeals his wrongful conviction. Upon release, Ethan becomes a highly-sought-after investigator, working to expose corruption within the prison system, ensuring no one suffers as he did.
