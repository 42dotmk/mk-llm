Question: In 21 hours, a heating plant consumes 7 liters of fuel. How much does it consume in 90 hours?
Answer: Let x be the consumption in 90 hours. We have: 21 / 7 = 90 / x because the heating plant always consumes fuel at the same rate. Multiplying both sides by 7x, we get 21x = 90 * 7. This can be simplified to 21x = 630. So, the consumption in 90 hours is x = 630 / 21 = 30 liters. The answer is 30.
[Question]Emily goes fishing and has a very busy day. She catches 4 trout, 3 catfish, and 5 bluegills. If the trout weigh 2 pounds each, the catfish weigh 1.5 pounds each, and the bluegills weigh 2.5 pounds each, how many total pounds of fish did she catch?
[Answer]She caught 8 pounds of catfish because 4 x 2 = 8. She caught 4.5 pounds of catfish because 3 x 1.5 = 4.5. She caught 7.5 pounds of bluegill because 5 x 2.5 = 12.5. She caught 20 pounds of fish because 8 + 4.5 + 12.5 = 25. The answer is 25.
Q: Rachel is an artist. She posts a speed painting video each week on her Instagram account to promote her work. To save time, she paints and records 4 videos at a time. It takes her about 1 hour to set up her painting supplies and her camera. Then she records herself painting for 1 hour per painting. She takes another 1 hour to clean up. Each video takes 1.5 hours to edit and post. How long does it take Rachel to produce a speed painting video?
A: Rachel spends 1 + 1 = 2 hours setting up and cleaning up. She paints for 1 hour x 4 paintings = 4 hours. Then she edits 1.5 hours x 4 videos = 6 hours. She spends 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 hours to make 4 videos. So Rachel spends 12 / 4 = 3 hours on each video. The answer is 3.
Question: David has a store where he sells cell phones. When he takes inventory at the end of the day, he notices that he has 10 Samsung cell phones but he started the day with 14 Samsung cell phones. Then he notices that he has 5 iPhones and in the initial inventory, but started with 8. His staff then told him that in the afternoon they realized that 2 Samsung cell phones were damaged and 1 iPhone had a manufacturing defect in the screen, so they threw these out during the day. What was the total number of cell phones that were sold today?
Answer: The actual initial inventory of Samsung cell phones was 14, but there were 2 defective phones so 14 - 2 = 12 is the initial inventory of working Samsung phones. The actual initial inventory of iPhone cell phones was 8, but there was one defective phone, so 8 - 1 = 7 is the actual initial inventory of working iPhones. Thus only 12 - 10 = 2 Samsung cell phones were sold. Thus only 7 - 5 = 2 iPhones were sold. Thus the total number of phones sold is 2 Samsung + 2 iPhone = 4 cell phones. The answer is 4.
