Question: At the Johnson family reunion, there were 45 children and one third as many adults. One third of the adults wore blue. How many adults did not wear blue?
Answer: One third as many adults as children is 45 / 3 = 15 adults. One third of adults wore blue, or 15 / 3 = 5 adults wore blue. Thus, the remaining 15 - 5 = 10 adults did not wear blue. The answer is 10.
[Question]Mickey's number is greater than Jayden's number by exactly 20. If Jayden's number is 40 less than Coraline's number, and Coraline's number is 80, calculate the total of the numbers they have.
[Answer]If Coraline has the number 80, Jayden, whose number is 40 less than that of Coraline, has 80 - 40 = 40. Together, Jayden and Coraline's numbers total 80 + 40 = 120. Mickey's number is greater than Jayden's number by exactly 20, meaning his number is 40 + 20 = 60. The total of the numbers the three have is 120 + 60 = 180. The answer is 180.
Q: Carolyn buys a silverware set with 6 knives, 12 forks, and three times as many spoons as knives. Then her friend trades her 10 knives for 6 spoons. What percentage of Carolyn's silverware is knives?
A: First find the final number of knives Carolyn has: 10 knives + 6 knives = 16 knives. Then find the initial number of spoons Carolyn has: 6 knives * 3 spoons / knife = 18 spoons. Then find the final number of spoons Carolyn has: 18 spoons - 6 spoons = 12 spoons. Then find the total final amount of silverware Carolyn has: 12 spoons + 16 knives + 12 forks = 40 pieces. Then divide the number of knives by the total number of pieces and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 16 knives / 40 pieces * 100% = 40%. The answer is 40.
Question: Mindy has 7 less than 9 times as many emails waiting for her as phone messages. If she has a total of 93 emails and phone messages combined, how many emails does she have?
Answer: Let e be the number of emails Mindy has and m be the number of phone messages? We know that e + m = 93 and e = 9m - 7. Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get 9m - 7 + m = 93. Combining like terms, we get 10m - 7 = 93. Adding 7 to both sides of the equation, we get 10m = 100. Dividing both sides by 10, we get m = 10. Substituting this value back into the equation e = 9m - 7, we get e = 9 * 10 - 7 = 90 - 7 = 83. The answer is 83.
[Question]Casey is going to stay at a motel while she works her summer job as a ski instructor. The hotel charges $280/week or $1000/month. If Casey will be staying 3 months, each with exactly 4 weeks, how much money does she save by paying monthly?
[Answer]First find the number of weeks Casey stays: 3 months * 4 weeks / month = 12 weeks. Then multiply that number by the weekly rate to find how much she would pay weekly: 12 weeks * $280 / week = $3360. Then multiply the number of months she stays by the monthly rate to find how much she pays monthly: $1000 / month * 3 months = $3000. Then subtract that number from the total amount she pays if she pays weekly to find her savings: $3360 - $3000 = $360. The answer is 360.
