Q: I'm a mod of a small discord server for fans of an internet music reviewer. All we do is talk music. 

&amp;#x200B;

One day a member joins and immediately starts calling out an inactive member (he used to edit for the music reviewer the server is based on) for being a nazi. He links tweets that are VERY borderline islamophobic. I say borderline because he doesnt encourage violence but still shows a strong despise for islam. He starts defending himself, saying he's not a nazi at all, and that he simply dislikes islam and all religions. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I don't know what to do. The newcomer literally just comes here to tell us to ban someone. And he does so aggressively, he just pukes out all of his anger onto him, which doesn't help at all. I get pissed off at both and engage a conversation with the so called nazi, to see if he actually wants to debate. But he's too busy replying to the other, so I get ignored. However the other doesn't ignore me at all, he actually calls us out for supporting nazis, but we didn't know about these tweets and I can safely say that we disagree with every tweet. The chat becomes a mess, I insult the newcomer for hunting people online. I get off the chat to think for a second. 

&amp;#x200B;

I DM the admin and we talk this through. We don't see a reason to ban the member. He's never active, and never talked about anything political, never debated or spread hate, so he didn't break any rules. I tell the admin that I want to ban the newcomer for his aggressive behavior, and because I think he's here for no reason, he would probably leave the server if we didn't ban the other person. The admin tells me to wait, since we agree on the latter part. The admin interrupts the chat and things cool down. The newcomer keeps talking in a passive aggressive way, trying to start the fight again, so I say that i'd ban him if he kept talking about that, even if I'd lose my mod role. This server is only for music, I can't stand people that ruins the chat by bringing politics. The admin yields and tell me to go for it. I ban the dude. The other one stays silent.

Later, I see a post about it in the subreddit of the music reviewer. They added that the editor in question, after working with the music reviewer, worked with an alt right symphatizer.

&amp;#x200B;

Every time I encounter someone that has extreme views (in this case, on religion), there're always people that act aggressively or insult them. I'd rather try to engage a conversation to maybe make them change their opinions, or at least to understand why they subscribe to these ideologies. You never know. I know some people that changed.

&amp;#x200B;

In this case, I didn't discuss with him since he ignored me. I also banned someone that was trying to do the right thing, at least his intention was, his behavior wasn't. We're still arguing with mods if we should ban the alt right dude. I think I acted in the heat of the moment, and I think I fucked up.
