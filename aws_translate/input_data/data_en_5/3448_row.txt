[Question]Frank needs to meet a quota at work for his sales. Itâ€™s the beginning of the month and in 30 days he needs to have 50 cars sold. The first three days he sold 5 cars each day. Then the next 4 days he sold 3 cars each day. If the month is 30 days long how many cars does he need to sell for the remaining days to meet his quota?
[Answer]On days one, two, and three he sold 5 cars each day so, 5 cars + 5 cars + 5 cars = 15 cars that he sold on those days. On days 4,5,6 and 7 he sold 3 cars each day so, 3 cars + 3 cars + 3 cars + 3 cars = 12 cars that he sold on those days. Now we combine the cars he has already sold, which is 15 cars, and 12 cars, so 15 cars + 12 cars = 27 cars are sold in total. If he needs to sell 50 cars and has already sold 27 cars then 50 cars - 27 cars = 23 cars left to sell to meet his quota. The answer is 23.
Q: James buys pistachios for $10 per can. Each can is 5 ounces. He eats 30 ounces of pistachios every 5 days. How much does he spend on pistachios per week?
A: The pistachios cost 10 / 5 = $2 per ounce. He eats 30 / 5 = 6 ounces of pistachios a day. So he spends 6 * 2 = $12 per day on pistachios. So he spends 12 * 7 = $84 per week. The answer is 84.
Question: A parking garage of a mall is four stories tall. On the first level, there are 90 parking spaces. The second level has 8 more parking spaces than on the first level, and there are 12 more available parking spaces on the third level than on the second level. The fourth level has 9 fewer parking spaces than the third level. If 100 cars are already parked, how many cars can be accommodated by the parking garage?
Answer: The second level has 90 + 8 = 98 parking spaces. The third level has 98 + 12 = 110 parking spaces. The fourth level has 110 - 9 = 101 parking spaces. So the parking garage can accommodate 90 + 98 + 110 + 101 = 399 cars. Thus, the parking garage can still accommodate 399 - 100 = 299 cars. The answer is 299.
[Question]Michael is stuck in an elevator that is slowly moving to the bottom floor. The elevator needs to move down 20 floors to reach the bottom. It takes 15 minutes for the elevator to travel down the first half of the floors. The elevator then takes 5 minutes per floor to travel down the next 5 floors. It then takes 16 minutes per floor for the elevator to finish traveling down the final 5 floors. In hours, how long did it take for the elevator to reach the bottom?
[Answer]Over 5 of the floors, it takes the elevator 5 floors * 5 minutes per floor = 25 minutes to lower. Over the final 5 floors, it takes the elevator 5 floors * 16 minutes per floor = 80 minutes to lower. So in total, the elevator takes 15 minutes in the first half + 25 minutes in the next five floors + 80 minutes in the final five floors = 120 minutes to lower to the bottom. This is the same as 120 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 2 hours. The answer is 2.
