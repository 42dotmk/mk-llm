Q: Uncle Bradley has a $1000 bill that he wants to change into smaller bills so he could give them to his nieces and nephews. He wants to change 3/10 of the money into $50 bills while the rest into $100 bills. How many pieces of bills will Uncle Bradley have in all?
A: There will be $1000 x 3 / 10 = $300 worth of money that will be changed into $50 bills. Uncle Bradley will have $300 / $50 = 6 pieces of $50 bills. He will change $1000 - $300 = $700 worth of money into $100 bills. So there will be $700 / $100 = 7 pieces of $100 bills. Thus, there will be a total of 6 + 7 = 13 pieces of $50 and $100 bills in all. The answer is 13.

Answer: Lindsey owns 4 + 5 = 9 cars. Carol owns 2 * 5 = 10 cars. Susan owns 10 - 2 = 8 cars. They all own 5 + 9 + 10 + 8 = 32 cars. The answer is 32.
[Question]Kim loves to knit sweaters and can knit as many as 10 sweaters in a day if she gets the time. On a particular week, she knit 8 sweaters on Monday, 2 more sweaters on Tuesday than on Monday, 4 fewer sweaters on both Wednesday and Thursday than on Tuesday, and half the number of sweaters she had knit on Monday on Friday. Calculate the total number of sweaters she knit that week.
[Answer]If she knit 8 sweaters on Monday and 2 more on Tuesday, she knit 8 + 2 = 10 sweaters on Tuesday. The total number of sweaters she had knit on Monday and Tuesday is 10 + 8 = 18. On Wednesday, she knit four fewer sweaters than the number she knit on Tuesday, which totals 10 - 4 = 6 sweaters. By Wednesday, she had knit 18 + 6 = 24 sweaters. On Thursday, she knit the same number of sweaters she had knit on Thursday, giving a total of 24 + 6 = 30 sweaters. On Friday, she knit half the number of sweaters she had knit on Monday, which totals 1 / 2 * 8 = 4 sweaters on Friday. So far, she has knit 30 + 4 = 34 sweaters by Friday. The answer is 34.
Q: Bethany is working at the front desk at Joe’s Gym. There were some people lifting weights when she started her shift. Then 5 more people came in and started running on the treadmill and 2 people left. There are now 19 people in the gym. How many people were lifting weights at the start of Bethany’s shift?
A: We know that 5 people came in and 2 people left after Bethany’s shift started, so there was a net change of 5 – 2 = 3 people. If there are 19 people now in the gym and that is 3 more than when Bethany’s shift started, we know there were 19 – 3 = 16 people lifting weights at the start of her shift. The answer is 16.
