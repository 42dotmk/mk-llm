Question: Mandy is ten years older than Jackson. Adele is 3/4 as old as Jackson. What's the total of their ages 10 years from now If Jackson is 20 years old now?
Answer: In ten years, Jackson will be 20 + 10 = 30 years old. If Jackson is 20 now, Mandy is 20 + 10 = 30 years old. Ten years from now, Mandy will be 30 + 10 = 40 years old. The combined age of Jackson and Mandy ten years from now is 30 + 40 = 70 years. Adele is 3 / 4 times as old as Jackson, meaning she is 3 / 4 * 20 = 15 years old. Adele's age will be 10 + 15 = 25 years old ten years from now. Altogether, Mandy, Jackson, and Adele will have a total of 25 + 70 = 95 years. The answer is 95.
[Question]A chocolate cake needs 3 eggs per cake. Cheesecake requires 8 eggs for each cheesecake. How many more eggs are needed for 9 cheesecakes than are needed for 5 chocolate cakes?

Q: Bill gets a flat-screen TV that measures 48 inches by 100 inches. His brother Bob gets a TV that measures 70 inches by 60 inches. If the TVs weigh 4 oz per square inch of screen space, how much more does the heavier TV weigh in pounds? (There are 16 ounces per pound).
A: First find the screen area of Bill's TV: 48 inches * 100 inches = 4800 square inches. Then find the screen area of Bob's TV: 70 inches * 60 inches = 4200 square inches. Then subtract the size of the smaller TV from the size of the bigger TV to find the size difference: 4800 square inches - 4200 square inches = 600 square inches. Then multiply the size difference by the weight per square inch to find the weight difference: 600 square inches * 4 oz / square inch = 2400 oz. Then divide the weight difference in ounces by the number of ounces per pound to find the weight difference in pounds: 2400 oz / 16 oz / pound = 150 pounds. The answer is 150.
Question: There are 60 ridges on a vinyl record. Jerry has 4 cases, each with 3 shelves that can hold 20 records each. If his shelves are 60% full, how many ridges are there on all his records?
Answer: First find the total number of records that can fit on all the shelves: 4 cases * 3 shelves / case * 20 records / shelf = 240 records. Then multiply that number by 60% to find the number of records actually on the shelves: 240 records * 60% = 144 records. Then multiply that number by 60 to find the number of ridges on all the records: 144 records * 60 ridges / record = 8640 ridges. The answer is 8640.
[Question]Bernie has a collection of 18 unique postcards. He decided to sell half his collection for $15 per postcard. After he has successfully sold his postcards he decided to spend all the earned money to buy new postcards for $5 each. How many postcards does Bernie have after all his transactions?
[Answer]Half of Bernie's collection means 18 * 0.5 = 9 postcards. So he was able to sell 9 postcards for 9 * 15 = $135. He decided to spend all of his money on new postcards for $5 each, so he was able to buy 135 / 5 = 27 new postcards. This means Bernie has 9 + 27 = 36 postcards after all. The answer is 36.
