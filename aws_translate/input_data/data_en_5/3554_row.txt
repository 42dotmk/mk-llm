Question: Blanch has 15 slices of pizza in the fridge. During breakfast, she eats 4 slices. At lunch, Blanch eats 2 slices, then takes two slices as a snack. Finally, she consumes 5 slices for dinner. How many slices of pizza are left?
Answer: During breakfast, Blanch has 15 - 4 = 11 slices left. At lunch, she still has 11 - 2 = 9 slices left. After the snack, there are still 9 - 2 = 7 slices left. Finally after dinner, Blanch has 7 - 5 = 2 slices left. The answer is 2.
[Question]Rodney is a door-to-door salesman trying to sell home security systems. He gets a commission of $25 for each system he sells. He is canvassing a neighborhood of four streets with eight houses each. The first street gave him half the sales that the second street did, while every house on the third street turned him away and the fourth street resulted in only one sale. His total commission was $175. How many security systems did he sell on the second street?
[Answer]Let S be the number of systems Rodney sold on the first street. He sold 2S systems on the second street. Based on his commission, he sold 175 / 25 = 7 systems. In all, he sold S + 2S + 0 + 1 = 3S + 1 = 7 systems. On the first and second streets, he sold 3S = 7 - 1 = 6 systems. Thus, on the first street he sold S = 6 / 3 = 2 systems. On the second street, Rodney sold 2 * 2 = 4 security systems. The answer is 4.
Q: A fast-food chain offers free delivery for a minimum purchase of $18. Danny ordered 2 quarter-pounder burgers for $3.20 each, 2 large fries that cost $1.90 each, and 2 milkshakes that cost $2.40 each. How much more worth of food should he order to avail of the free delivery?
A: Two quarter - pounder burgers cost $3.20 x 2 = $6.40. Two large fries cost $1.90 x 2 = $3.80. Two milkshakes cost $2.40 x 2 = $4.80. The total amount spent for the burgers, fries, and shakes is $6.40 + $3.80 + $4.80 = $15. Therefore, he should order $18 - $15 = $3 worth of additional food to take advantage of the free food delivery. The answer is 3.
Question: In a triangle with angles A, B, and C, A is 60 degrees, and B is two times as big as C. Calculate the angle of B.
Answer: Since the angles in a triangle adds up to 180, and A is 40 degrees, B and C have a total of 180 - 60 = 120 degrees. Since B is two times bigger than C, the total of the angles of B and C is equal to 2C + C = 120. 3C = 120. The angle of C is C = 120 / 3. C is 40. Since B is two times as big as C, B is 2 * 40 = 80 degrees. The answer is 80.
