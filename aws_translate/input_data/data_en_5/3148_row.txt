The story of Joseph is found in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) within the book of Genesis, specifically from chapters 37 to 50. The narrative provides a detailed account of Joseph's life, beginning with his birth and early years, his sale into slavery, his rise to prominence in Egypt, and culminating in his reconciliation with his family.

Joseph is introduced in Genesis 37 as the favored son of Jacob, born to his father's beloved wife, Rachel. He was gifted with a special ability to interpret dreams, which led to his father bestowing upon him a "coat of many colors." Joseph's brothers, however, were envious of Joseph's special status and their father's favoritism. This envy amplified when Joseph shared two dreams he had, in which his brothers would eventually bow down to him.

Out of jealousy, Joseph's brothers sold him into slavery to a group of Midianite merchants, who then took him to Egypt. After being sold, Joseph became a servant to a high-ranking Egyptian officer named Potipar. Joseph proved himself to be a trusted and capable servant, gaining Potipar's favor as he was placed in charge of the entire household. Unfortunately, Joseph faced a major obstacle when Potipar's wife falsely accused him of sexual misconduct. As a result, he was thrown into prison.

While in prison, Joseph continued to demonstrate his gift for dream interpretation by correctly interpreting the dreams of two fellow prisoners: a cupbearer and a baker. Both dreams served as prophetic, accurately predicting the prisoners' futures. Later, when the Pharaoh of Egypt experienced two troubling dreams that no one could interpret, the cupbearer (who had been released from prison) remembered Joseph's ability and recommended him to the Pharaoh.

Joseph interpreted the Pharaoh's dreams, which revealed that Egypt would face seven years of abundant harvest followed by seven years of severe famine. Impressed by Joseph's wisdom, the Pharaoh appointed him as the highest ranking official in the Egyptian government and his personal advisor. Joseph's role was to manage the collection, storage, and distribution of grain throughout Egypt during the years of abundance to prepare for the coming famine.

When the famine arrived, it affected not only Egypt, but also the surrounding regions, including the land of Canaan where Joseph's family lived. Joseph's brothers traveled to Egypt in search of food without realizing that their brother was now the overseer of the country's grain supply. Through a series of encounters, Joseph tested his brothers' loyalty, eventually revealing his true identity to them.

Their reunion was emotional, with Joseph forgiving his brothers for their past mistakes and inviting them to bring the entire family to live in Egypt under his care and protection. This resulted in the migration of Joseph's father, Jacob, and the entire family to Egypt, where they were reunited and settled in the land of Goshen.

Joseph's story concludes in Genesis 50, when he dies at the age of 110, after witnessing the birth of his great-grandchildren. Joseph's journey from his early life as a favored son to being sold into slavery, rising to power in Egypt, and eventually reconciling with his family symbolizes themes of forgiveness, humility, and God's redemptive plan throughout the Bible.
