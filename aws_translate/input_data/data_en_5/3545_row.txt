[Question]A local college is offering German lessons and currently has 8 students enrolled. Through advertising, 8 more became interested but a fourth of these dropped out within a day. 2 more got frustrated and left. The class then rallied to show how simple the course actually is and increased enrollment by 5 times the amount of students already enrolled in the class, but 2 had to drop it because of scheduling conflicts. After one last rally, 6 more people enrolled. As the days passed, half of the class eventually dropped, and half of the remaining students graduated. How many are still enrolled?
[Answer]8 + 8 = 16 students are enrolled in the German class. 8 * .25 = 2 dropped out from the new recruits. 2 more left, so the class had 16 - 2 - 2 = 12 students left. There were 12 * 5 + 12 = 72 total students in the class after the rally. Two people had to drop the class, so there were 72 - 2 = 70 left. 70 + 6 = 76 were enrolled after the final rally. 76 / 2 = 38 are left after half the class dropped. 38 / 2 = 19 are left after half the class graduated. The answer is 19.
Q: The total number of lions in a park is twice the number of leopards in the same park. The number of elephants is half the combined number of lions and leopards. Calculate the total population of the three animals in the park if the number of lions is 200.
A: If there are 200 lions in the park, which is twice the number of leopards in the park, there are 200 / 2 = 100 leopards in the park. The total population of lions and leopards in the park is 200 lions + 100 leopards = 300. The number of elephants in the park is 1 / 2 the total population of lions and leopards; thus, there are 300 / 2 = 150 elephants in the park. There are a total of 150 + 300 = 450 animals in the park. The answer is 450.
Question: Mrs. Young buys a 300 piece puzzle set for her three sons. She divides the pieces evenly to the three boys. Reyn can place 25 pieces into the puzzle picture. Rhys places twice as much as Reyn. Rory places three times as much as Reyn. Altogether, how many puzzle pieces are still left to be placed?
Answer: Each son receives 300 / 3 = 100 pieces. Rhys places 25 x 2 = 50 pieces. Rory places 25 x 3 = 75 pieces. All three boys place 25 + 50 + 75 = 150 pieces. The boys have not placed 300 - 150 = 150 pieces. The answer is 150.
