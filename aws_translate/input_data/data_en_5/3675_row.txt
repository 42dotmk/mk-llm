The assertion that the War on Drugs has failed and that there needs to be a new dialogue to decide on the course forward is backed by a significant amount of evidence. Several aspects of this evidence will be covered in this response, such as increased drug usage and addiction, the escalating cost of drug interdiction and incarceration, violations of human rights, perpetuation of drug-related violence and organized crime, and the negative public health effects.

1. Increased drug usage and addiction: The War on Drugs was launched to curtail drug use and addiction. However, statistics show that drug use has not decreased but increased globally. For instance, the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime estimated that in 2017, over 271 million people worldwide had used drugs, representing an increase of 30% since 2009. Similarly, drug addiction cases have not decreased but rather escalated, affecting millions of families and communities.

2. Escalating cost of drug interdiction and incarceration: The War on Drugs has led to significant financial investments in law enforcement, border control, and the criminal justice system. In the United States alone, it is estimated that over $1 trillion has been spent on the War on Drugs since its inception. This expenditure has not resulted in meaningful reductions in drug distribution or consumption, highlighting the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the current approach.

3. Violations of human rights: A crucial side effect of the War on Drugs has been the systematic violation of human rights. There have been numerous instances of extrajudicial killings, torture, and other abuses by law enforcement and military personnel in the pursuit of drug criminals. In countries like the Philippines, thousands of people have been killed in drug-related operations, often without due process or accountability.

4. Perpetuation of drug-related violence and organized crime: The War on Drugs has inadvertently led to the strengthening of drug cartels and other criminal organizations. As authorities crack down on drug production and distribution, cartels resort to more violent means to protect their business and territory. This results in increased violence, often with innocent civilians caught in the crossfire. For example, in Mexico, the drug war has led to tens of thousands of deaths and forced disappearances over the past decade.

5. Negative public health effects: The criminalization of drug use has driven people to consume drugs in unsafe environments and to use potentially contaminated substances. Furthermore, the stigma attached to drug use has deterred individuals from seeking help for drug addiction or from accessing harm reduction services, such as needle exchange programs. This has led to a rise in drug overdose deaths, the spread of infectious diseases like HIV and hepatitis C, and other negative health outcomes.

These pieces of evidence call into question the effectiveness of the War on Drugs and show that a new dialogue is necessary to decide on a more efficient and humane course forward that focuses on harm reduction, prevention, and evidence-based drug policies. Potential alternatives include drug decriminalization, legalization and regulation of certain substances, increased funding for treatment programs, and adopting public health-centered policies.
