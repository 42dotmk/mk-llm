In order to conclude that "Most people cry in this situation," we must first define the context of the situation and gather substantial evidence to support the claim. The phrase "if and be ready to cry or whatever" provides an indication that the situation involves emotional response but lacks specific details about the exact context. 

To make an accurate conclusion, we need to consider various factors, such as the nature of the situation, emotions involved, individual differences, and cultural factors, as emotional responses can vary from person to person and across different cultures.

1. Nature of the situation: Investigate the circumstances that would typically evoke crying or a similar emotional response, such as sadness, loss, frustration, or pain. Examples of situations that may evoke crying include attending a funeral, receiving devastating news, or experiencing rejection. Establishing the type of situation will help narrow down potential reasons for the emotional response and enable us to focus on commonalities among individuals.

2. Emotions involved: Identify the specific emotions that are typically felt in the situation and to what degree. Crying may not always be associated with negative emotions; people also cry from joy, relief, or gratitude. Analyzing the range of emotions involved would help provide a more robust conclusion about whether most people cry in the given situation.

3. Individual differences: Recognize that not all individuals respond to situations in the same manner or exhibit emotions in the same way. Some people may be more prone to cry, while others may express their emotions through alternative means, such as anger, laughter, silence, or withdrawal. Personal factors, such as life experiences, mental health, emotional intelligence, and coping mechanisms, play a significant role in an individual's response to a situation.

4. Cultural factors: Acknowledge the influence of cultural norms and practices in shaping emotional responses. Some cultures may encourage crying and emotional expression, while others may promote suppressing emotions, especially in public settings. Being aware of these cultural differences will be important for providing a more holistic perspective.

After considering these factors, gather evidence in the form of studies, surveys, or observations that quantify the proportion of people who cry in the specified situation. Credible data can help strengthen the conclusion and provide insight into whether crying is indeed the most common emotional response in the defined context. A consistently high percentage of individuals who cry across multiple studies or surveys, taking into account the above factors, would support the conclusion that "Most people cry in this situation."

Overall, an informed conclusion should reflect a comprehensive understanding of the situation, emotions involved, individual differences, and cultural factors, backed by credible data. If it is determined that a majority of individuals do cry in the given situation, it would then be accurate to conclude that "Most people cry in this situation." However, without sufficient context and evidence, the statement remains too vague, and drawing a conclusion based solely on the phrase "if and be ready to cry or whatever" would be inconclusive and unreliable.
