Based on the given premise, it is difficult to make a direct determination whether the hypothesis, "there is a lot of money being invested in improving the quality of life in later years," is true or not. The premise states that medical science has prolonged life but not necessarily the quality of life, implying that there are limitations to the advancements made in medical science. To address the hypothesis accurately, we need to examine the ongoing research, allocations of funds, and investor perspectives in the field of medical science and health technology aimed at improving the quality of life in later years.

There is evidence suggesting that significant amounts of funding and investment are being directed towards improving the quality of life for aging individuals. Governments, research institutions, and private investors have increasingly recognized the need to direct resources towards research and development in healthcare and medical technologies. The objective of such investment is to enhance the quality of life for individuals as they age, thereby curbing the undesirable implications of diseases and ailments associated with aging.

Some examples of areas that attract substantial investment include:

1. Geriatric care and research: Geriatrics is a medical specialty focused on the health and well-being of older adults. With an aging global population, there is increasing recognition of the need for investment in geriatric care, ranging from pharmaceutical development for age-related diseases to research in the prevention and management of common ailments in the elderly.

2. Regenerative medicine: This field explores the potential of regenerating damaged or degenerating tissues and organs, which could lead to significant improvements in the quality of life for individuals suffering from chronic illnesses, disabilities, or age-related conditions.

3. Biotechnology and genetic research: The investigation of genetic factors contributing to the aging process, as well as the development of targeted therapies, can lead to personalized and effective treatments for age-related diseases, thereby improving the quality of later life.

4. Assistive technologies: The development and commercialization of devices and technologies that can assist older adults in performing daily tasks can have a substantial impact on maintaining their independence and quality of life.

5. Funding for aging research institutions: Many governments and private institutions have increased their support for aging research centers and agencies. These investments aim to develop a better understanding of the aging process and translate that knowledge into improved healthcare and quality of life for the elderly.

While it is true that advancements in medical science have achieved life extension without necessarily prolonging the quality of life, the hypothesis that a considerable amount of money is being directed towards enhancing the quality of life in later years cannot be dismissed. With the continuous growth of the global aging population and the increasing demand for effective solutions to manage age-related diseases and conditions, it can be posited that substantial funding is being allocated to bridge the gap between life extension and the preservation of a high quality of life for older adults.
