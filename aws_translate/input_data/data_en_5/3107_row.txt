No, the statement "In 1807, Thomas Young was possibly the first to use the term 'energy' instead of vis viva, in its modern sense" does not correctly answer the question of when the law of conservation of energy was first postulated. The statement only addresses the introduction of the term "energy" in its modern sense by Thomas Young. The law of conservation of energy, also known as the first law of thermodynamics, states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.

To fully address this question, we need to discuss the various figures, concepts, and historical events that led to the development and understanding of the law of conservation of energy. The evolution of this law can be traced back to the works of several scientists and thinkers through history.

1. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716): Leibniz was a German mathematician and philosopher who introduced the concept of vis viva, or living force, arguing that the true measure of the mechanical force of a system is the product of its mass and the square of its velocity (mv^2). This concept laid the groundwork for the understanding of kinetic energy.

2. Émilie du Châtelet (1706-1749): A French mathematician and physicist, du Châtelet recognized that the concept of vis viva also applied to the conservation of energy in a mechanical system. She translated Newton's Principia Mathematica and expanded on Leibniz's work, further establishing the connection between vis viva and energy conservation.

3. Julius Robert von Mayer (1814-1878): A German physician and physicist, Mayer proposed the idea that heat and mechanical work are interconvertible forms of energy. In 1842, he published a paper stating that "Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, but merely changed from one form to another." This statement can be considered the first clear articulation of the law of conservation of energy.

4. James Prescott Joule (1818-1889) and Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894): Joule, a British physicist, and Helmholtz, a German physicist, conducted independent experiments and developed mathematical descriptions of the energy conservation principle. Joule demonstrated the mechanical equivalent of heat through his famous "Joule's apparatus" experiment, while Helmholtz's work focused on the broader concept of energy conservation in various physical systems.

5. William Thomson (1824-1907), later known as Lord Kelvin: A British physicist who helped unify the different concepts of energy conservation into a coherent theory. Thomson contributed significantly to establishing thermodynamics and its laws, including his formulation of the second law of thermodynamics.

Considering these historical milestones and contributions, the law of conservation of energy was developed and refined over several centuries through the work of many individuals. It does not have a specific date of postulation but evolved through continuous research and progress in the scientific community. However, if one needs to credit a specific scientist for stating the principle, Julius Robert von Mayer's work in 1842 stating that "Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, but merely changed from one form to another" could be considered the first clear articulation of the law of conservation of energy.
