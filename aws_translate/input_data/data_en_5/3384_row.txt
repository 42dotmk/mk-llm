Title: Newton D. Baker and the Selective Service: The Blindfolded Draw and its Lasting Impact on U.S. Military Service

Introduction

The Selective Service Act of 1917 was a game-changing moment in the history of the United States' military service. While the draft had been utilized in the past, primarily during the Civil War, this was the first time that a nationwide, systematic approach would be taken to conscript young men into military service. This article aims to explore the exact timeline of events that transpired around this defining act of legislation, particularly delving into the moment when Newton D. Baker, then-Secretary of War, selected numbers blindfolded to determine which young men would be chosen to serve.

Selective Service Act of 1917 and Nationwide Registration

The United States declared war on Germany on April 6, 1917, which necessitated a rapid increase in the size of the U.S. Armed Forces. To meet this need, the Selective Service Act was passed and signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson on May 18, 1917. This law required all young men between the ages of 21 and 30 to register for the draft. The age limit was later increased to include those between 18 and 45 years old.

Nationwide registration for the draft took place on June 5, 1917. This was a significant event as it established a system in which young men could be called upon to serve their country in times of conflict. Within a few weeks, millions of young men across the country had registered for potential military service.

Newton D. Baker's Blindfolded Draw

Just over a month after the registration, the pivotal moment arrived when the order of the draftees needed to be determined. This was done in a rather unorthodox manner. On July 20, 1917, Secretary of War Newton D. Baker famously drew numbers while blindfolded at the War Department in Washington, D.C. The purpose of this act was to ensure a fair and random selection of the young men who would be called to serve.

In total, approximately 10,000 numbers were drawn to determine the order of induction for the young men who had registered for the draft. This historic event was attended by government officials and members of the press, marking a momentous occasion in the nation's history that signified both its commitment to and the sacrifice required for the war effort.

Conclusion

Answering the question as to how many days elapsed between nationwide registration and Newton D. Baker's blindfolded draw, we can calculate the exact period. Registration occurred on June 5, 1917, and the blindfolded draw took place on July 20, 1917. By counting the days between these dates, we arrive at a total of 45 days.

The Selective Service and subsequent draft marked a crucial turning point in the United States' participation in World War I. This process demonstrated not only the nation's dedication to the war effort but also the willingness of its citizens to step up and serve when called upon. Newton D. Baker's blindfolded draw further exhibited a commitment to impartiality and fairness in determining which young men would be conscripted into military service. Although the draft was met with mixed reactions at the time, it undoubtedly shaped the eventual outcome of the war and laid the foundation for future mobilizations of the U.S. military.
