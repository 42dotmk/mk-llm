The most logical next event after getting to know your team members is to establish team roles, set clear objectives and goals, create an environment of trust and cooperation, develop a solid communication strategy, and consistently monitor and evaluate the team's progress. 

1. Establishing team roles:
Once you have a thorough understanding of the abilities, background, and experience of each team member, you can better assign roles that fit each individual's strengths. This will help in maximizing their potential and contributing significantly to the team's overall success.

2. Setting clear objectives and goals:
With the team roles in place, the next logical step is to set clear objectives and goals. Clearly define the purpose of the team, the specific tasks, and how success will be measured. Make sure all team members have a good understanding of what they are working towards so that everyone can work in unison and contribute effectively.

3. Create an environment of trust and cooperation:
The success of a team largely relies on trust and cooperation among its members. To build trust, it is essential to encourage open communication and transparency, show appreciation and recognition for individual contributions, and actively address any conflicts that may arise. This will help foster a sense of unity and collaboration within the team.

4. Develop a solid communication strategy:
Establishing effective communication is vital for a team's success. Develop a communication plan that clarifies how team members will communicate with each other and share information. This could include holding regular meetings, using project management tools, or setting up internal chat channels. Make sure that all team members are aware of and comfortable with the channels of communication to prevent misunderstandings and ensure smooth operations.

5. Consistently monitor and evaluate team progress:
Regularly assessing the team's performance is crucial in maintaining productivity and ensuring continuous improvement. Set up consistent progress check-ins and revisit objectives and goals regularly to ensure that the team is on track. If there are any obstacles or issues, address them promptly and take necessary action to resolve them.

6. Provide support and professional development opportunities:
A successful team is one that grows and evolves over time. Investing in the professional development of team members will not only improve their skills but also increase their motivation and loyalty to the team. Offer support, guidance, and training opportunities that will encourage their personal and professional growth.

7. Celebrate achievements and milestones:
Recognizing the hard work and achievements of your team is essential in fostering a positive working environment and encouraging continued success. Celebrate milestones and accomplishments, both big and small, and show appreciation for individual contributions.

In summary, building a successful team involves a myriad of factors, including establishing clear roles and goals, fostering trust and cooperation, ensuring effective communication, and continuously monitoring and evaluating team progress. By following these steps, you can create a strong, cohesive, and successful team that will accomplish great things together.
