## question
When a meteoroid, comet, or asteroid enters Earth's atmosphere at a speed typically in excess of 20 km / s (72,000 km / h; 45,000 mph), aerodynamic heating of that object produces a streak of light, both from the glowing object and the trail of glowing particles that it leaves in its wake. This phenomenon is called a meteor or "shooting star". A series of many meteors appearing seconds or minutes apart and appearing to originate from the same fixed point in the sky is called a meteor shower. If that object withstands ablation from its passage through the atmosphere as a meteor and impacts with the ground, it is then called a meteorite.

Based on this passage, what do you call a meteor that has fallen to earth?
