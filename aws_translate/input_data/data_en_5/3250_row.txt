They find an isolated cabin in the woods, advertised as the perfect getaway spot and decide to rent it. Little do they know, the cabin's history is a dark one, and once inside, they find a mysterious book, the Naturom Demonto.

The first half of the movie revolves around the group's initial curiosity about the book and the cabin. As they explore both, they realize that the book is written in an ancient language, and it contains sinister images and incantations. Several warnings are scribbled across the pages, which renders them hesitant to read it out loud. However, Kevin's curiosity gets the better of him, and he whispers one of the incantations, accidentally unleashing a powerful, dark force within the cabin.

Following the incident, they start experiencing terrifying events. It starts small, like strange noises and shadows. However, soon it escalates to the members of the group finding themselves targets of the sinister forces present. It becomes evident that the spirits, awakened by Kevin, have possessed the cabin and its surroundings, leading to an intense game of cat and mouse. 

The friends now search desperately for assistance to remove the curse. Their frantic research leads them to a mysterious local named Evelyn who seems to know everything about the cabin and the curse of Naturom Demonto. She has a history with the cursed book and reveals that her ancestors were the ones who crafted the Naturom Demonto centuries ago. They intended to use it as a weapon against their enemies, but they lost control of its power, causing the death of many innocent people.

Evelyn explains that the only way to break the curse is by destroying the book. But this task is easier said than done, as the curse has spread through the woods, and the group confronts various supernatural hazards - some of which result in casualties amongst the friends. Jack, after a grim battle, eventually succeeds in destroying the book by hurling it into a bonfire. The friends mourn their losses, but it is here that the twist is revealed. 

Evelyn, who had been presenting herself as an ally, is revealed to be the last surviving member of the coven responsible for creating the book. She had been feeding off the dark energy inside the book, waiting for the perfect time to harness its power. In a climactic showdown, the remaining friends have to tap into their inner strength to defeat Evelyn, who is hell-bent on unleashing evil upon the world.

Ultimately, they manage to defeat her, utilizing the knowledge they learned about the curse during their ordeal. The story ends with the surviving members of the group burning down the cursed cabin and putting everything behind them, only to receive a chilling text message, suggesting that another cursed artifact awaits them, setting the stage for a possible sequel.
