Tanya didn't get accepted by the college of her choice while Christine did, since Tanya had a low SAT score. The two friends had been dreaming of attending the same prestigious college since they were young, envisioning themselves as roommates and conquering their academic and personal lives together. They often spent their weekends studying, attending preparatory classes and participating in extracurricular activities to strengthen their application profiles.

In their senior year, both young women eagerly awaited their acceptance letters from the college of their dreams. As the day of announcement approached, their anxiety levels were on the rise. Tanya had always been worried about her SAT scores; she had taken the test twice, hoping for an impressive result. However, her anxiety and lack of confidence had affected her performance, leading her to score below the acceptable range for the college of her choice.

On the other hand, Christine had managed to secure a remarkable SAT score, meeting and surpassing the university's requirements. This, combined with her excellent GPA, strong recommendation letters, and outstanding participation in extracurricular activities, made her the ideal candidate.

When the day finally arrived, Tanya and Christine received their respective decision letters. Christine's eyes sparkled with joy as she read the words "congratulations" and "accepted" on her letter. Tanya, however, could feel her heart sink as she came across the words "regrettably" and "unfortunately" in her letter.

The college had stated that Tanya's low SAT score was the main reason behind their decision. It was a turning point in her life. As the initial shock and disappointment began to fade, Tanya resolved to use this setback as a catalyst for growth and self-improvement. She refused to let her SAT score dictate her future; she was determined not to let this singular aspect define her worth.

While it was heartwarming to see her best friend succeed, Tanya couldn't help but feel a pang of envy and sadness. The prospect of parting ways and embarking on different journeys was not easy for either of them. Christine, understanding the situation, tried her best to support Tanya emotionally, reminding her that she had other exceptional qualities and ought to be proud of her accomplishments too.

Tanya soon gained perspective on her situation and, after some deep introspection and serious consideration, decided to enroll in a local community college to bolster her academic credentials. She was determined to improve her academic performance and prepare for the possibility of transferring to the college of her choice in the future.

As both friends began their respective college journeys, they remained close and supportive of each other. Christine embarked on her academic pursuits at the prestigious college, while Tanya worked diligently at her community college, making the most of the academic opportunities presented to her.

In the end, Tanya's low SAT score had only been a temporary setback, and it had taught her important lessons about resilience and self-worth. Through hard work, determination, and support from her friend Christine, Tanya eventually found her way to achieve her goals, showcasing that sometimes the path to success is forged through overcoming obstacles.
