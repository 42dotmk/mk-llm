Consequently, the budget for Section 18 regarding the Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice has increased to 105 million euros, which will contribute to strengthening the administrative and financial management of the member states.

In more detail, this increase in the budget for Section 18 - the Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice - highlights the growing importance of creating an environment where European citizens can effectively exercise their rights and freedoms. The budget increase will have a direct impact on various aspects of the European Union's functioning, including improved security measures, more efficient legal proceedings, and better management of migration and asylum policies. 

The 105 million euros allocated to this section will be distributed among several key initiatives designed to enhance the cooperation and coordination among European member states. These initiatives include the following:

1. Strengthening border security: A significant portion of the budget increase will be dedicated to improving border control measures, with a particular focus on member states that are more exposed to external border pressures. This step is crucial in ensuring the containment of irregular migration and preserving the safety and security of European citizens.

2. Enhancing police and judicial cooperation: Enhanced cooperation between law enforcement agencies and judicial authorities is essential in the fight against terrorism, organized crime, and cross-border criminal activities. The additional funds will enable the implementation of advanced IT systems and tools, as well as the organization of joint training programs and the exchange of best practices among member states.

3. Improving migration management: The increased budget will support the development of effective asylum and migration management systems in member states, promoting the fair treatment of applicants and fostering the integration of refugees within host communities. Additionally, resources will be allocated to combat human smuggling and trafficking networks, and to provide humanitarian assistance to migrants in distress.

4. Supporting fundamental rights and the rule of law: The budget increase will ensure that the EU continues to closely monitor and address any breaches of fundamental rights, whether occurring within member states or outside its borders. This includes financing projects to combat discrimination, racism, and xenophobia, as well as ensuring the respect of rule of law principles in the member states.

5. Enhancing administrative and financial management capacities: Lastly, the additional funds will contribute to building more robust and efficient public administrations in the member states, ultimately benefiting European citizens through improved public service delivery and more transparent and accountable decision-making processes.

In conclusion, the increase of the budget allocated to Section 18 - the Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice - will play a crucial role in promoting a more secure, fair, and inclusive Europe. The additional resources will foster greater cooperation among member states, improve the management of migration flows, and strengthen the rule of law, ultimately contributing to a better and safer environment for the European Union and its citizens.
