Question: There are 10 cars parked in a mallâ€™s parking lot, each with the same number of customers inside. Each customer only makes 1 purchase. If the sports store makes 20 sales and the music store makes 30 sales, how many customers are in each of the cars?
Answer: As each sale represents a customer, there must be a total of 20 sports store sales + 30 music store sales = 50 customers. There is an equal number of customers in every car, so there must be 50 total customers / 10 cars = 5 customers in each car. The answer is 5.
[Question]The school nurse must conduct lice checks at the elementary school. She must check 26 Kindergarteners, 19 first graders, 20 second graders, and 25 third graders. If each check takes 2 minutes, how many hours will it take the nurse to complete all the checks?
[Answer]The school nurse must check a total of 26 Kindergarteners + 19 first graders + 20 second graders + 25 third graders = 90 students in all. If every check takes 2 minutes, it will take 90 students x 2 minutes = 180 minutes. There are 60 minutes in one hour, so it will take 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours to complete the checks. The answer is 3.
Q: A factory produces 90 refrigerators per hour. It also produces 70 more coolers than refrigerators per hour. How many products did the factory produce for 5 days if it works 9 hours a day?
A: The factory produces 90 + 70 = 160 coolers per hour. The factory works 5 * 9 = 45 hours in 5 days. The factory produces ( 90 + 160) * 45 = 11250 products for 5 days. The answer is 11250.
Question: Lisa bought a new iPhone for $1000. She bought a phone contract that costs $200/month, a case that costs 20% of the cost of the phone, and headphones that cost half as much as the case. How much will Lisa spend on her phone in the first year?
Answer: First find the cost of the case: $1000 * 20% = $200. Then find the cost of the headphones: $200 / 2 = $100. Then find how much the phone contract will cost over a year: $200 / month * 12 months / year = $2400. Finally, add the cost of the phone, accessories, and plan over the first year to find the total: $2400 + $100 + $200 + $1000 = $3700. The answer is 3700.
[Question]It takes Emmalyn and her research team, the Polar Bears, 30 minutes to fully navigate around a volcanic island. On Saturday, they decided to start off by rounding the island once. They then re-grouped and planned out the rest of their weekend research schedule. They completed 10 more round that day and then went home. When they came on Sunday, they were able to complete 15 rounds. Calculate the total time, in minutes, the Polar Bears spent circling the island over that weekend.
[Answer]On the first day, they started off doing one round of 30 minutes. The team did ten more rounds on day one which took 10 * 30 = 300 minutes. The total time they took circumnavigating the land on the first day is 300 + 30 = 330 minutes. On the second day, they did 15 rounds, which took 30 minutes each, giving 15 * 30 = 450 minutes. The total number of rounds took 330 + 450 = 780 minutes. The answer is 780.
