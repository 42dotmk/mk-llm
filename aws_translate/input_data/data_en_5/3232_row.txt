suitcase was already packed to the brim with clothes, toiletries, and other essentials for her long journey ahead. In fact, as she stood there staring at the colorful wide-brimmed hat, she couldn't help but feel a pang of frustration welling up inside her. The sombrero, with its vibrant patterns and playful tassels, had been a thoughtful gift from her best friend, Mariana, as a farewell token before she embarked on this once in a lifetime trip.

For a moment, she contemplated the idea of pulling out a few items from the suitcase and attempting a repacking strategy to create space for the sombrero, but quickly shook her head at the impractical notion. Her suitcase was already bulging at the seams, and the clothing tightly packed like perfectly arranged Tetris pieces. Not to mention, she had spent hours meticulously packing and organizing it in the first place, making sure she had her outfits planned, and her essential items readily accessible.

She glanced down at the sombrero again, running her fingers softly along the edge of the circular rim. The sombrero had come to represent a blend of her past, present, and future. It reflected the beautiful memories she had shared with Mariana back home in their tight-knit community and the cultural bond that would always connect them. Furthermore, it symbolized the exciting adventure that lay ahead in her travels, the new experiences she would accumulate, and the stories she would later have to share with Mariana.

As she pondered in silence, she knew she couldn't just leave the sombrero behind to collect dust on a shelf, nor did she want to miss out on the warm nostalgia it would provide during her journey. She knew how much it meant to her, and she knew there had to be a solution. That's when inspiration struck her.

She quickly rummaged through her carry-on bag and pulled out a large, sturdy carabiner â€“ the one she had brought to secure her water bottle to her backpack during long hikes. With a jolt of newfound determination, she attached the carabiner to the crown strap of the sombrero, making sure it was secure and wouldn't slip off during the bustling airport hustle.

Then, she took the free end of the carabiner and clipped it onto the handle of her suitcase. The sombrero now dangled comfortably on the side of her luggage, safely attached and easily accessible. A broad smile spread across her face as she marveled at her ingenuity and problem-solving skills.

As she wheeled her suitcase out the door and towards the awaiting cab, the sombrero swung jauntily with each step, revealing glimpses of her colorful heritage and the bond she shared with Mariana. The sombrero's presence turned out to be a wonderful conversation starter with curious fellow travelers, locals, and even flight attendants. It became a symbol of friendship, pride, and adventure, accompanying her in every new landscape and experience, as if Mariana was with her in spirit, cheering her on.

At every destination, she would take photos with her beloved sombrero, allowing it to be a constant reminder of the cherished memories and, at the same time, an integral part of her unfolding journey. And when she returned home, she would have even more stories to share, reunited with Mariana under the wide, protective brim of their unbreakable connection.
