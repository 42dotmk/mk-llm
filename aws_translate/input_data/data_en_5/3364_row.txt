The premise and hypothesis presented connect the idea that a lack of attention towards governmental monitoring of our data streams may lead to further invasions of privacy. In order to comprehensively analyze whether the premise entails the hypothesis, it is essential to examine each element of the argument and break down the possible implications and scenarios. 

First, let's dissect the premise:
"Attention must be paid lest the government further encroach on the privacy of our data streams."

This statement implies that a lack of vigilance or monitoring efforts could result in the government expanding its access to private data. It could encompass various forms of data, such as personal communications, browsing history, financial transactions, among others. This premise calls for an awareness of the risks and potential consequences tied to the invasion of privacy by the government. It suggests that by not addressing this issue, individuals put themselves in a vulnerable position, where their privacy could be compromised.

Now, let's analyze the hypothesis:
"If attention isn't paid, the government will continue to spy."

This statement proposes that if people do not pay attention to the government's potential overreaching into private data, the government will continue to surveil, monitor, and access the personal information of individuals without consequences. The hypothesis asserts a rather deterministic outcome, implying that government monitoring will persist if the issue is not addressed.

To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we must consider the logical connection between the two. 

The primary link between the premise and the hypothesis is the idea of attention or awareness of the problem: with the premise emphasizing the necessity of attention to prevent further governmental encroachment, and the hypothesis suggesting that it will continue if the issue remains unaddressed. Consequently, the natural corollary would be that paying attention is critical to putting a halt to the unwanted invasion of privacy.

However, it is worth noting that the premise alone does not guarantee the government will stop encroaching on privacy. It may only create resistance or spark a discussion regarding the issue. The relationship between the premise and hypothesis suggests that if awareness is raised and the societal concern is voiced, it may increase the likelihood of impeding government monitoring.

In conclusion, the premise and the hypothesis are related but not completely inseparable. While the premise calls for attention to be paid to thwart the extension of government surveillance, the hypothesis suggests that governmental spying will persist if the matter remains ignored. Thus, it can be inferred that the premise entails the hypothesis to an extent, with the logical connection between the two emphasizing the need for vigilance and awareness in order to confront the issue of encroachment on privacy by the government and potentially hinder further invasions. Nonetheless, the premise by itself does not provide any guarantees, and a more comprehensive approach to curbing the invasive tendencies of the government should involve not just attention but also decisive actions by citizens and legislative efforts to create protective boundaries for personal data.
