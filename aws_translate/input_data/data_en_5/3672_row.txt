[Question]The gummy bear factory manufactures 300 gummy bears a minute. Each packet of gummy bears has 50 gummy bears inside. How long would it take for the factory to manufacture enough gummy bears to fill 240 packets, in minutes?
[Answer]The factory creates 300 gummy bears a minute, which means it produces 300 / 50 = 6 packets of gummy bears per minute. It would take 240 / 6 = 40 minutes to manufacture enough gummy bears to fill 240 packets. The answer is 40.
Q: Bobby needs to buy a new pair of fancy shoes. He decides to go to a cobbler and get them handmade. The cobbler charges $250 to make the mold. He then charges $75 an hour for 8 hours to make the shoes. The cobbler agrees to only charge 80% of the cost for work to make the shoes, since it is his first pair of shoes. How much did Bobby pay?
A: The cost of labor is 75 * 8 = $600. So Bobby pays 600 * .8 = $480. So that means Bobby pays 480 + 250 = $730. The answer is 730.
Question: Casey wants to decorate her toenails and fingernails. First, she wants to do a base coat on each nail, then a coat of paint and finally a coat of glitter on every nail. It takes 20 minutes to apply each coat and 20 minutes for each coat to dry before applying the next one. Assuming Casey's nails will be done when all coats have been applied and dried, how many minutes will it take her to finish decorating her fingernails and toenails?
Answer: Casey wants to paint her 10 toenails + 10 fingernails = 20 nails in total. First she wants to do a base coat which takes 20 minutes to apply + 20 minutes to dry = 40 minutes total for the first coat. It will take the same amount of time to do a coat of paint and let it dry and to do a coat of glitter and let it dry, 40 minutes x 3 different coats = 120 minutes total to paint her toenails and fingernails. The answer is 120.
[Question]Jim collects model cars, and he has 301 models total. Jim has 4 times as many Buicks as Fords, and 3 more than twice the number of Fords than Chevys. How many Buicks does Jim have?
[Answer]Let x represent the number of Chevys. Fords:3 + 2x. Buicks:4(3 + 2x) = 12 + 8x. Total:x + 3 + 2x + 12 + 8x = 301. 11x + 15 = 301. 11x = 286. x = 26. Buicks:12 + 8(26) = 220. The answer is 220.
Q: Danai is decorating her house for Halloween. She puts 12 plastic skulls all around the house. She has 4 broomsticks, 1 for each side of the front and back doors to the house. She puts up 12 spiderwebs around various areas of the house. Danai puts twice as many pumpkins around the house as she put spiderwebs. She also places a large cauldron on the dining room table. If Danai has the budget left to buy 20 more decorations and has 10 left to put up, how many decorations will she put up in all?
A: Danai places 12 skulls + 4 broomsticks + 12 spiderwebs + 1 cauldron = 29 decorations. She also puts up twice as many pumpkins around the house as she put spiderwebs, 12 x 2 = 24 pumpkins. Danai will also add 20 + 10 decorations to the 29 + 24 decorations already up = 83 total decorations Danai will put up. The answer is 83.
