[Question]To finish the task assigned to her by the work supervisor in the stipulated deadline, Anie needs 5 hours extra aside from the normal work schedule each day. If each day her work schedule requires her to be productive for 10 hours, and the project is estimated to take 1500 hours, calculate the number of days it would take Anie to finish the job.
[Answer]Every day, in addition to her 10 - hour work schedule, Anie needs 5 extra hours, which means she works 10 + 5 = 15 hours each day. If the project is estimated to take 1500 hours, Anie will need to work for 1500 / 15 = 100 days to complete the project. The answer is 100.
Q: Haley, Michael and Brandon were trying a marshmallow challenge to see who could hold more marshmallows in their mouths. Haley could hold 8 marshmallows in her mouth. Michael could hold 3 times as many marshmallows as Haley. Brandon could hold half as many as Michael. How many total marshmallows did all three kids hold in their mouths?
A: Haley held 8 marshmallows. Michael held 3 times Haley's, so he held 8 x 3 = 24 marshmallows. Brandon held half as many marshmallows as Michael, so he held 24 / 2 = 12 marshmallows. Together, they held 8 + 24 + 12 = 44 marshmallows. The answer is 44.
Question: Nine adults went to a play with seven children. Adult tickets are $11 each and children's tickets are $7 each. How many dollars more did the adults' tickets cost in total than the children's tickets in total?
Answer: Adults = 9 * 11 = 99. Children = 7 * 7 = 49. Difference: 99 - 49 = $50. The adults' tickets cost $50 more than the children's tickets. The answer is 50.
[Question]Carter has a jar with 20 green M&Ms and 20 red M&Ms. He eats 12 of the green M&Ms, then his sister comes and eats half the red M&Ms and adds 14 yellow M&Ms. If Carter picks an M&M at random now, what is the percentage chance he'll get a green M&M?
[Answer]First find the final number of green M&Ms by subtracting 12 from the starting number: 20 M&Ms - 12 M&Ms = 8 green M&Ms. Then find the final number of red M&Ms by dividing the starting number by half: 20 M&Ms / 2 = 10 red M&Ms. Then find the total number of M&Ms at the end by adding the number of red, green and yellow M&Ms: 8 M&Ms + 10 M&Ms + 14 M&Ms = 32 M&Ms. Then divide the number of green M&Ms by the total number of M&Ms and multiply by 100 to find the percentage chance Carter gets a green M&M: 8 M&Ms / 32 M&Ms * 100 = 25%. The answer is 25.
Q: Tom originally was only able to lift 80 kg farmer handles per hand. After some training, he was able to double this number. He then decided to specialize and was able to get an extra 10%. How much weight can he hold in total?
A: After doubling he was able to hold 80 * 2 = 160 kg per hand. Specialization gave him another 160 * .1 = 16 kg. So he lifted 160 + 16 = 176 kg per hand. That means he lifted a total of 352 kg. The answer is 352.
