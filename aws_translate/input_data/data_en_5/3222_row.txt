Cicero delivered it in 63 BC in the Roman Senate, passionately addressing the threat posed by the radical leader Catiline, who he believed was subverting the republic, undermining the rule of law, and ultimately leading to its downfall. Cruz's reference to the ancient orator serves as a stark reminder of the dangers that political leaders face when they attempt to overstep their bounds and undermine the foundations of democracy, as he clearly insinuates President Obama has done with his executive orders. Drawing on the historical significance and impact of Cicero's speech, the Senator from Texas uses it as a powerful tool in underlining the importance of preserving America's democratic values and upholding the Constitution. In a deeply polarized political environment, Cruz's choice of rhetoric might be seen as an attempt to bridge the gap between parties and unite them under a common cause – the protection of the American Republic.

Cruz's decision to invoke Cicero can be interpreted in several ways. On one hand, he might be seen as paying homage to the classical roots of American democracy, with an intent to assert the continuity between ancient Rome and contemporary America, both being powerful republics with strong political institutions. On the other hand, the reference to Cicero highlights a prevalent issue in the American political debate: the challenge of balancing executive power and respecting the principle of separation of powers.

As the debate on immigration policy continues to divide the Senate, Cruz's speech emphasizes the need for legislators to address the issue carefully and with respect for the constitutional limits placed upon their authority. In this respect, the comparison between Obama's actions and the threats posed by Catiline can be seen as a cautionary tale – a reminder of the dangerous consequences that may result from reckless political decisions. Whether one agrees or disagrees with Cruz's perspective on immigration, it is clear that his use of Cicero's words highlights the ongoing relevance of ancient political wisdom in the contemporary context.

While some may criticize Cruz as being overly dramatic in his apparent equating of Obama's actions with the collapse of the Roman Republic, others may see it as a fitting tribute to the ongoing battle for the soul of America and the importance of maintaining a careful balance of power. Regardless of personal opinions, the Senator's speech, steeped in historical resonance and eloquent rhetoric, serves as a poignant reminder of the longstanding American tradition of building upon the rich intellectual legacy of ancient philosophers and statesmen in the pursuit of democratic ideals. It reflects the fragile nature of republics and the dangers of undermining their foundational principles.

In sum, Senator Ted Cruz's adaptation of Cicero's address on the Senate floor underscores the enduring power of classical rhetoric in American politics and serves as a cautionary tale about the potential dangers of executive overreach. The historical and symbolic weight of the speech, delivered "almost verbatim" to the original, offers a timely reminder of the significance of preserving the core principles that underpin American democracy – in the face of divisive issues such as immigration policy.
