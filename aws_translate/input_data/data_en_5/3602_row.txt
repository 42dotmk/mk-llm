[Question]James creates a media empire. He creates a movie for $2000. Each DVD cost $6 to make. He sells it for 2.5 times that much. He sells 500 movies a day for 5 days a week. How much profit does he make in 20 weeks?
[Answer]He sold each DVD for 6 * 2.5 = $15. So he makes a profit of 15 - 6 = $9. So each day he makes a profit of 9 * 500 = $4500. So he makes 4500 * 5 = $22,500. He makes 22,500 * 20 = $450,000. Then after the cost of creating the movie he has a profit of 450,000 - 2000 = $448,000. The answer is 448000.
Q: 4/5 of the Easter eggs are blue and 1/5 are purple. Half the purple eggs have five pieces of candy each, and 1/4 of the blue eggs do. The rest of the eggs only have one piece of candy. If Jerry opens one egg at random, what is the percentage chance he'll get 5 pieces of candy?
A: First find the probability Jerry gets a blue egg with 5 pieces of candy by multiplying the independent probabilities: 4 / 5 * 1 / 4 = 1 / 5 = 20%. Then find the probability he gets a purple egg with 5 pieces of candy the same way: 1 / 5 * 1 / 2 = 1 / 10 = 10%. Then add the probabilities of the two possible ways to get 5 pieces of candy to find the total probability: 20% + 10% = 30%. The answer is 30.
Question: On her birthday, Avianna bought red candles and blue candles in the ratio of 5:3. If Avianna had 45 red candles on her birthday, how many blue candles did she have?
Answer: If the ratio of red candles to blue candles Avianna bought was 5:3, then the total ratio was 5 + 3 = 8. If 5 represented 45 candles in the total ratio, then 8, the actual ratio, represents 8 * 45 = 360 divided by 5 is 360 / 5 = 72 candles. If the total number of candles was 72, then the number of blue candles is 72 candles - 45 candles = 27 candles. The answer is 27.
[Question]Tom fills a 250 pound sandbag 80% full. But the filling material he is using is 40% heavier than sand. How much does the bag weigh?
[Answer]The bag full of sand would weigh 250 * .8 = 200 pounds. The filling material would make it 200 * .4 = 80 pounds heavier. So it weighs 200 + 80 = 280 pounds. The answer is 280.
Q: Rodney is a door-to-door salesman trying to sell home security systems. He gets a commission of $25 for each system he sells. He is canvassing a neighborhood of four streets with eight houses each. The first street gave him half the sales that the second street did, while every house on the third street turned him away and the fourth street resulted in only one sale. His total commission was $175. How many security systems did he sell on the second street?
A: Let S be the number of systems Rodney sold on the first street. He sold 2S systems on the second street. Based on his commission, he sold 175 / 25 = 7 systems. In all, he sold S + 2S + 0 + 1 = 3S + 1 = 7 systems. On the first and second streets, he sold 3S = 7 - 1 = 6 systems. Thus, on the first street he sold S = 6 / 3 = 2 systems. On the second street, Rodney sold 2 * 2 = 4 security systems. The answer is 4.
