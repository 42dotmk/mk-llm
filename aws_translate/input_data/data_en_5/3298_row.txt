[Question]To make fried green tomatoes, Thelma cuts each green tomato into 8 slices before cooking them up. If 20 slices of fried green tomato make a meal for a single person, how many tomatoes will Thelma need to make enough fried green tomatoes to feed a family of 8 for a single meal?
[Answer]If 20 slices are sufficient for a meal to feed a single person, then to feed eight Thelma will need 8 * 20 = 160 slices of tomato. At 8 slices per tomato, Thelma will need 160 / 8 = 20 tomatoes to feed a family of 8. The answer is 20.
Q: Billy has $25 less than twice the money Sam has. If Sam has $75, how much money do they have together?
A: Billy has $25 less than twice Sam's money, or 2 * $75 - $25 = $150 - $25 = $125. Together they have $75 + $125 = $200. The answer is 200.
Question: Liz roasts 2 16 pounds turkeys every Thanksgiving. She can only roast them 1 at a time because she has a small oven. She roasts each turkey for 15 minutes per pound. If dinner is served at 6:00 pm what is the latest time she can start roasting the turkeys?
Answer: She bakes a turkey for 15 minutes a pound and the turkey is 16 pounds so it takes 15 * 16 = 240 minutes. She has 2 turkeys to roast and one turkey takes 240 minutes to cook so 2 turkeys will take 2 * 240 = 480 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour and these turkeys will take 480 minutes to cook so that's 480 / 60 = 8 hours. In military time, 6:00 pm is 18:00 hours (12 hours + 6 hours) and it takes 8 hours to cook the turkeys so the latest she can start is 18 - 8 = 10:00 am. The answer is 10.
[Question]Oliver had $9, then he saved $5 from his allowance and spent $4 on a frisbee and $3 on a puzzle. His friend gives him another $8 as it's his birthday. How much money does Oliver have left?
[Answer]The total amount of money saved is $9 + $5 = $14. The total cost of the frisbee and the puzzle is $4 + $3 = $7. So Oliver has $14 - $7 = $7 left. His friend gives him $8, so now he has $7 + $8 = $15. The answer is 15.
Q: Joyce, Michael, Nikki, and Ryn have a favorite movie. Joyce's favorite movie is 2 hours longer than Michael's movie. Nikki's movie is three times as long as Michael's movie, and Ryn's favorite movie is 4/5 times as long as Nikki's favorite movie. If Nikki's favorite movie is 30 hours long, calculate the total number of hours of their favorite movies together.
A: Since Nikki's favorite movie is 30 hours long, Ryn's favorite movie is 4 / 5 * 30 = 24 hours long. The total number of hours for Nikki's and Ryn's favorite movies is 24 + 30 = 54 hours long. Nikki's movie is also three times as long as Michael's favorite movie, meaning Michael's favorite movie is 30 / 3 = 10 hours long. Together, Nikki, Ryn, and Michael's favorite movies are 54 + 10 = 64 hours long. If Joyce's favorite movie is 2 hours longer than Michael's favorite movie, then her favorite movie is 10 + 2 = 12 hours long. The length of Nikki, Ryn, Michael, and Joyce's favorite movies is 64 + 12 = 76 hours. The answer is 76.
