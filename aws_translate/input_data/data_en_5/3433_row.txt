his departure from the band in 1979. As Fela continued to use his music as a platform to challenge military dictatorship and government corruption in Nigeria, tensions between the band and the authorities escalated, culminating in a series of violent police raids, arrests, and a tragic attack on Fela's commune, known as the Kalakuta Republic.

During this turbulent period, the atmosphere surrounding the band became increasingly hostile and dangerous. In addition to the police harassment, there were internal conflicts within the band, as some members struggled to cope with the escalating violence and constant scrutiny. Despite their phenomenal success and the groundbreaking nature of their music, it became clear that the band's future was in jeopardy.

It was around this time that Tony Allen decided it was time to move on and forge his own career. He relocated to London, where he formed a new band called the Tony Allen Organization and began to collaborate with other artists, exploring different musical styles and genres. This marked a major turning point in his career, as he stepped out of Fela's shadow and began to establish himself as an acclaimed musician in his own right.

In the years that followed, Allen continued to perform and record with various artists from around the world, further expanding his musical range and influence. He developed a unique fusion of Afrobeat, jazz, and electronic music, making him a sought-after contributor to numerous projects, and enabling him to work with notable musicians like Damon Albarn, Grace Jones, and Jeff Mills, among others.

Simultaneously, Fela Kuti's political activism continued to intensify, as he became an increasingly prominent and outspoken figure in Nigeria's struggle for democracy. Despite serving multiple jail terms and facing ongoing persecution from the authorities, Fela remained a vital and influential voice for change in his country, inspiring a new generation of musicians and activists. Sadly, Fela passed away in 1997, leaving a profound musical and socio-political legacy that continues to resonate today.

As for Tony Allen, his groundbreaking work in Afrobeat and his innovative collaborations with other artists ensured that his impact extended well beyond his time with Fela Kuti. He released a series of successful solo albums, and in 2006, he was invited to join the influential band The Good, the Bad & the Queen, with Damon Albarn, Paul Simonon, and Simon Tong â€“ further testament to his enduring musical prowess.

Allen's perseverance and immense talent enabled him to navigate the challenges and setbacks of his career, ultimately carving out a remarkable and enduring artistic legacy. His death in April 2020 was met with an outpouring of tributes from musicians and fans alike, highlighting the lasting influence of both his work with Fela Kuti and his rich, innovative contributions to the world of music.

In conclusion, the most logical completion of the news story would be that Tony Allen's departure from Fela Kuti's band was primarily due to the volatile political situation and his desire to explore new musical horizons. His subsequent collaborations with numerous acclaimed musicians and his success as a solo artist attest to the lasting impact of his talent and creativity in the world of Afrobeat and beyond.
