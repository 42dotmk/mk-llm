Taking into account the specifics of your request, the continuation of the story will involve us delving back into our playground days, recounting the gradual change in Barend and his descent into becoming a killer.

One of our favorite games as children was playing 'Secret Agent'. We transformed from ordinary school kids to superhuman spies, saving the world from the dangerous villains we imagined. The most attractive aspect of this game was the element of danger and thrill it presented us. Little did I know then that this game was a prelude to the gloomy future Barend would end up having.

Barend was a creative player, inventing intricate stories of international espionage missions where we had to use cunning tactics to defeat our enemies. He always took things a step further, executing imaginary enemies ruthlessly. As a child, I found it slightly disconcerting, but dismissed it as a product of an overactive imagination.

During our teenage years, Barend's love for danger and thrill didn't subside. It only intensified, but this wasn't surprising. Most of our friends were diving headfirst into youthful rebellion; the more outgoing ones picked up skateboarding, surfing, and graffiti, while the more reserved ones like Barend seeped into the deeper corners of the internet, indulging in increasingly graphic and disturbing content.

Barend’s first brush with killing wasn’t as dramatic as one might expect. It began with a pet hamster. It accidentally got crushed when Barend was rearranging his room. But the lack of remorse, the curious dissection, and the clandestine burial was what raised the alarms. I felt a creeping sense of discomfort, which only grew when a neighborhood cat mysteriously disappeared shortly after–only to be discovered weeks later in Barend’s backyard, similar clandestine burial.

I don’t have a detailed account of each murder Barend committed. We drifted apart when he started delving into the macabre like a moth drawn to a flame. I couldn’t relate to, nor condone, his actions. But as the news unfurled the gruesome details of his misdeeds, I found myself haunted by the memory of the young boy with the fascinating shadow, and burdened with the knowledge that this was the same person.

The playground now stands as an eerie reminder of Barend—once an eccentric friend, now a notorious serial killer—and the fading glow of our childhood innocence. Each rusted swing and neglected monkey bar harbors the memories of our naive games, which were once dominated by creativity and shadowed with beautiful innocence, only to be corrupted by the dark cloud of Barend's future endeavors.

Lastly, during the interrogation, I recall a peculiar detail associated with Barend. When asked about routine hacking tools or weapons, he instead pointed towards his lunch, a heavily meat-based diet that was always his preference. He said it gave him the strength and the keen sense of death. This disturbing correlation between murderous tendencies and his food habits served as an obscure revelation into the complexity of his criminal mindset.

So, that's the journey of how Barend, my playground friend, turned into a dreaded murderer. His shadow, once artwork, now symbolizes a grim silhouette of the horror his acts bestow, forever changing my perception of our past friendship.
