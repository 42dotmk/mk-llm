The word used by Christians for the suffering and death of Jesus Christ is "Passion." The term traces its etymology back to the Latin word "passio," which means "suffering" or "enduring." In the context of the life of Jesus, the Passion specifically refers to the events and episodes leading up to and including His crucifixion.

To provide a comprehensive understanding of the Passion, it is essential to outline the key events narrated in the four Gospels–Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John–which chronicle Jesus' final moments. Although the Gospels differ in some details and emphasis, they collectively present a poignant portrayal of the Passion of Jesus Christ.

1. The Last Supper: Before the suffering and crucifixion, Jesus shared a final meal with His disciples, now known as the Last Supper. This gathering is significant in Christianity as it is when Jesus instituted the sacrament of the Holy Eucharist, symbolized by the breaking of bread and sharing of wine, which represent His body and blood.

2. The Agony in the Garden: After the Last Supper, Jesus went to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray. He was in deep distress, aware of the impending betrayal and the suffering to come. During this time, Jesus prayed to God, asking for strength to endure the painful ordeal.

3. The Betrayal by Judas and Arrest: One of Jesus' disciples, Judas Iscariot, had agreed to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. Led by temple guards and Roman soldiers, Judas identified Jesus with a traitorous kiss, leading to His arrest.

4. The Trials: Jesus was subjected to a series of trials that started with a preliminary hearing before the Sanhedrin (the Jewish supreme council) and the high priest. He was then presented to Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea. Pilate initially found no guilt in Jesus and sent Him to Herod Antipas, ruler of Galilee. Unsuccessful in eliciting a confession, Antipas subsequently returned Jesus to Pilate, who eventually yielded to the crowd's demand to crucify Jesus in place of the criminal Barabbas.

5. The Scourging and Crowning with Thorns: Before crucifixion, Jesus was brutally beaten and scourged by Roman soldiers in an act of severe physical torture. In a cruel mockery of His claim to be the "King of the Jews," the soldiers adorned Jesus with a purple robe and a crown made of thorns, causing unbearable pain and humiliation.

6. The Crucifixion and Death: Carrying the heavy wooden cross, Jesus was led to Golgotha (also known as the Place of the Skull) to be nailed to the cross alongside two criminals. Jesus endured unimaginable pain and suffering on the cross for several hours before He ultimately surrendered His spirit to God and passed away.

7. The Burial: After His death, Jesus' body was taken down from the cross, wrapped in a burial shroud, and placed in a tomb donated by a wealthy follower, Joseph of Arimathea.

The Passion is central to Christian belief because it exemplifies Jesus' ultimate act of self-sacrifice for the spiritual redemption of humanity. This event, along with Jesus' subsequent resurrection, forms the basis of Christian faith and salvation. The Passion is observed and commemorated by Christians around the world, particularly during Holy Week–the final week of Lent–culminating in the solemn observance of Good Friday, the day on which Jesus was crucified.
