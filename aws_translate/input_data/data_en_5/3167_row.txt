The case of Mueller v. Oregon, 208 U.S. 412 (1908), represents a pivotal moment in the American labor movement and in the development of constitutional law. In this case, the state of Oregon successfully defended the constitutionality of a state law that limited the working hours of women in certain industries, most notably laundries and factories. 

The plaintiff, Curt Mueller, owned and operated a laundry business in Portland, Oregon. He was fined for violating a state law that set a maximum limit of 10 hours for a single day's work for females. Mueller challenged the constitutionality of the law, arguing that it violated the principle of "liberty of contract" enshrined in the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Liberty of contract was a popular legal doctrine at the time, which effectively held that individuals should be free to negotiate employment contracts without government intervention.

The case ultimately reached the United States Supreme Court, which was faced with deciding whether the Oregon regulation was consistent with the federal Constitution. Oregon was represented by Louis D. Brandeis, who would later become a distinguished justice on the Supreme Court. In defending Oregon's law, Brandeis took an innovative approach known as a "Brandeis brief," which emphasized the social, economic, and scientific reasons for the legislation rather than focusing solely on legal doctrine.

Brandeis argued that it was within the state's police power to regulate labor conditions for the protection of public health, safety, and morals. He presented overwhelming evidence documenting the physical and psychological toll that long working hours took on women, showing that such regulation was a justified exercise of the state's authority in ensuring the general welfare. Additionally, he demonstrated that curtailing women's working hours would have a positive impact on families, communities, and the economy at large.

The Supreme Court, in a 9-0 unanimous decision, upheld Oregon's law. Justice David Brewer delivered the opinion of the Court, finding that the state's interest in protecting women's health justified limitations on their working hours. He acknowledged the vast array of medical and sociological evidence presented by Brandeis, which underscored the need for such protective legislation. The Court held that the state had a legitimate public interest in safeguarding the health of women workers, and that the law was an appropriate means of achieving that end.

The ruling in Mueller v. Oregon represented a significant victory for progressive reformers and for the regulation of industrial labor on behalf of worker protection. The Court's willingness to consider social, economic, and scientific evidence in determining the constitutionality of labor regulations opened the door for further protective measures in the future. However, it is important to note that the Court's reasoning was grounded in the belief that women were inherently weaker and in need of special protection, reinforcing gender stereotypes and inequality in that era. As society and the understanding of gender roles have evolved, the legal basis for sustaining such laws has shifted, yet the case remains a landmark in the development of American constitutional law and labor policy.
