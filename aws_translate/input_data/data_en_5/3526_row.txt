[Question]As Dan is learning to screen-print t-shirts to sell at the craft fair, he makes t-shirts, over the first hour, at the rate of one every 12 minutes. Then, in the second hour, he makes one at the rate of every 6 minutes. How many t-shirts does he make over the course of those two hours?
[Answer]He made 60 / 12 = 5 the first hour. He made 60 / 6 = 10 the second hour. He made 5 + 10 = 15. The answer is 15.
Q: A pastry chef is making brownies but is running out of butter. The recipe he is following calls for 2 ounces of butter for every 1 cup of baking mix; however, it allows 2 ounces of coconut oil to be substituted for the 2 ounces of butter if necessary. The chef would like to use as much butter as possible before switching over and substituting coconut oil. If the chef had 4 ounces of butter remaining, and he plans on using 6 cups of baking mix, how many ounces of coconut oil will he end up using?
A: Every 2 ounces of butter is enough to cover 1 cup of baking mix, so the chef's remaining 4 ounces of butter will be enough to cover 4 / 2 = 2 cups of baking mix. This leaves 6 - 2 = 4 cups of baking mix that will require the use of coconut oil as a substitute. Since each cup of baking mix requires 2 ounces of coconut oil, these 4 cups will require a total of 4 * 2 = 8 ounces of coconut oil. The answer is 8.
Question: Jeremy bought a computer for $3000, and some accessories for 10% of the price of the computer. How much money has Jeremy if, before the purchase, he had two times more money, than the cost of the computer itself?
Answer: At the start, Jeremy had two times more money than the price of the computer, which means he had 2 * 3000 = $6000. The cost of the accessories stands at 3000 * 1 / 10 = $300. This leaves Jeremy with 6000 - 3000 - 300 = $2700. The answer is 2700.
[Question]Shane wants to take as many photos as possible this year. He takes 146 photos in the first 2 months of the year. In January, he takes 2 photos every day. The rest of the photos were taken in February. If in February he took an equal number of photos each week, how many photos did Shane take each week in February?
[Answer]Shane takes a total of 2 photos / day * 31 days = 62 photos in January. This means he must have taken 146 total photos – 62 January photos = 84 photos in February. As he took an equal number each week, he must have taken 84 photos / 4 weeks = 21 photos each week. The answer is 21.
Q: To celebrate a recent promotion, Arthur decided to treat himself to dinner at a nice restaurant. He ordered a nice appetizer for $8, a delicious ribeye steak for his entrée at $20, had two glasses of nice red wine with dinner for $3 each, and a slice of caramel cheesecake for dessert for $6. He used a voucher for half off the price of his entrée, but he very thoughtfully tipped his waitress a full 20% of what the full cost of his meal would have been without the discount. How much, including the tip, did Arthur spend on dinner?
A: The cost of his food, before the voucher, was $8 + $20 + $3 + $3 + $6 = $40. The tip was $40 * .20 = $8. The voucher saved him $20 / 2 = $10. So the full price of Arthur's meal, with tip, was $40 - $10 + 8 = $38. The answer is 38.
