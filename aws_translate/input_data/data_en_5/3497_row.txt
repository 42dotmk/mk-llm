The two questions mentioned are similar, but they are not exactly the same. The first question asks about the differences between C++ and C++11, while the second question asks about the differences between C++11 and Visual C++11. Let's address the differences between the various versions of C++:

1. The Difference between C++ and C++11:

C++11 is an updated version of the C++ programming language introduced in 2011. It offers several new features, improvements, and modifications compared to the prior version of C++. Some of the notable changes introduced in C++11 are:

A. Language Features:
   a. auto keyword: Allows the compiler to deduce the type of a variable, making the code more concise and easier to read.
   b. decltype: A feature that deduces the type of an expression.
   c. nullptr: A new keyword representing a null pointer constant, making code safer and more expressive.
   d. strongly typed enums: Improved enumeration type to provide better type-safety.
   e. static_assert: Compile-time assertions to check for programming errors and inconsistencies early.
   f. Range-based for loop: A new type of loop, making iterating over containers more convenient and readable.
   g. rvalue references and move semantics: Enable more efficient usage of resources, especially when working with temporaries.
   h. variadic templates: Allows the creation of templates that take a variable number of arguments, making it easier to write generic code.
   i. lambda expressions: Anonymous functions that can be defined within the code, improving flexibility and expressiveness of the language.

B. Library Features:
   a. Standardized multithreading support: A set of libraries to ensure that C++ code is portable across different platforms and environments.
   b. Smart pointers: Added to cope with resource management and memory leaks more effectively, including unique_ptr, shared_ptr, and weak_ptr.
   c. Regular expressions: Standard library support for working with regular expressions to parse and manipulate text.
   d. new container classes: Forward list, unordered_map, unordered_set, etc., to address various programming use-cases.
   e. Tuple: A new library type that allows grouping of heterogeneous elements into a single object.
   f. Improved algorithms and random number generation support.

2. The Difference between C++11 and Visual C++11:

The phrase "Visual C++11" could have two different interpretations:

   a. Visual C++ version 11: Referring to Microsoft's Visual Studio 2012 IDE, which supports the C++11 standard and offers additional features specific to the Microsoft ecosystem.
   b. Microsoft's Visual C++ compiler: A compiler that is part of Visual Studio and supports the C++11 standard. The focus is on the compiler rather than the IDE.

The essential difference in the second question is about the features that a specific implementation of the C++11 standard (e.g., the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler) may or may not fully support, as well as additional tooling and library features unique to the Microsoft ecosystem.

In conclusion, the first question asks about differences between two language standards (C++ and C++11), while the second question is about the differences between a language standard (C++11) and a specific development tool (Visual C++11) that implements that standard.
