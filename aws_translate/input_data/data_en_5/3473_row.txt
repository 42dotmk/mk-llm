No, the provided statement would not be a reasonable answer to the question, as it focuses on a later event in 1871 which does not directly address how the 'Bleeding Sumner' incident led to the Civil War. A more accurate and detailed response is provided below.

The "Bleeding Sumner" incident refers to the violent attack on Sen. Charles Sumner by Rep. Preston Brooks in the U.S. Senate in May 1856. This event contributed to rising tensions between the North and South, ultimately leading to the Civil War. To understand how it played a role in the path to the Civil War, it is crucial to look at the broader context of this incident.

The conflict between Sen. Sumner and Rep. Brooks stemmed from a speech Sumner gave on May 19-20, 1856, called "The Crime Against Kansas." In the speech, Sumner criticized the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which allowed the territories to decide if they would be admitted as free or slave states based on popular sovereignty. As a strong abolitionist, Sumner condemned slavery and criticized those who supported it or sought its expansion.

Specifically, Sumner targeted two of his Senate colleagues, Sen. Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois and Sen. Andrew P. Butler of South Carolina, who were both proponents of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and slavery. Sumner's harsh verbal attacks and personal insults towards Butler deeply angered Butler's relative, Rep. Preston Brooks. Feeling that his family's honor was at stake, Rep. Brooks sought retaliation and brutally assaulted Sen. Sumner with a cane on May 22, 1856, causing serious injuries to Sumner.

The "Bleeding Sumner" incident intensified the already strained relations between the North and the South:

1. Highlighted sectional tensions: The incident highlighted the growing divide between Northern and Southern politicians over the issue of slavery. Sumner became a symbol of Northern resolve against slavery and its extension to new territories, while Brooks gained notoriety in the South for his defense of Southern honor and pro-slavery principles.

2. Demonstrated the intensity of the conflict: The violence in the Senate illustrated that the debate over slavery was no longer confined to intellectual or legislative discussionsâ€”physical violence had entered the political discourse, demonstrating the depth of emotions around these issues.

3. Strengthened the resolve of Abolitionists and anti-slavery activists: The attack on Sumner galvanized anti-slavery activists in the North, who pointed to the incident as a sign of Southern brutality and the need for more vigorous opposition to the spread of slavery into new territories.

4. Solidified the positions of both sides: Particularly in the 1856 presidential election, the incident influenced political campaigns and platforms, further polarizing the nation. It solidified the positions of both the North and the South, making it increasingly difficult for compromise on contentious issues like slavery and state sovereignty.

In summary, the "Bleeding Sumner" incident was an important event that contributed to the escalation of tensions between the North and the South in the years leading up to the Civil War. It demonstrated the increasingly violent nature of the political debate around slavery, further polarized the nation, and helped set the stage for the ultimate conflict in 1861.
