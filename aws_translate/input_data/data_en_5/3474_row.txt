Question: Fran is in charge of counting votes for the book club's next book, but she always cheats so her favorite gets picked. Originally, there were 10 votes for Game of Thrones, 12 votes for Twilight, and 20 votes for The Art of the Deal. Fran throws away 80% of the votes for The Art of the Deal and half the votes for Twilight. What percentage of the altered votes were for Game of Thrones?
Answer: First find the total number of The Art of the Deal votes Fran throws away: 80% * 20 votes = 16 votes. Then subtract these votes from the total number of The Art of the Deal votes to find the altered number: 20 votes - 16 votes = 4 votes. Then divide the total number Twilight votes by 2 to find the altered number of votes: 12 votes / 2 = 6 votes. Then add the altered number of votes for each book to find the total altered number of votes: 6 votes + 4 votes + 10 votes = 20 votes. Then divide the number of votes for Game of Thrones by the total altered number of votes and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 10 votes / 20 votes * 100% = 50%. The answer is 50.
[Question]Tom attends a party that collects $2000. Half the school attended and the school had 400 people. How much would they have made if 300 people attended?
[Answer]There were 400 / 2 = 200 people in attendance. So that means each person paid 2000 / 200 = $10. So if 300 people attended they would have made 300 * 10 = $3000. The answer is 3000.

Question: On the weekend, Tony will walk to the store. On weekdays, he runs to the store. When he walks, he goes 2 MPH. When he runs he goes 10 MPH. The store is 4 miles away. If he goes on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, what is the average time in minutes that he spends to get to the store?
Answer: On Sunday he takes 2 hours to get there because 4 / 2 = 2. This takes him 120 minutes because 2 x 60 = 120. On Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him .4 hours to get to the store because 4 / 10 = .4. On Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him 24 minutes to get to the store because .4 x 60 = 24. In total it takes him 168 minutes to get to the store because 120 + 24 + 24 = 168. On average it takes him 56 minutes because 168 / 3 = 56. The answer is 56.
[Question]John's hair grows 1.5 inches every month. Every time it gets to 9 inches long he cuts it down to 6 inches. A haircut costs $45 and he gives a 20% tip. How much does he spend on haircuts a year?
[Answer]He cuts off 9 - 6 = 3 inches when he gets a haircut. That means he needs to cut it every 3 / 1.5 = 2 months. So he gets 12 / 2 = 6 haircuts a year. He gives a 45 * .2 = $9 tip. So that means each hair cut cost 45 + 9 = $54. So he pays 54 * 6 = $324 a year. The answer is 324.
