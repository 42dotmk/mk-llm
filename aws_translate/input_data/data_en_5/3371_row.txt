The answer to both questions asked, "What is the best sword?" and "What is the best type of sword in the world?" would indeed be closely related; however, the answer might not be exactly the same because of how these questions are framed, which focuses on separate aspects of the topic.

In answering "What is the best sword?" it would be important to define what is meant by "best". Is it the sharpest, the most durable, the most historically significant, the most expensive or the most aesthetically pleasing? 'Best' is subjective and can refer to many different factors. For instance, some might argue that historically, the katana, a Japanese longsword used by samurai, is the best due to its sharpness, flexibility, and hardness. Others might argue that the Damascus Sword, known for its unique patterning and legendary sharpness, durability, and resistance to shattering, is the best.

On the other hand, when trying to answer "What is the best type of sword in the world?" we would also need to consider cultural, historical, and practical aspects. Different types of swords have been developed throughout history and across cultures depending on the needs and resources of those societies. A Longsword from medieval Europe, for example, was designed for different kinds of warfare than a Scimitar from the Middle East or a Rapier from Renaissance Europe.

Specific types of swords might include the Katana (Japan), Longsword (Europe), Jian (China), Scimitar (Middle East), Khopesh (Egypt), and Rapier (Renaissance Europe). Each type has distinctive features and was created to meet specific requirements. 

The Katana, for instance, is revered for its sharpness and is best for quick, precise cuts. The Longsword gives the best results in a range of fighting situations due to its balanced design. The Jian excels in precision and agility, making it suitable for subtle techniques as seen in several martial arts. A Scimitar is considered optimal for horseback combat due to its curved design, which is good for slashing. The Khopesh was technologically superior during its time, with its sickle-like shape offering both slashing and hooking capabilities. A Rapier, while limited in slashing effectiveness, is unmatched in offering quick thrusting attacks.

The key point is that the concept of 'the best' can depend largely on the context and the criteria by which 'best' is judged. What works best in one scenario might not work as well in another. Thus, the best sword or sword type is fundamentally determined by what it is that you need or want the sword to do â€“ whether that be display, collection, combat, historical reenactment or something else entirely. Therefore, while the answer to the two questions may indeed be similar, they should also address these individual aspects of each query. The responses could indeed reference the same types of swords based on these factors, but they could also differ based on how 'best' is interpreted in each context. 

The given options (i). no. (ii). yes. do not seem to relate to these questions as they imply a yes or no response. Both questions require a much more nuanced and detailed answer than a simple yes or no. Therefore, focusing purely on these options would neither adequately satisfy the questions nor necessarily provide a logically coherent response.
