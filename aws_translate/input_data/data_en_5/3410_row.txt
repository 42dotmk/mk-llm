Step 5: Build tension and climax
During a highly-anticipated performance, one of the troupe's lead sitar players falls ill, and Christian, still disguised, is asked to take his place on stage. Relying on his natural talent, Christian gives a stellar performance and the audience is mesmerized. Backstage, Riya starts to suspect that Christian is the masked sitar player after hearing him hum a familiar tune.

Step 6: Zidler's revelation
Intrigued by the mysterious player's skill, Zidler starts to investigate his background. The climax occurs when Zidler gathers the troupe together and dramatically reveals that Christian is the disguised sitar player. The troupe members, including Riya, are shocked by the revelation.
