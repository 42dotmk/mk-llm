The Unraveling Enigma of Hope Hicks: A Rare, Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse

New York magazine recently published an extensive profile on Hope Hicks, the former White House Communications Director and presidential aide. The article provides some rare behind-the-scenes glimpses into her life during her tenure at the White House and her close, daughterly relationship with President Trump. Despite the in-depth examination, the piece leaves some readers, such as Ruth Graham at Slate, still puzzled by who Hope Hicks genuinely is.

Hope Hicks, a 29-year-old political advisor, is a rare phenomenon in Washington DC - someone who shunned publicity but also cared deeply about her public image. Olivia Nuzzi, the author of this captivating profile in New York magazine, unfolds the layers of Hicks' life to uncover the events leading up to her decision to resign. The article reveals that Hicks considered resigning twice before finally leaving on February 28th.

Ironically, the elusive nature of Hope Hicks is what meshes with the overall theme of the profile, which emphasizes her enigmatic persona and ability to keep her public image intact even amidst the tumultuous political environment. This apparent contradiction between her desire for privacy and her pursuit of a public career makes Hicks an intriguing subject for a profile.

One of the most compelling aspects of the article is the portrayal of her close relationship with President Trump. Hicks became one of Trump's most trusted confidants during her time at the White House and, according to the profile, he would regularly summon her to his office by shouting, "Hopester!" or "Hopey!" The article delves into the chemistry between Hicks and Trump, highlighting his trust in her advice and her unwavering loyalty to him.

This loyalty is also evident when the article discusses the moment Hicks decided to resign. Apparently, she had prayed a lot over the weekend and had even written a pros and cons list in a notebook about the timing of her resignation, not about whether to resign. At noon that day, she informed Trump of her decision to leave immediately due to her exhaustion from the toxic DC environment, rather than distancing herself from him. In response, Trump interrupted her and expressed his concern for her happiness, understanding her difficult decision, and pledging to help her in any way possible. He simultaneously expressed hopefulness that she would “go make a lot of money” and eventually return to the White House someday.

As the profile comes to a close, it touches upon the high-profile personal relationships that Hicks had during her time at the White House, namely her connections to former Trump aides Rob Porter and Corey Lewandowski. These relationships garnered significant media attention, further fueling the enigmatic aura that surrounds Hope Hicks.

While the article offers an in-depth look into Hope Hicks' life, striving to unravel the enigma, readers may still be left with questions about the true essence of who she is. The mystery surrounding Hicks can be seen as both frustrating and alluring, making her story even more captivating to follow. As she embarks on the next chapter of her life, one thing seems certain: Hope Hicks will continue to captivate and mystify those who try to understand her.
