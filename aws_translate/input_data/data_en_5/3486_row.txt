[Question]Kendra and Laurel have shops that sell different brands of shoe collections. In 2014, Kendra made $8000 less than Laurel made in sales. However, in 2015, Kendra made 20% more money than Laurel made in 2014. If Laurel earned $30000 in 2014, calculate Kendra's total earnings in the two years.
[Answer]In 2015, Kendra's sales were 20 / 100 * $30000 = $6000 more than Laurel's. So, Kendra's total sales for 2015 was $30000 + $6000 = $36000. If Kendra made $8000 less in 2014 than Laurel, she made $30000 - $8000 = $22000 in that year. The total amount of money Kendra made in the two years is $22000 + $36000 = $58000. The answer is 58000.
Q: Jill is painting her 20 toenails and fingernails. She paints 6 of her nails purple, 8 of them blue, and the rest striped. What is the difference in percentage points between the percentage of nails painted blue and the percentage painted striped?
A: First find the total number of striped nails: 20 nails - 6 nails - 8 nails = 6 nails. Then divide the number of blue nails by the number of total nails and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 8 blue nails / 20 total nails * 100% = 40%. Then divide the number of striped nails by the number of total nails and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 6 striped nails / 20 total nails * 100% = 30%. Then subtract the percentage of striped nails from the percentage of blue nails to find the difference: 40% - 30% = 10%. The answer is 10.
Question: Stella collects stamps. She counted 50 pages in her collector's album. There are 5 rows of 30 stamps in each of the first 10 pages of her album. The rest of the pages each have 50 stamps. How many stamps are in Stella's album?
Answer: There are 30 x 5 = 150 stamps on each of the first 10 pages. So she has a total of 150 x 10 = 1500 stamps in the first 10 pages. There are 50 - 10 = 40 pages that have 50 stamps each. There is a total of 40 x 50 = 2000 stamps in the remaining 40 pages. Therefore, Stella has 2000 + 1500 = 3500 stamps in her album. The answer is 3500.
[Question]Cara has 60 marbles in a bag. 20 of them are yellow, half as many are green, and the remaining marbles are equally divided between red and blue. If Cara picks a marble at random, what are the odds it's blue (expressed as a percentage)?
[Answer]First find the number of green marbles: 20 yellow marbles / 2 = 10 green marbles. Then find how many marbles are either red or blue: 60 marbles - 20 yellow marbles - 10 green marbles = 30 marbles. Divide this number in half to find how many marbles are blue: 30 marbles / 2 = 15 blue marbles. Finally, divide the number of blue marbles by the total number of marbles and multiply by 100 to find the percentage chance of getting a blue marble: 15 marbles / 60 marbles * 100 = 25%. The answer is 25.
