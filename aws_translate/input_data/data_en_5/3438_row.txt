 Four Dallas police officers and one Dallas Area Rapid Transit officer were killed when at least one sniper, and potentially more, opened fire on the crowd at the protest on Thursday evening. Three suspects were taken into custody and one was killed by a bomb-carrying robot after an extended stand-off with police. 
  
 In a press conference on Friday morning, Dallas Police Chief David Brown spoke to the grief felt by the entire police force. "We're hurting ... Our profession is hurting. Dallas officers are hurting. We are heartbroken." ||||| As vans from the coroner’s office lined up to transport the bodies of five officers for autopsy, a line of police slowly pulled their hands into a salute. 
  
 The images from the salute — called an honor line — instantly hit social media and spread across the world.

 The number of dead officers could rise as multiple were in critical condition. Police also said two civilians had been shot. 
  
 Seven officers were injured in addition to the five officers who were killed. 
  
 Thompson and the other officers were killed after snipers allegedly opened fire during a protest over two recent fatal police shootings of black men. 
  
 Police had three suspects in custody and had been engaged in a shootout with a fourth. That person, identified as 25-year-old Micah Xavier Johnson, was killed in a parking garage when police detonated an explosive about four hours after the attack began. Authorities say the explosive was attached to a robot to protect officers. 
  
 On Friday, officials said they believe Johnson was the lone shooter. 
  
 Authorities searched for possible explosives in the downtown Dallas area throughout the night.
