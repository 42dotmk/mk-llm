[Question]Lyanna set up a food bank to collect food to give to the homeless in her local town. In the first week, 40 pounds of food were donated to the food bank by the people of her local town. In the second week, donations were twice as high as the first week. If she gave out 70% of the donated food to the homeless in the third week, calculate the amount of food remaining in the food bank.
[Answer]If 40 pounds of food was donated to the food bank in the first week, the second week, which had twice the amount of food donated as the first week, had 2 * 40 = 80 pounds of food. The total amount of food donated to the food bank after the second week is 40 + 80 = 120 pounds. In the third week, she gave to the homeless 70 / 100 * 120 = 84 pounds of food. The total amount of food remaining in the food bank after she gave out 70% to the homeless is 120 - 84 = 36 pounds of food. The answer is 36.
Q: Kekai is running a sundae booth at the carnival. On Monday, he makes a total of 40 sundaes, and he puts 6 m&ms on each sundae. On Tuesday, he makes a total of 20 sundaes, and he puts 10 m&ms on each sundae. If each m&m pack contains 40 m&ms, how many m&m packs does Kekai use?
A: On Monday, Kekai uses 40 * 6 = 240 m&ms. On Tuesday, Kekai uses 20 * 10 = 200 m&ms. Kekai uses a total of 240 + 200 = 440 m&ms. Kekai uses a 440 / 40 = 11 m&m packs. The answer is 11.
Question: There are 180 students in ninth grade. 1/4 of them bombed their finals because they were going through difficult breakups. 1/3rd of the rest didn't show up to take the test, and another 20 got less than a D. How many students passed their finals?
Answer: First find the number of students who went through breakups: 1 / 4 * 180 = 45 students. Then subtract that number from the total number: 180 students - 45 students = 135 students. Then divide that number by 3 to find the number of students who didn't show up to take the test: 135 students / 3 = 45 students. Then subtract the number of students who failed in each way from the total number to find the number who passed: 180 students - 45 students - 45 students - 20 students = 70 students. The answer is 70.

Q: A YouTube video is 100 hours long. Lila decides to watch it at two times the average speed. Roger, her friend, also watch the same video at the average speed. If they both watched six of the same videos, what's the total number of hours they watched?
A: When Lila watches the video at twice the normal speed, the video takes 100 / 2 = 50 hours. When she watches six such videos, the total number of video hours becomes 50 * 6 = 300 hours. Roger, her friend, watches 6 videos at the normal speed, which is 6 * 100 = 600 video hours. The total number of hours watched by the two is 600 + 300 = 900 hours. The answer is 900.
