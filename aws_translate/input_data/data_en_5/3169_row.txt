To accomplish the goal of unlocking the last story in Sonic Adventure 2, you would need to complete various tasks throughout Hero and Dark storylines. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you progress through the game and unlock the last story.

1. Choose a storyline:
Sonic Adventure 2 consists of two primary storylines: Hero and Dark. The Hero story features Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles as the playable characters, whereas the Dark story features Shadow, Dr. Eggman, and Rouge.

You can choose to play either of these storylines first, but you'll need to complete both of them eventually to unlock the last story. Completing one storyline will not directly affect the other, so feel free to switch between them as you progress.

2. Complete each stage:
As you play through the storylines, you will encounter various stages or levels that will require you to navigate through obstacles, defeat enemies, and solve puzzles. Each character will have their own unique play style and stages that cater to their abilities. For example, Sonic and Shadow stages will focus on high-speed action, while Tails and Dr. Eggman stages will involve mech-based shooting, and Knuckles and Rouge stages will require you to find hidden items.

You must complete each stage with a passing grade to move on to the next one. Keep in mind that some stages may require you to achieve specific objectives, such as defeating a boss or uncovering hidden items.

3. Collect A-rank emblems:
Throughout the game, you will receive a performance-based ranking and an emblem for each stage you complete. These ranks range from E to A, with A being the highest. Collecting A-rank emblems for all stages in both Hero and Dark storylines will not only improve your overall game score but may also unlock additional content, such as costumes and bonus content.

4. Battle key bosses:
At several points in the Hero and Dark storylines, you will need to defeat crucial bosses in order to progress. These boss battles will usually involve facing off against the counterpart from the opposing storyline, such as Sonic vs. Shadow or Tails vs. Dr. Eggman.

Be prepared for challenging battles and utilize your character's abilities to defeat these bosses effectively.

5. Complete Hero and Dark storylines:
Once you have completed all stages and defeated all bosses within the Hero and Dark storylines, you will unlock each story's individual ending. The ending of the storyline will depict a cutscene that gives context to the overarching plot and sets the stage for the last story.

6. Unlocking the last story:
Upon completing both the Hero and Dark storylines, the game will present you with a new option: the Last story. This story combines the events and characters from both storylines into a final showdown that ultimately resolves the game's story.

7. Complete the last story:
In the last story, you will play as a mix of characters from both Hero and Dark storylines. The gameplay mechanics will remain the same, but you will need to use your skills and knowledge acquired from playing through the previous stages to tackle the challenges in the last story.

Successfully completing the last story means you have conquered the entirety of Sonic Adventure 2 and unlocked every piece of the narrative. Congratulations on achieving your goal!
