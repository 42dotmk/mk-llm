Hanna!" Chris assured her, his voice filled with warmth and understanding.

The scene unfolded in the cozy, dimly-lit dining room of the Browley's home, where the scent of a delicious home-cooked meal still lingered in the air. Good friends had gathered, filling the space with laughter and conversation that made everyone feel as though they belonged.

As Hanna disappeared through the door, her face flushed and apologetic, the rest of the group continued their discussions. Mrs. Browley, a kind and experienced mother of three, reached over and patted Chris's hand. "No need to worry, dear. It's perfectly normal. I remember my pregnancies, and I had to make a run for the washroom more times than I can count."

Chris smiled weakly in response, although his concern was still evident. His eyes followed the direction in which Hanna had left, his mind racing with silent prayers for her comfort and well-being. He knew, thanks to Mrs. Browley's reassurance, that this phase of pregnancy was relatively common among expectant mothers, but he couldn't help but worry.

Mr. Browley chimed in, taking a swig from his beer before speaking. "Remember, Chris, she's a tough one. Pregnant or not, she'll get through this with flying colors. All you can do is be there for her and support her along the way."

"Yes, just as you've always been," added Mrs. Robinson, another member of the group who had been friends with Chris and Hanna since their college days.

Amy, the youngest in the room and recently engaged, listened intently to the conversation. She respected the others' opinions and cherished their advice, knowing that she would soon embark on her journey into motherhood as well. She wondered if she could handle pregnancy as gracefully as Hanna was attempting to do.

As they carried on with their conversations, passing around food and drinks, everyone maintained a small, unspoken vigilance for Hanna, attentively listening for her return. The air was filled with sincerity and support, a strong testament to the bond shared among the friends.

When Hanna finally re-emerged, her face still holding a tinge of red from embarrassment, the warm smiles and understanding glances that welcomed her back into the fold immediately put her at ease. She knew that she was in the company of people who genuinely cared about her and her family, and this thought brought her a sense of comfort.

As the evening continued, the group grew even closer, sharing stories about their experiences and offering advice or a kind word when needed. The atmosphere enveloped them in a blanket of love and trust, reminding everyone just how important these friendships were in their lives.

Afterward, when the guests had gone, and the last dish had been washed and put away, Chris found Hanna in their bedroom, lying down and resting her eyes. As he lay beside her, he whispered softly, "You did great tonight, and I am here for you always, just as our friends will be."

For Hanna, this reminder, though small, carried immense meaning. It was a reassurance that she was not alone in her journey, and no matter the challenges that may lie ahead, they would face them together, bolstered by the love and support of their friends. And with that thought warming her heart, Hanna could finally drift off to sleep, feeling deeply grateful and incredibly loved.
