Reasoning and answer: First, we determine that Isabella will be 10 * 12 = 120 months old at age 10, to find a number to compare her age to Antonio's with. Then we subtract the 18 months from the total of 120 months to find 120 - 18 = 102 months, which is the age Isabella is currently. Since at 102 months old Isabella is twice as old as Antonio, we take 102 / 2 = 51 months as Antonio's age.
The answer: 51

If he buys 2 bottles, the price drops to $20.00 per bottle so they cost 2 * 20 = $40.00. He can get 80 loads of laundry per bottle and he bought 2 bottles so that's 80 * 2 = 160 loads of laundry. The detergent cost $40.00 and he will be able to wash 160 loads of laundry so each load costs 40 / 160 = $0.25.
The answer: 25
Reverse engineering the question: Frank's laundry detergent is double concentrated and will wash 80 loads of laundry. His detergent is usually $25.00 a bottle but they're having a sale. If he buys 2 bottles, both bottles will drop to $20.00 a bottle. How much does he spend, in cents, per load of laundry, if he buys 2 bottles of detergent?

Reasoning and answer: Lou Sr 3 cookies from the jar, then another three, but then put two back, for a total of 3 + 3 - 2 = 4 cookies removed. Louie Jr took seven more out of the jar, for a total of 4 + 7 = 11 cookies removed. If Debra thought half were gone, then the number of missing cookies would equal the number of cookies that remain, or 11 missing = 11 remaining cookies.
The answer: 11

All together, Brenda and her friends make a group of 1 + 9 = 10 people. If they each want to eat 2 pizza slices, there should be 10 * 2 = 20 slices. Since a pizza has 4 slices, they will have to order 20 / 4 = 5 pizzas.
The answer: 5
Reverse engineering the question: Brenda and nine of her friends want to order a pizza. They decide that each person will eat 2 slices. If each pizza has 4 slices, how many pizzas should they order?
