New Jersey to come up with a 70% funding for the project, which he deemed unreasonable and unaffordable. However, the new proposal has Amtrak taking up a significant portion of the costs, making it more feasible and potentially alleviating the burden on New Jersey taxpayers. Senators Frank R. Lautenberg and Bob Menendez, both Democrats, are working tirelessly in bringing this project to fruition, as they believe it is essential for the continued growth and economic development of not only New Jersey but also the entire region.

There are several reasons why the Gateway Tunnel project is necessary and beneficial for both states:

1. Increased capacity: The new pair of rail tunnels would dramatically increase the rail capacity between New York and New Jersey, as they would allow more trains to pass under the Hudson River. Currently, there are only two rail tunnels that connect the two states, which severely limits the number of trains that can move between them. This has created a bottleneck situation, leading to frequent delays and congestion.

2. Enhanced transportation options: The Gateway Tunnel project would provide better commuting options for residents of both states. With the growing population and increasing demand for public transportation, the project is expected to improve the overall quality of life for those who commute between New York and New Jersey. Improved transit options would also encourage more people to rely on public transportation instead of personal vehicles, which could help alleviate traffic congestion and reduce carbon emissions. 

3. Economic growth and development: The Gateway Tunnel project is expected to create thousands of jobs during its construction phase and subsequent operation. Furthermore, it will also contribute to the overall economic growth of both states by making it easier for businesses to operate across state lines, attracting new investment, and fostering a more interconnected regional economy.

4. Aging infrastructure: The current rail tunnels connecting New York and New Jersey were built over a century ago and have suffered from years of wear and tear, as well as damage from natural disasters such as Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The Gateway Tunnel project would provide much-needed upgrades to the aging infrastructure, ensuring the safety and reliability of rail transit between the two states.

5. High-speed rail: One of the key features of the Gateway Tunnel project is the integration of high-speed rail service that could significantly reduce travel time between major east coast cities like New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. Improved intercity connections would make it easier for people to travel for work or leisure, further boosting the region's economic growth and development.

Despite the initial concerns raised by Gov. Chris Christie, the new proposal for the Gateway Tunnel project has gained traction and support due to Amtrak's willingness to share in the project's costs. This major infrastructure initiative could potentially transform the region's transportation landscape and provide much-needed upgrades to existing facilities. As a result, the Gateway Tunnel project is poised to become a vital part of the region's infrastructure, enhancing both the quality of life and economic growth for the citizens of New York and New Jersey.
