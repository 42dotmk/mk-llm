I would also like to point out that the Council adopted conclusions in June of this year, titled "Equal opportunities for women and men: active and dignified aging," aiming to facilitate the provision of quality care services in conjunction with home care for older people, taking into account the specific needs of older men and women.

In this context, the Council's conclusions highlight the importance of promoting equal opportunities for both women and men as they age and ensure active and dignified aging. This can be achieved by addressing several aspects, including the facilitation of quality care services and home care for the elderly.

Regarding the provision of quality care services, some key points can be emphasized. Firstly, it is crucial to ensure that care services are accessible, adequate, and tailored to the specific needs of older women and men. This can involve, for example, providing the necessary infrastructure, investing in the training and development of care professionals, and ensuring efficient coordination among different stakeholders, such as care providers, local authorities, and healthcare institutions.

Another important aspect is to facilitate the combination of professional and personal life for those who care for older family members, with a particular focus on promoting gender equality in care responsibilities. This can be achieved by implementing measures that support work-life balance, such as flexible working arrangements, paid leave for caregiving, and access to affordable and quality care services for their family members.

In addition to this, it is crucial to raise awareness and promote a positive image of aging and older people in society. This can help challenge ageist stereotypes and foster respect and appreciation for the contributions and experiences of older women and men. Public campaigns, educational programs, and intergenerational exchanges can be beneficial in this regard.

Furthermore, it is vital to support research and innovation in the field of aging and care services. This can help to identify and address the specific needs of older women and men, develop innovative care solutions, and improve the overall quality of care services provided to older people. Investing in technology and digitalization can also contribute to this goal, by enhancing access to care services, promoting remote monitoring and communication, and facilitating the sharing of information and best practices among care providers.

Lastly, it is important to ensure that older women and men are actively involved in decision-making processes regarding aging and care services. This can promote the development of policies and measures that are tailored to their specific needs and preferences, ultimately leading to more effective and inclusive care solutions.

In conclusion, the Council's adoption of the conclusions titled "Equal opportunities for women and men: active and dignified aging" demonstrates a commitment to addressing the needs of older people, and particularly older women and men, in the context of care services and home care. By promoting equal opportunities, quality care services, and active participation, these conclusions can contribute to a more inclusive and supportive environment for older women and men as they age.
