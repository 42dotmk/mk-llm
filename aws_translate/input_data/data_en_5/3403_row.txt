Q: Alvin is selling his marble set. He has 100 marbles. 20% are white, 30% are black, and the rest are different colors. He sells the white ones for a nickel each, the black ones for a dime each, and the colors for $0.20 each. How much does he earn?
A: He has 20 white marbles because 100 x .2 = 20. He has 30 black marbles because 100 x .3 = 30. He has 50 color marbles because 100 - 20 - 30 = 50. He earns $1 from white marbles because 20 x .05 = 1. He earns $3 from the black marbles because 30 x .1 = 3. He earns $10 from the colors because 50 x .2 = 10. He earns $14 in total because 1 + 3 + 10 = 14. The answer is 14.
Question: Coby went on a road trip. He is traveling from Washington to Nevada but he needs to stop in Idaho which is 640 miles away from Washington and 550 miles away from Nevada to pick up some friends. If Coby is traveling at a speed of 80 miles per hour going to Idaho and at a speed of 50 miles per hour from Idaho to Nevada, how many hours did it take for him to arrive at the destination?
Answer: The estimated time of arrival from Washington to Idaho is 640 / 80 = 8 hours. So, the estimated time of arrival from Idaho to Nevada is 550 / 50 = 11 hours. Therefore, It took him 11 + 8 = 19 hours to arrive at the destination. The answer is 19.
[Question]Daniel works for a sports stadium filling water bottles for athletes. He filled 254 water bottles this season. The football team had 11 players that wanted 6 bottles each. The soccer team had him fill 53 bottles. The lacrosse team needed 12 more bottles than the football team. Each team coach during the season also wanted two bottles apiece. How many bottles did he fill for the rugby team during the final game he worked this season?
[Answer]Let R be the number of water bottles Daniel refilled for the rugby team. Daniel filled 11 * 6 = 66 bottles for the football team. He filled 66 + 12 = 78 bottles for the lacrosse team. He got water bottles for four teams, so the team coaches wanted 2 * 4 = 8 bottles. In all, he filled 66 + 53 + 78 + 8 + R = R + 205 = 254 bottles in all. Thus, he filled R = 254 - 205 = 49 bottles for the rugby team this season. The answer is 49.

Question: Mickey's number is greater than Jayden's number by exactly 20. If Jayden's number is 40 less than Coraline's number, and Coraline's number is 80, calculate the total of the numbers they have.
Answer: If Coraline has the number 80, Jayden, whose number is 40 less than that of Coraline, has 80 - 40 = 40. Together, Jayden and Coraline's numbers total 80 + 40 = 120. Mickey's number is greater than Jayden's number by exactly 20, meaning his number is 40 + 20 = 60. The total of the numbers the three have is 120 + 60 = 180. The answer is 180.
