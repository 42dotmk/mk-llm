(A) Negative movie review: "The Emoji Movie" (2017)

The Emoji Movie, released in 2017 and directed by Tony Leondis, could have been an exciting adventure into the world of mobile communication that exists within our smartphones. However, rather than capitalizing on its potential to be appealing and even educational for younger audiences, the movie ends up falling short due to a weak plot, uninspired characters, and blatant product placements that amount to nothing more than a series of unrelatable "inside jokes."

The premise of the movie centers around Gene (voiced by T.J. Miller), an emoji who is designated to be "meh" but struggles to hide his technical glitch of having multiple emotions. Desperate to become "normal," he sets off on a quest to find a code that can fix his glitch with the help of his new friends Hi-5 (voiced by James Corden) and a notorious codebreaker emoji named Jailbreak (Anna Faris). Meanwhile, Gene's parents, who are also "meh" emojis, set out to find their missing son as the smartphone owner, Alex, schedules to have his phone wiped clean after various inopportune technical malfunctions.

While the concept of exploring a digital world inside a device used daily by millions of people might seem intriguing, the film's plot goes nowhere. Instead of utilizing a clever narrative to navigate this imaginative environment, The Emoji Movie relies heavily on clichéd tropes and a predictable storyline that borrows heavily from previous successful animated films with similar concepts, such as "Wreck-It Ralph" and "Inside Out."

Moreover, the characters in the movie are underdeveloped and unengaging. Gene's solely defined by his "glitch" rather than any memorable qualities, making it difficult for audiences to root for him or empathize with his struggles for self-acceptance. The supporting characters, like the overly enthusiastic Hi-5 and the tired stereotype Jailbreak (the "rebellious" female character fighting societal norms), are equally forgettable despite the film's attempts at creating a sense of camaraderie and excitement.

One of the most glaring issues with the film, however, is the blatant and excessive product placement that peppers the already dull storyline. From a prolonged scene in the app Candy Crush to a visit to the worlds of Spotify, Just Dance, and Instagram, the film misses opportunities for genuine humor and storytelling and instead reduces itself to a thinly veiled advertisement for multiple brands and popular apps. This product-driven approach detracts further from the film's potential emotional depth or connection with its audience.

The Emoji Movie's subpar graphics and animation, coupled with a lackluster voice cast led by T.J. Miller, ultimately failed to bring any level of emotion or engagement to the film, further solidifying its status as a box office flop and disappointing fans and critics alike.

In conclusion, The Emoji Movie is a glaring example of wasted potential and serves as a reminder that relying on trends, clichés, and excessive product placement will not save a poorly developed story or characters. It's a missed opportunity to create entertainment and meaningful content from a potentially fascinating concept, leaving audiences unsurprised by its negative reception and lack of box office success.
