Indeed, the primary reason why some people quit work and go back to school is to better themselves. Although various factors might contribute to this decision, the desire for self-improvement and personal growth often stands out as the central driving force. Below, we will explore several interconnected reasons to further elucidate why individuals might choose this path.

1. Career Advancement: One of the primary reasons individuals return to school is to advance their careers. Pursuing higher education often provides an opportunity to gain advanced skills and qualifications that may translate into better job opportunities, promotions, or increased earning potential. This drive for career advancement can sometimes be fueled by the realization that their current work trajectory is not fulfilling their personal or professional goals, ultimately leading them to seek further education.

2. Changing Careers: At times, some people decide to switch careers entirely, necessitating a return to school. This choice might stem from dissatisfaction with their current job, industry changes, or the realization that they would prefer to work in a different field. Gaining qualifications and relevant skills by pursuing higher education is often a crucial step in entering a new career path successfully.

3. Intellectual Curiosity and Passion for Learning: Another factor motivating people to go back to school is a desire to expand their knowledge base. Individuals may be eager to learn more about a particular topic or subject which they're genuinely interested in, driven by a passion for learning and intellectual curiosity. The pursuit of this knowledge can be seen as a means to better themselves both personally and professionally.

4. Personal Growth and Development: Some people recognize that they can benefit from personal growth and self-improvement by seeking further education. They might want to develop better communication skills, critical thinking abilities, or discipline, all of which can be honed through the pursuit of formal education. Additionally, learning new skills and acquiring knowledge can boost self-esteem and confidence, contributing positively to their quality of life.

5. Networking Opportunities: Going back to school provides individuals with the chance to meet and connect with others in their field or industry. These connections can prove valuable in terms of job prospects, collaborations, and gaining insights into the latest trends and developments within their chosen field. Networking can be a great way for people to grow both professionally and personally.

6. Responding to Changing Job Market Requirements: In an ever-evolving world, some fields demand employees to possess a higher level of education or additional skills. When faced with such changes, individuals might find it necessary to return to school to stay competitive in the job market and secure better job opportunities in the future.

From the reasons listed above, it is clear that self-improvement or "bettering themselves" is the underlying motivation for many people who choose to quit work and go back to school. This desire for growth and development, whether professionally, personally, or intellectually, facilitates their decision to invest time, energy, and resources into pursuing further education.
