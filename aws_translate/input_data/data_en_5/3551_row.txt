Q: A store gives a 10% discount for the amount of the sell that was over $1000. John buys 7 items that each cost $200. What does his order cost after the discount?
A: His order came out to 7 * 200 = $1400. So there was 1400 - 1000 = $400 that qualified for the discount. So his discount saved 400 * .1 = $40. So his purchase came out to 1400 - 40 = $1360. The answer is 1360.
Question: Rockefeller Army Base has 3000 more than twice as many guns as Grenada Army Base, 400 less than thrice as many war tractors as Grenada Army Base, and 30 times as many soldier uniforms as Grenada Army Base reserved for its national protection. How many total war supplies does Rockefeller have if Grenada's war supplies are equally divided among the 6000 war supplies they have in total?
Answer: For each component, Grenada Army Base has 6000 / 3 = 2000 each of guns, war tractors, and soldier uniforms. Rockefeller Army Base has 3000 + 2 * 2000 = 7000 guns. Rockefeller Army Base has 3 * 2000 - 400 = 5600 war tractors. Rockefeller Army Base has 30 * 2000 = 60000 soldier uniforms. The total war supplies Rockefeller Army Base has reserved are 60000 + 5600 + 7000 = 72600 war supplies for its national protection. The answer is 72600.
[Question]September's temperature fluctuated severely in 1 week. They started off with 40 degrees on Sunday then hit 50 on Monday, 65 on Tuesday, 36 on Wednesday, 82 on Thursday, 72 on Friday and ended the week at 26 on Saturday. What was the average temperature for that week?
[Answer]When you add up the temperature for the entire week, it comes to 40 + 50 + 65 + 36 + 82 + 72 + 26 = 371. These temperatures were over 7 days so the average temperature was 371 / 7 = 53 degrees. The answer is 53.
Q: How many shirts should Shenny pack for her next vacation if she's planning to use the same shirt when departing on Monday and returning on Sunday and two different shirts each other day?
A: Between Monday and Sunday there are 7 days. If she will be using the same shirt for 2 days then she will need clothes for 7 - 2 = 5 days. Because she wants to use 2 different shirts each of those 5 days then she needs 2 * 5 = 10 shirts. In total she will need 10 shirts between Tuesday and Saturday and 1 shirt for Monday and Sunday = 11 shirts. The answer is 11.
Question: The space station, Lupus-1, is an enormous spacecraft made up of three identical cylindrical structures that house the living quarters for the crew.  The three cylindrical structures are linked together by a series of tunnels that hold them together and allow the crew to move between cylinders. Each cylindrical structure contains 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and several kitchens. If the entire space station has 72 rooms, how many kitchens are there on the entire space station?
Answer: If there are 3 identical cylindrical structures, with a combined total of 72 rooms, then each individual cylindrical structure contains 72 / 3 = 24 rooms. In each 24 - room cylindrical structure, there are 24 - 12 - 7 = 5 kitchens. Thus, the entire, three - cylinder space station contains a total of 3 * 5 = 15 kitchens. The answer is 15.
