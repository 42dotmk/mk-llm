Title: The Forgotten Royal Soldiers: A Tale of Two Princes during World War I

In the remarkable collection of letters that have recently come to light, and which are now being sold at auction in Guernsey for £45,000, we learn the fascinating story of two royal brothers during World War I – Edward VIII and his younger brother, who would eventually become King George VI. These letters shed new light on the predicament faced by the young princes during the great conflict of the early 20th century.

Despite being the direct heir to the throne, Edward VIII, later known as the Duke of Windsor, was banned from active military service during the war, much to his despair. His younger brother, the future King George VI, was also unable to participate in the conflict due to health issues. Both princes, feeling neglected and left out of the great struggle of their time, took pen to paper and wrote to their military mentor to express their frustrations and the impact of the war on their personal and public lives.

While many may assume that their royal status protected them from the horrors faced by ordinary soldiers during the war, these letters reveal the emotional turmoil these young men experienced when they found themselves unable to serve their country in such dire times. Edward VIII boldly admitted his envy for the soldiers fighting in the trenches and lamented the fact that he was left "totally devoid of any job" during the war. There was a deep feeling of frustration and guilt that haunted the prince as he struggled to come to terms with his lack of contribution to the war effort.

For his younger brother, George VI, the constraints were physical. Suffering from chronic gastric problems, he was banned from serving by royal doctors who feared for his well-being. This, too, caused its own unique problems, with the prince worrying that the public would criticize him for not being on the front line and fighting alongside his fellow citizens. This fear of public backlash remained a constant source of stress for the prince, who felt both impotent and guilty for his inability to contribute directly to the war effort.

But the royal brothers' contributions during the Great War cannot be overlooked. Although denied the opportunity to fight on the front lines, they played crucial roles in supporting the troops and the wider war effort back home. Edward VIII took up various administrative posts and public engagements, while George VI worked to overcome his stutter and became an important figure in bolstering morale both at home and abroad. Their commitment to their country and to the welfare of its citizens was palpable, despite the personal challenges they faced.

It is important to recognize that the lives of the royal family, especially during times of war, are not as privileged and shielded as one might assume. They too faced pressure and anxiety as a result of their inability to participate in the conflict. These letters reveal the burden of responsibility that weighed on the royal brothers during World War I, a period that dramatically shaped their lives and the course of British history. The auctioning of these letters provides a fascinating insight into the turmoil, the loneliness and the frustrations of the future kings who felt left out in the midst of a war that consumed their nation.
