Shulman also wrote a feature film adaptation of his "Dobie Gillis" stories for MGM in 1953, entitled "The Affairs of Dobie Gillis".  - William Joseph Schallert (July 6, 1922  May 8, 2016) was an American character actor who appeared in many films and in such television series as "; "Perry Mason; The Smurfs"; "Jefferson Drum"; "Philip Marlowe"; "The Rat Patrol"; "Gunsmoke"; ""; "The Patty Duke Show"; "87th Precinct"; "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis"; " The Waltons"; "Hawaii Five-O", "Quincy, M.E."; "The Partridge Family"; "Bonanza"; ""; "Leave It to Beaver"; "The Dick Van Dyke Show"; "Love, American Style"; "Get Smart"; "Lawman"; "Combat!"; "The Wild Wild West"; and in later years, "", "Medium", "My Name is Earl", and "True Blood".  - Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel "The Time Machine", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction.  - Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s "Islands of Space" in "Astounding Science Fiction". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the "hard" (natural) and "soft" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful.  - Eric Braeden (born Hans-Jörg Gudegast; April 3, 1941) is a German film and television actor, known for his roles as Victor Newman on the soap opera "The Young and the Restless", as Hans Dietrich in the 1960s TV series "The Rat Patrol", Dr. Charles Forbin in "", and as John Jacob Astor IV in the 1997 film "Titanic". He won a Daytime Emmy Award in 1998 for Lead Actor in a Drama Series for the role of Victor Newman.  - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant "speculative literature".  - The Patty Duke Show is an American sitcom that ran on ABC from September 18, 1963 to April 27, 1966, with reruns airing through August 31.
