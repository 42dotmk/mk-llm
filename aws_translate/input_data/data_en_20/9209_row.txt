 WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican Kevin McCarthy easily won an internal party election Wednesday to take over the shrunken House GOP caucus, a familiar role for the underestimated scrapper whose top priority will be to protect President Donald Trump's agenda and try to build the party back to retake the majority. 
  
 The speaker's gavel long gone, the race for minority leader was McCarthy's to lose, but the Californian's rise was never guaranteed. He's close to Trump, but the president is also friendly with Rep. Jim Jordan, the conservative Freedom Caucus member, and both faced testy colleagues ready to assign blame after the midterm election losses. 
  
 In the end, McCarthy pushed past Jordan, 159-43, according to officials familiar with the closed-door voting. 
  
 McCarthy "knows what he needs to do," said GOP Whip Steve Scalise, the Louisiana Republican who was gravely wounded in last year's congressional baseball practice shooting and unanimously won the No. 2 spot as minority whip. 
  
 "You always look in the mirror and see what you can do better," Scalise said Tuesday. Republicans, he said, "need to do a better job of letting people know what we stand for." 
  
 Theirs was the marquee contest as senators also chose new leaders, but House Democrats put off until after Thanksgiving the biggest contest, Rep. Nancy Pelosi's bid to return as her party's nominee for speaker. 
  
 On the other side of the Capitol, senators chose Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for another term leading Republicans and Chuck Schumer for Democrats in closed-door party elections that lacked the drama of the House contest. 
  
 Both McConnell and Schumer were chosen as leader by acclamation, according to those familiar with the private caucus meetings. McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who expanded GOP ranks in last week's midterm, faced no opponent. Democrats returned Schumer's entire leadership team, despite the failure to capture the majority in the midterms. 
  
 Senate Republicans also welcomed the first woman to their leadership team in years, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, as they sought to address the optics of the GOP side of the aisle being dominated by men. 
  
 Ernst called her selection to the leadership ranks "a great honor." 
  
 During a brief photo op in McConnell's Capitol office ahead of voting, McConnell presented his newly elected senators who will take their seats in January. 
  
 Among them was Florida's Rick Scott, the Republican governor whose race against incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson remains undecided. McConnell said later he was confident Scott would become the 53rd senator in the GOP majority. 
  
 Schumer said Trump is lying about voter fraud in Florida's election and remained confident Nelson would return as Florida's senator, as long as every vote was counted. 
  
 "President Trump and Gov. Scott have just lied," Schumer said. "They've said there's fraud when their own Republican officials in Florida have said there's no fraud." 
  
 Schumer portrayed Senate Democrats as emboldened, despite midterm losses, by an election he characterized as a rejection of the GOP tax cuts and Republican efforts to end the Affordable Care Act. 
  
 Even in the minority, Schumer said Senate Democrats will push for the party's broader congressional agenda of lowering health care costs, investing in infrastructure and implementing good government reforms to put a check on the Trump administration, which he called "the most ethically challenged in history." 
  
 "We will be relentless here in the Senate," said Schumer, flanked by his leadership team. "Senate Democrats are committed to fighting to make those ideas a reality in this upcoming Congress." 
  
 Trump has stayed largely on the sidelines ahead of elections that will determine party leadership. 
  
 The contest between McCarthy and Jordan reflected the split between the GOP's conservative flank, whose numbers are bolstered after the election, and what remains of the centrists. It will continue to challenge the new leader. 
  
 Jordan's entire campaign was built on the premise, lawmakers said, that Republicans lost because they didn't "do what we said" — including on Trump's priorities to build the border wall with Mexico. 
  
 On Wednesday, Jordan told "Fox & Friends" the GOP lost its House majority because it didn't deliver on promises to Americans to secure the U.S.-Mexico border, fund Trump's wall and replace the Obama health care law. 
  
 "Some key things we told them we were going to do, we didn't," Jordan said. 
  
 The Ohio Republican, though, was always considered a longshot, and his run was viewed as a way to assert a greater role for the conservatives and the Freedom Caucus at the leadership table. 
  
 Conservatives have long promoted Jordan for the ranking member position on a top House committee, including the Judiciary panel, where Democrats plan multiple investigations into Trump's businesses and administration. 
  
 Most GOP lawmakers, though, preferred McCarthy's more affable approach to running the often unruly conference. 
  
 Rounding out the GOP leadership team will be Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, who wants to bring a more aggressive stance to the GOP's communications and messaging strategy in the No. 3 spot. 
  
 In the lead-up to Wednesday's election, McCarthy and Jordan encountered frustration, finger-pointing and questions as lawmakers sorted through an election defeat and began considering new leadership for the next congressional session. 
  
 Republicans complained about the unpopularity of the GOP tax law they blamed for losses in New York and other key states, some attendees told reporters after the meeting. Some in the meeting said Republicans should have tried harder to fulfill Trump's priorities, like funding for the wall with Mexico. They also warned that they need a new fundraising mechanism to compete with the small-dollar online donors that powered Democrats to victory. 
  
 "There's a little rawness still," Rep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., who is running unopposed for a down-ballot position as vice chair of the GOP conference, told reporters outside the meeting room. "But there's an opportunity for us to come together and get single-focused on the message." 
  
 On the Democratic side, Pelosi remains she's confident she'll have enough support to win when voting gets underway after Thanksgiving, and challenged her opponents Wednesday to put forward an alternative candidate. 
  
 "Come on in, the water's warm," Pelosi said.

 ___ ||||| Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has vowed to help lead Republicans back to the majority in 2020. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO Congress McCarthy hits hard at Dems after winning minority leader post The California Republican easily defeated conservative hard-liner Jim Jordan. 
  
 House Republicans immediately resumed a wartime posture Wednesday after electing their new leadership — vowing to aggressively resist Democrats' agenda and work to recapture the House majority after being routed in last week's elections. 
  
 In his first news conference after Republicans chose him to be House minority leader next year, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) largely attributed the GOP wipeout to historical trends while also repeatedly blaming spending by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg as the cause of several Republican defeats in close contests. 
  
 Story Continued Below 
  
 And rather than offer any conciliatory words to Democratic leaders, McCarthy and his newly appointed leadership team said they intend to retake the House in 2020 and push back against a Democratic agenda they described as primarily aimed at unseating President Donald Trump. 
  
 "I know they want to abolish ICE. I know they want to impeach the president," McCarthy said. "I just don’t think that’s the agenda Americans want." 
  
 McCarthy's comments came shortly after his colleagues and incoming GOP freshmen elected him to be the top House Republican in next year's Congress, easily casting aside a challenge for the post from conservative firebrand Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).

 McCarthy got 159 votes to Jordan’s 43 in the members-only session, according to Republican sources in the room. 
  
 The victory sealed McCarthy's yearslong drive to rise to the top of the House Republican Conference, an effort derailed by Jordan and the conservative House Freedom Caucus in 2015. Back then, McCarthy was running for speaker but ran into opposition from the Freedom Caucus and withdrew his name from consideration. That cleared the way for Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to become speaker. 
  
 Ryan announced in April he would retire from the House; amid intense jockeying behind the scenes to replace him, McCarthy consistently remained the front-runner. 
  
 House Republicans also filled out the rest of their leadership team for the new Congress with few surprises. 
  
 Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana will be minority whip, and Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming — a rising star in the party and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney — will be Republican Conference chairwoman. Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina will be vice chair and Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota will chair the National Republican Campaign Committee. Rep. Gary Palmer of Alabama will lead the Republican Policy Committee. Palmer is the first member of the Freedom Caucus to capture a leadership role. 
  
 Following McCarthy's comments, Cheney gave a nod to the GOP's struggles among women and minorities. She insisted that Republicans would "take a back seat to no one" when it comes to "doing what's right for America's women, America's minorities." 
  
 McCarthy also acknowledged Republicans' struggles in the suburbs. 
  
 "We took a beating inside the suburban areas," he said, adding, "Our ideas are going to have to be stronger." 
  
 McCarthy’s victory is a bittersweet one, coming as Republicans prepare to hand the speaker's gavel back to Democrats for the first time in eight years. 
  
 Dragged down by history and Trump’s dismal poll numbers, Democrats enjoyed their biggest House victory since the Watergate scandal of the 1970s. Democrats are on track to gain 35 to 40 seats, including a slew in McCarthy’s home state of California, where an already small number of Republican House members saw their ranks shrink dramatically. 
  
 McCarthy didn't mention Trump in his remarks after the leadership elections, instead alluding to him only when asked about the reason for GOP losses. He criticized Democrats for what he said seemed to be a plan to impeach the president, though Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has rebuffed the notion. He also sidestepped a question about whether Trump's unpopularity and divisive rhetoric hurt Republicans in the elections — saying only that presidents nearly always see their party lose seats in the midterms. 
  
 In McCarthy's pitch to the GOP Conference, multiple members said the Californian touted his role in recapturing the House from Democrats back in 2010 — a feat Republicans are now solely focused on repeating. 
  
 “I think the consensus was, he could unify us. He helped us win back the majority from Nancy Pelosi once, and we believe he can do it again,” Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) told reporters. 
  
 Multiple GOP veterans left Wednesday’s meeting visibly energized and ready to spar with Democratic leaders. 
  
 “We know the Democrats’ base is going to be pushing them toward investigations and impeachments ad nauseam, probably Cabinet officials, maybe a Supreme Court justice, certainly a president,” said Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), a longtime lawmaker who helped lead the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998. “When they overreach, which I’m sure they will, then I think we should push back and we should push back aggressively,” added Chabot, who is running for the top GOP spot on the House Judiciary Committee. 
  
 McCarthy was nominated for the post by House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry, (R-Texas); Reps. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Brian Mast (R-Fla.) also spoke in favor. 
  
 The California Republican will still have to deal with Jordan, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and other House conservatives who have made headaches for GOP leaders over the years. 
  
 POLITICO reported Tuesday night that Trump urged McCarthy to “make everybody happy” in regard to Jordan, who wants to be ranking member on the Judiciary Committee. However, Jordan is not popular with other House Republicans and may not be able to jump over more senior lawmakers for the Judiciary post. 
  
 In his remarks, McCarthy thanked Jordan for running against him but gave little indication of what he expects Jordan's role to be in the next Congress. 
  
 Meadows told reporters that he thinks Jordan has earned a look to lead Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, a role that would make him Trump's most prominent defender in any impeachment probe. 
  
 Jordan left the vote without speaking to reporters, but Meadows said Jordan was "gratified" to receive the 43 votes he got. He also said McCarthy would be a "good leader" and would "do his best to bring everybody together." 
  
 Asked whether Jordan should be elevated to the top GOP slot on the Judiciary Committee, Meadows added, "I think Jim’s earned the position for ranking member on Judiciary. But that’s not my call." 
  
 Other Jordan allies on the House Freedom Caucus signaled that they had made peace with McCarthy’s victory, particularly after one of their own won a spot on the GOP leadership team. 
  
 “In terms of right now, I think we made the right choice in Kevin,” Palmer told reporters. “When we get the majority back, [Jordan will] chair, and he will be a force to be reckoned with.”
