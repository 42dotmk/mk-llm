Drugs and weapons charges take precedence over Los Angeles killing in move that could give Durst’s lawyers time to fight basis of his arrest on murder charges 
  
 Robert Durst’s extradition to California to face first-degree murder charges will be postponed at least until next week because authorities in New Orleans, where he was arrested on Saturday, want to pursue their own lesser charges against him first. 
  
  
  
 Orleans Parish magistrate Harry Cantrell on Tuesday set a bail hearing for next Monday regarding an illegal weapons charge – Durst had a revolver on him when he was detained in the lobby of a Marriott hotel – and a second count of marijuana possession.

 Those charges pale in comparison to the killing of Durst’s friend Susan Berman, who was gunned down in her home in Los Angeles two days before Christmas in 2000. Berman’s is one of three mysterious deaths that Durst, the one-time heir to a New York real estate fortune, has been close to over the past 33 years. Durst was officially charged on Monday with her murder. 
  
  
  
 It was not immediately clear why New Orleans wanted to pursue its own case against Durst, but the unexpected hold-up offered an opening for Durst’s team of attorneys. 
  
 They have already been on warpath over The Jinx, the documentary series that appears to have played a significant role – disputed by the LAPD – in breaking open the dormant investigation into Berman’s killing and featured a possible confession from Durst in its concluding episode, which aired on Sunday. 
  
 Durst’s lead attorney, Dick DeGuerin, told reporters on the courthouse steps in New Orleans that he would take advantage of the delay in extradition proceedings to fight the basis of Durst’s arrest even before he leaves Louisiana. 
  
 “My concern is that the warrant that was issued in California was issued because of a television show and not because of facts,” DeGuerin said. “We’re going to get to contest that warrant here in Louisiana because of the Louisiana authorities’ determining to file charges here.” 
  
 While legal experts said it was extremely unlikely that Durst could see the charges dropped before being extradited – an extradition his lawyers have already said he will not contest – DeGuerin seemed to relish the opportunity to give his defence strategy a dress rehearsal and accuse his adversaries of letting a television programme dictate what 15 years of inconclusive police investigation could not. 
  
 “His arrest,” DeGuerin said, “is not based on facts. It’s based on ratings.” 
  
 The Los Angeles police department has already hit back against the notion that the arrest was timed to coincide with the airing of the documentary. Their version of events is that they have built a case against Durst based on months of renewed investigation. “We didn’t base anything we did on the HBO series,” the LAPD deputy chief Kirk Albanese told the Los Angeles Times. “The arrest was made as a result of the investigative efforts and at a time that we believe it was needed.” 
  
 The producers of The Jinx have denied they had any deal with law enforcement or that they knew when Durst’s arrest was coming. Nobody has produced evidence to the contrary. 
  
 Questions have been raised, however, over the timeline of events as presented in the last episode of The Jinx. 
  
 In a dramatic final interview for the show, Durst was presented with an envelope he had addressed to Susan Berman which bore many similarities to an anonymous note mailed to the Beverly Hills police on the day of Berman’s murder. Durst at first acknowledged the similarity but denied being the killer. 
  
 He then went to the bathroom with his microphone still switched on, and in a conversation to himself appeared to suggest the jig was up. “What a disaster,” he said. “What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.” 
  
 Andrew Jarecki, the director of the documentary, has already faced questions about how long he waited before handing over the envelope and the audio recording in the bathroom to police. He acknowledged in an interview with CBS – one of his only interviews since the finale aired – that there was a delay of several months but said that was because it took that long for his team to stumble on the bathroom audio for themselves. 
  
 Now there appears to be a separate problem of presentation in the documentary itself. The final episode strongly suggested the interview occurred in the autumn of 2013 and that Durst, having resisted being reinterviewed, finally consented because he needed the film-makers’ help in a legal spat with his brother. But the New York Times has reported for two days now that according to its sources the interview occurred as long as 18 months previously. 
  
 This is the kind of inconsistency that, if proven correct, defence lawyers feast on. It is already doubtful whether Durst’s bathroom ramblings constitute a confession that can stand up in court – one law professor, Laurie Levenson of Loyola Law School Los Angeles, said it was not a confession but a “reckless statement”. If DeGuerin can show there are other problems with it, he may seek to undermine its reliability further. 
  
 Jarecki and his producing partner, Marc Smerling, ducked the timeline question in an interview with the New York Times published on Monday and then cancelled a slew of other interviews. They put out a statement saying it was no longer appropriate to speak to the media because they could be called as witnesses if Durst goes to trial for the murder of Susan Berman. 
  
  
  
 HBO, meanwhile, would not answer questions from the Guardian about when they did a deal with Jarecki and Smerling and when it was decided to do the documentary in six parts – questions that might clarify when the film-makers knew how good their material was going to be. HBO said only that “we believe the relevant information was turned over to the authorities in a timely and responsible manner”. 
  
  ||||| AP Karen Mitchell of Eureka, Calif., was last seen Nov. 25, 1997. Robert Durst may be connected to her disappearance, police said. Enlarge FBI 18-year-old Kristen Modafferi disappeared after leaving work in San Francisco on June 23, 1997. Robert Durst was said to be living in the area at the time. Enlarge 
  
 Two teenage girls who went missing in California 18 years ago could come back to haunt Robert Durst. 
  
 Detectives searching for Karen Mitchell and Kristen Modafferi took a look at the mysterious Manhattan real estate scion back in 2003 when he was on trial in Galveston, Tex., for murdering and dismembering his neighbor. 
  
 Now that Durst will soon be heading back to Los Angeles to face a charge of murdering old friend Susan Berman in 2000, the search for 16-year-old Mitchell is back on the front burner, said an author who has covered Durst for years. 
  
 “Karen Mitchell's family spoke with the FBI as recently as a few months ago,” said Matt Birkbeck, who wrote "A Deadly Secret: The Strange Disappearance of Kathie Durst." “They brought up Durst.” 
  
 Kathie Durst was the cross-dressing multimillionaire’s first wife, who vanished in 1982. 
  
 Humboldt County District Attorney Maggie Fleming declined to discuss Durst or the Mitchell case. 
  
 “I really can't confirm or deny that Durst is a person of interest because anything said about the investigation could potentially hinder the investigation,” she said. 
  
 Gerald Herbert/AP Robert Durst is escorted into Orleans Parish Prison after his arraignment in Orleans Parish Criminal District Court in New Orleans on Tuesday. 
  
 Modafferi’s dad said he hasn’t heard from the feds recently about his daughter, who was 18 when she vanished while visiting San Francisco. So he is reaching out to them. 
  
 “The Durst news has created enough of a question mark in my mind that I'm going to follow up with the FBI,” Bob Modafferi said. “If he was in that area where Kirsten went missing, it raises a bunch of potential red flags and questions.” 
  
 Mitchell, who vanished on Nov. 25, 1997, volunteered at a homeless shelter in Eureka, Calif., where Durst had been spotted, Birkbeck said. 
  
 Police said that after leaving the shelter, Mitchell walked over to the Bayshore Mall and visited her aunt, Annie Casper, at her shoe store. 
  
 Then Mitchell left for her aunt’s home — and has not been seen since. 
  
 Durst lived in the nearby town of Trinidad at the time and visited Casper’s store — while dressed in drag — at least four times, Birkbeck said. 
  
 Investigators also looked at Durst in connection with Modafferi, a college student from North Carolina who went missing on June 23, 1997, Birkbeck said. 
  
 “The investigators told me that one of the suspects they were looking at had dressed in drag, he had some odd habits,” he said, referring to the Mitchell case. “After I finished the interview, I mentioned that I covered Robert Durst, who also dressed in drag. They wrote his name down and then I discovered he was living in San Francisco at the time. The police just jumped on it. They started putting pieces together.” 
  
 Bob Modafferi, 66, of Charlotte, N.C. confirmed that cops went “down that road to see if there was anything to it.” 
  
 “They did not indicate to us there’s anything there,” he said. “As time goes on, realistically the hope starts to dim, but it never dies out completely. There are cases you hear about that finally have a break. We will never lose faith or give up hope.” 
  
 Durst’s lawyers have said they know nothing about Mitchell or Modafferi and deny he had anything to do with Berman’s murder or Kathie Durst’s disappearance. 
  
 Durst was acquitted of killing neighbor Morris Black, even though he admitted chopping up his body.

 Durst, 71, is charged with murder in a killing in California 15 years ago, and has been suspected — but never charged — in the disappearance of his first wife in New York. In 2003, he was acquitted of murder in a dismemberment death in Texas. His arrest in New Orleans came shortly before the finale of an HBO series about his links to the three killings. 
  
 Seven officers spent hours Tuesday searching Durst's home in a 17-story condominium building in a posh Houston neighborhood. About 8:30 p.m. the officers, including one wearing a Los Angeles Police Department badge, carried two white cardboard document boxes to six vehicles and left. 
  
 The officers declined to comment, except for one who confirmed they were done. 
  
 FBI spokeswoman Shauna Dunlap confirmed that FBI agents participated in the operation at the request of the Los Angeles Police Department. Harris County district attorney's office spokesman Jeff McShan said the Los Angeles Police Department contacted his office last week. 
  
 Neither Dunlap nor McShan would elaborate on what was happening inside the building and referred questions to Los Angeles police. 
  
 LAPD spokesman Sgt. Barry Montgomery said the department is not commenting until Durst is in its custody. Durst is being held in Louisiana, where he faces drug and weapons charges, and it's not clear how soon he will be returned to California. 
  
 "This is an investigation that's being handled by multi-jurisdictions," Montgomery said. "At this juncture the only thing the LAPD is doing is waiting for the extradition. We are just waiting on him to make it into our custody." 
  
 Durst, 71, was charged Monday in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the shooting of Susan Berman, his confidante and the daughter of a prominent Las Vegas mobster, in Beverly Hills. He could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime. 
  
 Dick DeGuerin, Durst's longtime Houston defense attorney, said he was baffled by what investigators could be looking for in the condo building. 
  
 "I think it's a publicity stunt. I'm not surprised by it, but I would really be surprised if they found anything of any evidentiary value," he said. 
  
 In the documentary "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst" that just wrapped up, Durst mumbled about how he "killed them all," providing a dramatic kick to the end of the series. But a law enforcement official said his arrest on the murder charge was based on words he wrote. 
  
 Analysis linked a letter Durst wrote to Berman a year before her killing with one that pointed police to her body, and that was the key new evidence in the long-dormant investigation into the 2000 killing, the official not authorized to speak publicly told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing. 
  
 Bob Martin, who has lived with his wife, Carol, in the Houston building for 1 ½ years, said he would occasionally say hello to Durst and discuss the real estate market with him. He described Durst as no quirkier than anyone else in the building. He added that Durst would occasionally attend the building's homeowners' association meetings and that the building staff reported Durst was courteous to them, as well. 
  
 Durst waived extradition in New Orleans, but authorities there charged him with being a felon in possession of a gun and with having marijuana. Assistant District Mark Burton said investigators found more than a quarter-pound of pot and a revolver in his hotel room. 
  
 DeGuerin said he wants a hearing in Louisiana as soon as possible to contest the arrest. 
  
 "The warrant we believe is based on a television show and not on actual fact," he said. "We want a hearing as quickly as possible so Mr. Durst can go to California and face trial as quickly as possible." 
  
 The judge in New Orleans scheduled another hearing for next Monday.

 A California police department is interested in speaking with the law enforcement agencies that have investigated New York real-estate heir Robert Durst in connection with a teenage girl who went missing in the late 90s, police told NBC News on Tuesday. 
  
 Eureka Police Department Chief Andy Mills said Tuesday that he would like to talk to investigators who have dug into Durst’s past in connection with the disappearance of Karen Mitchell, who was 16 when she went missing from Eureka, California, in 1997. 
  
 "We believe she met foul play but we do not know that for sure," Mills told NBC News, adding that they would like to learn more about when Durst was in Eureka. 
  
 But Mills was clear to point out that the department has not made any sort of definitive, direct link between the Mitchell case and Durst. 
  
 “I caution people about reaching too far too quickly,�? he said. 
  
 Durst was charged Monday in Los Angeles with the 2000 murder of his close friend Susan Berman, who investigators say may have been a witness to an earlier crime. 
  
 Police on Tuesday searched the Houston home of the millionaire, leaving Durst's home in a 17-story condominium building at about 8:30 p.m. and carrying two white cardboard document boxes, The Associated Press reported. One of the officers was wearing a Los Angeles Police Department badge. They declined to comment to the AP. 
  
 Harris County district attorney's office spokesman Jeff McShan told the AP he was contacted by the Los Angeles Police Department last week, but he wouldn’t elaborate further. 
  
 Durst was also questioned in the 1982 disappearance of his wife, Kathleen, and admitted to shooting and dismembering a neighbor in 2001, but was acquitted on a self-defense claim. 
  
 Durst was caught on a microphone while filming the HBO documentary "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst" saying: "What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course." The bombshell sound bite aired during the finale of the documentary Sunday. 
  
 Durst's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, told reporters after a court hearing Tuesday that he was worried "that the warrant that was issued in California was issued because of a television show and not because of facts." 
  
 "Bob Durst did not kill Susan Berman. He doesn't know who did," DeGuerin said. 
  
 Los Angeles Deputy Police Chief Kirk Albanese said the timing of the arrest had nothing to do with the HBO show and that investigators were concerned that Durst might flee the country. 
  
 "We do police work based on the facts and evidence," Albanese told the Associated Press on Monday. "I know there's lots of speculation about that. It had nothing to do with the show."
