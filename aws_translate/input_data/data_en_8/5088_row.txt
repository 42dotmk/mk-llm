Step 1: Establish the settings and characters

In order to build a movie plot, we need to first establish the main characters, their backgrounds, and the setting in which the story is taking place. 

- Main Characters: Jacob (a smooth-talking, experienced womanizer) and Cal (a shy, inexperienced man when it comes to dating).
- Setting: A modern urban city, a popular nightclub, and various other venues where people socialize.

Step 2: Introduce conflict or problem

The story begins with Cal going through a tough breakup with his long-time girlfriend. In the process, he discovers that he's never really learned how to "pick up women" or navigate the dating world. This is the main driving force behind the story, and Cal's problem that needs to be resolved.

Step 3: Introduce mentor figure

One night, at a popular nightclub, Cal observes Jacob successfully wooing a beautiful woman. Impressed and intrigued, Cal decides to approach Jacob and asks him for help in learning his techniques. Jacob agrees, and thus begins their mentor-student relationship.

Step 4: Formulate the lessons and challenges

Throughout the story, Jacob teaches Cal various techniques and strategies for picking up women, which include:
- Building self-confidence
- Improving appearance and style
- Mastering effective communication and flirting skills
- Delivering compliments and making meaningful connections

Each lesson is accompanied by various challenges and awkward situations, where Cal struggles to put these new techniques into practice but gradually improves as he gains more experience.

Step 5: Introduce secondary characters and subplots

As the story unfolds, we also meet secondary characters who contribute to the storyline. These characters might include:

- Female love interests who Cal pursues
- Cal's ex-girlfriend, who eventually tries to win him back
- Friends and doubters who discourage Cal's new pursuits
- Some of Jacob's past relationships or "conquests"

Step 6: Reach a turning point

As Cal starts to become more successful in picking up women, he begins to question whether there's more to relationships than simply picking up women. He starts to feel unsatisfied and empty after short flings, and begins to wonder what it means to find a meaningful connection. This may be sparked by a particular encounter, like meeting a woman who challenges his newfound ways or shows him the importance of meaningful relationships.

Step 7: Climax and resolution

At the climax of the story, Cal has to make a choice. He may be confronted with the decision of whether to pursue a meaningful relationship with a particular woman or maintain his new lifestyle as a womanizer with Jacob. Ultimately, Cal decides to use what he has learned to establish a meaningful and long-lasting relationship, realizing that there's more to life than superficial connections. This represents Cal's character growth and the resolution of his initial problem.

Step 8: Ending

The movie ends with Cal being happy and content in a meaningful relationship, having learned valuable lessons from Jacob. At the same time, Jacob starts to question his own lifestyle choices and may even begin to seek a more meaningful connection as well. This leaves the possibility for further character development and potential sequels.

Thus, the movie plot revolves around Cal's journey in learning how to pick up women, his personal growth, and realization of the importance of meaningful relationships.
