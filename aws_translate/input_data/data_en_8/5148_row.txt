Under Lamoriello's stewardship, the Devils made the playoffs all but three times between 1988 and 2012, including 13 berths in a row from 1997 to 2010, and finished with a winning record every season from 1992 -- 93 to 2009 -- 10. They have won the Atlantic Division regular season title nine times, most recently in 2009 -- 10, before transferring to the newly created Metropolitan Division as part of the NHL's realignment in 2013.
