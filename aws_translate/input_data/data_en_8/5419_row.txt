Question: Marge had a winning lottery ticket for $12006 and wanted to spend some of it wisely before using on any fun things. She paid half of the lottery amount for the taxes on her winnings, then put a third of the leftover money towards her student loans. She put $1000 in savings and invested a fifth of that amount in the stock market. How many dollars does she have left for fun?
Answer: Marge used half the $12006 for taxes, so she had 12006 / 2 = $6003 left. She used 1 / 3 of the leftover money on student loans, so she paid 6003 / 3 = $2001. After paying the student loans, she had 6003 - 2001 = $4002 left. She put $1000 in savings, so she had 4002 - 1000 = $3002 left. She invested 1000 / 5 = $200 in the stock market. After investing, she had 3002 - 200 = $2802 left for fun. The answer is 2802.
[Question]Johann had 60 oranges. He decided to eat 10. Once he ate them, half were stolen by Carson. Carson returned exactly 5. How many oranges does Johann have now?
[Answer]Start with the consumed oranges: 60 oranges - 10 oranges = 50 oranges. To find the stolen oranges: 50 oranges / 2 = 25 oranges. To find the number of oranges after the return: 25 oranges + 5 oranges = 30 oranges. The answer is 30.
Q: Martha is knitting winter clothes for her 3 grandchildren, who are all the same size (identical triplets.) Each set of clothes consists of a woolen hat, a scarf, a sweater, a pair of mittens, and a pair of wooly socks. She can knit a hat in 2 hours. A scarf takes her 3 hours. Each mitten takes her about an hour to knit. A sock takes an hour and a half. Each sweater takes her 6 hours. How long will it take her to knit all the outfits?
A: A pair of mittens takes 1 hour per mitten * 2 mittens = 2 hours. A pair of socks takes 1.5 hours per sock * 2 socks = 3 hours. So a complete outfit for each child takes 2 hours per hat + 3 hours per scarf + 2 hours per pair of mittens + 3 hours per pair of socks + 6 hours per sweater = 16 hours per outfit. So to knit winter outfits for all three of her grandchildren, Martha will take 3 outfits * 16 hours per outfit = 48 hours. The answer is 48.
Question: The population of Mojave was 4000 a decade ago. If the town's population has increased three times, and the population analysis firm predicts that it will increase by 40% after five years, how many people will be in Mojave in five years?
Answer: Since the population of Mojave has increased three times the number it was a decade ago, there are 3 * 4000 = 12000 people in Mojave now. It's predicted that the population will increase by 40 / 100 * 12000 = 4800 people after five years. This means there will be 12000 + 4800 = 16800 people living in Mojave in five years. The answer is 16800.
[Question]The pizza delivery person has 12 pizzas to deliver. If two of the stops are for orders of two pizzas and the rest are for single pizzas, how many minutes per stop does the delivery person need to average to deliver all of the pizzas in 40 minutes?
[Answer]If two pizzas will be delivered at two of the stops, the total number of stops will be 12 - 2 = 10 stops. If there are 10 stops in 40 minutes, then the delivery person needs to average 40 / 10 = 4 minutes per stop. The answer is 4.
