Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- With Kim Jong Un out of sight for a month, three North Korean officials popped down to South Korea for a last-minute visit Saturday. And they delivered a diplomatic bonbon. The three officials told South Korea that Pyongyang is willing to hold a new round of high-level meetings between late October and early November, South Korea's Unification Ministry said in a statement Saturday. "Within my memory...there was never ever such a high-level visit. Never," said North Korea analyst Andrei Lankov, from Seoul's Kookmin University. Lankov said two of the three visitors "are essentially number two and number three in North Korean official hierarchy."

The visit and offer for high-level dialogue come as a surprise for many who believed that the tensions between the two countries would further escalate, particularly due to Kim Jong Un's absence. The three high-ranking North Korean officials, Choe Ryong Hae, Kim Yang Gon, and Hwang Pyong So, met with South Korea's National Security Adviser, Kim Kwan-jin, and Unification Minister, Ryoo Kihl-jae, expressing their intentions for resuming inter-Korean talks.

In response to the North's offer for high-level meetings, South Korea has cautiously welcomed the proposal and urged Pyongyang to commit to denuclearization before engaging in further talks. "We have consistently maintained that the door for dialogue and communications is openâ€¦ However, the North should show its sincerity in pursuing denuclearization through concrete actions," said South Korean Unification Ministry spokesperson, Lim Byeong Cheol.

As the proposed meetings would mark a major shift in diplomatic relations between the two Koreas, regional and global powers are closely monitoring the situation. The United States, which has been involved in previous Six-Party Talks aimed at North Korea's denuclearization, has expressed support for the inter-Korean dialogue while emphasizing the importance of North Korea taking denuclearization seriously.

In the meantime, the unprecedented visit has stirred speculations about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's health and whereabouts. North Korean state media reported that Kim Jong Un had been suffering from "discomfort" and showed images of him walking with a limp. Analysts are discussing how Kim's health issues and his prolonged absence from public life might impact the current power dynamics within North Korea and potentially affect the planned high-level talks.

Should the high-level meetings go ahead as proposed, the topics of discussion are expected to include denuclearization efforts, the reunion of separated families, and the reestablishment of economic cooperation between the two Koreas. Experts have stressed the importance of engaging diplomatically with North Korea, rather than relying exclusively on sanctions and isolation, as this may help create a more conducive environment for advancing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.

However, these developments come with cautious optimism. The history of inter-Korean talks has seen numerous setbacks and failed agreements. The most recent high-level talks, held in February 2014, resulted in a planned reunion of separated families but little progress on other pressing issues. Nevertheless, the prospect of renewed inter-Korean dialogue marks a significant step forward and could potentially pave the way for improving relations between the two Koreas and a gradually more stable and peaceful Korean Peninsula.
