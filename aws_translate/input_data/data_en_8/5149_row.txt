If $44,000 is $1000 less than five times more than he had made on his previous painting, then $44,000 + $1000 = $45,000 is five times what he made on his previous painting. If $45,000 is five times what he made for his previous painting, then he made $45,000 / 5 = $9,000 for selling his previous painting.
The answer: 9000
Reverse engineering the question: Porter is a painter who creates beautiful paintings of wild animals. Most recently, he painted a mural of a pack of wolves standing on a snowy-white mountainside underneath a full moon. He put the painting up for auction and it sold for $1000 less than five times more than he had made on his previous painting. If he received $44,000 for the sale of his most recent painting, how much, in dollars, did he make for selling his previous painting?

Reasoning and answer: The oranges would've cost $6 because 4 x 1.5 = 6. The proportion of their original spending plan was .4 because 6 / 15 = .4. They saved 40% of the money they planned to spend because .4 x 100 = 40.
The answer: 40

Tina wins her first 10, and then wins 5 more for 10 + 5 = 15 wins before losing 1. She then doubles her number of wins for a total of 15 * 2 = 30 wins, before losing 1 more for 1 + 1 = 2 losses. For her career she has 30 - 2 = 28 more wins than losses.
The answer: 28

First find how many carrots Maria needs to cut by multiplying the number of potatoes by 6: 6 * 2 = 12. Then find how many onions she needs by multiplying the number of carrots by 2: 12 * 2 = 24. Finally, divide the number of onions by 3 to find the number of green beans she needs 24 / 3 = 8.
The answer: 8
