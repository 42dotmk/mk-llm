Cousins approaches the task of telling this story by employing a blend of travelogue, literary analysis, and streams of consciousness. The film is grounded in the primary source materials of Lawrence's novel "Sea and Sardinia" and his personal letters, which reveal a deeply personal and intimate connection with Sardinia. However, the film is not without its challenges.

As Cousins dives headfirst into the thoughts and emotions of Lawrence during his time in Sardinia, the viewer must be prepared for a disjointed narrative. It's often difficult to connect to the film's subject matter, as the audience is left feeling that the true essence of the story lies hidden beneath layers of abstraction.

The title of the film, "6 Desires: DH Lawrence and Sardinia," is intended to reflect the six separate journeys undertaken by Lawrence and his wife, Frieda, during their stay on the island. As such, viewers might expect to find the same number of desires within each segment. However, what becomes clear is that the film's true focus is not only on Lawrence's encounters but also on Cousins' own personal journey. This duality serves to blur the lines between the characters, resulting in a more immersive experience for the audience.

Conclusion:
:Discuss the overall impact of the film and the emotions it evokes.
:Describe how the film shines a light on the lesser-known aspect of Lawrence's life and work.
:End with a nod to the unconventional filmmaking techniques employed by Cousins.

Though it may leave some viewers feeling lost and struggling to engage with its content, "6 Desires: DH Lawrence and Sardinia" is ultimately a unique and thought-provoking exploration of the lesser-known aspects of one of the world's greatest literary figures. As with any experimental endeavor, some may question its merit or coherence, but the film remains a testament to the power of unconventional storytelling.

Cousins' unconventional filmmaking, coupled with the beautiful and haunting imagery of Sardinia, invites viewers to reconsider the life and work of D.H. Lawrence through a new lens. Undoubtedly, "6 Desires: DH Lawrence and Sardinia" is a true Sundance standout, even if it leaves some viewers lost somewhere over The Rainbow.
