Airbus Defence and Space, a division of the larger Airbus Group, is a global leader in the aerospace, defense, and space industries. This world-renowned company is known for designing, manufacturing, and delivering cutting-edge products and services catered to the needs of governments, institutions, and commercial clients. As a subsidiary of its parent company, Airbus Group, Airbus Defence and Space benefits from the expertise, resources, and strong foundation provided by the well-established multinational conglomerate.

Established in January 2014, Airbus Defence and Space was formed through the merger of three previously independent businesses - Astrium, Cassidian, and Airbus Military. This consolidation aimed to strengthen the company's position in the international market, enabling it to compete more effectively, respond more swiftly to client requirements, and capitalize on opportunities for growth. Offering an extensive range of products and services, Airbus Defence and Space operates across four main domains: Military Aircraft, Space Systems, Communication-Intelligence-Security (CIS), and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). 

In the field of Military Aircraft, Airbus Defence and Space is responsible for designing and producing a wide array of aircraft types, including fighters, trainers, transporters, and refueling tankers. One of their crowning achievements is the A400M Atlas, an advanced and versatile military transport aircraft. They also manufacture the Eurofighter Typhoon, a key asset for several European air forces.

When it comes to Space Systems, Airbus Defence and Space has been an industry pioneer for over 50 years. They are a key player in commercial telecommunication satellites, developing both geostationary (GEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO) systems. Additionally, the company is involved in Earth observation, navigation, exploration, and scientific missions. A significant project led by Airbus is the development of the Orion European Service Module (ESM), which plays a crucial role in NASA's Artemis program.

The CIS division of Airbus Defence and Space focuses on providing secure communication services, intelligence systems, and cybersecurity solutions. Among their broad range of products are military satellite communication systems, electronic warfare solutions, and cutting-edge encryption technologies. They assist governments, military forces, and organizations in operating securely and maintaining a technological advantage in the context of growing cybersecurity threats.

Lastly, the Unmanned Aerial Systems domain of Airbus Defence and Space deals with the production and development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their associated systems. UAVs serve numerous purposes, from reconnaissance and surveillance to disaster management and communication relay. Among their noteworthy creations is the Zephyr High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite (HAPS), an ultra-lightweight, solar-powered unmanned aircraft designed for sustained surveillance, reconnaissance, and communication relay missions.

With the backing of its parent company, Airbus Group, Airbus Defence and Space continues to forge new paths in its respective domains. Through ongoing innovation and commitment to excellence, this major player in the aerospace, defense, and space industries consistently demonstrates its leadership and unwavering dedication to meeting the needs and addressing the challenges of its global clientele.
