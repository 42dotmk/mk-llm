Q: Benny is baking pies for a bake sale. He plans to make ten pumpkin pies, which cost $3 each to make, and twelve cherry pies, which cost $5 each to make. If he wants to make a profit of $20 selling all the pies, how much does he have to charge for each pie if both kinds sell at the same price?
A: Benny will spend 3 * 10 = $30 to make the pumpkin pies. He will spend 5 * 12 = $60 to make the cherry pies. He wants to make a profit of $20, so he has to earn 30 + 60 + 20 = $110 selling all the pies. He is making 22 pies, so he needs to charge 110 / 22 = $5 per pie. The answer is 5.
Question: Milly's babysitter charges $16/hour. Milly is considering switching to a new babysitter who charges $12/hour, but also charges an extra $3 for each time the kids scream at her. If Milly usually hires the babysitter for 6 hours, and her kids usually scream twice per babysitting gig, how much less will the new babysitter cost?
Answer: First figure out how much the first babysitter costs by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours she works: $16 / hour * 6 hours = $96. Then use the same method to figure out how much the second babysitter charges before any screaming: $12 / hour * 6 hours = $72. Then figure out how much the babysitter charges for two screams: 2 screams * $3 / scream = $6. Finally, subtract the second babysitter's two charges from the first babysitter's total charge to find the difference: $96 - $72 - $6 = $18. The answer is 18.

Q: The population of Mojave was 4000 a decade ago. If the town's population has increased three times, and the population analysis firm predicts that it will increase by 40% after five years, how many people will be in Mojave in five years?
A: Since the population of Mojave has increased three times the number it was a decade ago, there are 3 * 4000 = 12000 people in Mojave now. It's predicted that the population will increase by 40 / 100 * 12000 = 4800 people after five years. This means there will be 12000 + 4800 = 16800 people living in Mojave in five years. The answer is 16800.
Question: Natasha has 3 times as much money as Carla, and Carla has twice as much money as Cosima. If Natasha has $60, and the three decide to buy goods worth the total amount they have and sell the goods at 7/5 of the buying price, how much profit would they make?
Answer: If Natasha has $60, which is 3 times as much money as Carla, Carla has $60 / 3 = $20. Together, Carla and Natasha have $20 + $60 = $80. Carla has twice as much money as Cosima, meaning Cosima has $20 / 2 = $10. Combined, the three have $10 + $80 = $90. If they buy goods with the amount they have and sell at 7 / 5 of the buying price, the total amount of money they will get from selling the goods is 7 / 5 * 90 = $126. If they earn $126 from the sale of the goods they bought with the money they had, their profit is $126 - $90 = $36. The answer is 36.
