Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu walks Tuesday with Reps. John Boehner, left, and Nancy Pelosi. He met with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee first, followed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader John Boehner. An Iranian regime armed with nuclear weapons "is a great danger to all of us, to Israel specifically and to the moderate Arab regimes, [and] to America," Netanyahu said after his meeting with Pelosi and Boehner. "Especially if this regime were to arm itself or arm terrorists with nuclear weapons, the consequences could be unimaginable."
