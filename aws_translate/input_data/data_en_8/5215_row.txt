Aubrey, having successfully involved every student in the interactive activity to teach social skills, would probably want to continue building on that momentum and further enhance the learning experience for the students. Keeping the primary objective in mind, which is the development of social skills, Aubrey could consider the following steps:

1. Assess the outcomes: Before proceeding further, Aubrey might want to assess the impact of the interactive activity on the students. This could involve observing the students and asking for their feedback, which would help identify the strengths and weaknesses of the activity and the extent to which the intended learning outcomes were achieved.

2. Plan follow-up activities: Based on the outcomes of the initial activity, Aubrey might want to design follow-up exercises to reinforce the learned social skills and address any areas that need improvement. These activities can be adjusted according to the students' needs and can take several forms, such as role-playing, group discussions, or even storytelling sessions.

3. Monitor progress: It is crucial for Aubrey to keep track of the students' progress in developing social skills. This can be done through regular observation and evaluation, and by maintaining open communication with the students. Monitoring progress will not only help Aubrey determine the effectiveness of the activities but also allow for timely adjustments and support where needed.

4. Encourage peer-to-peer learning: As students become more comfortable with the social skills they've learned, Aubrey might want to create opportunities for them to teach and help each other. This can further strengthen their understanding of these skills and foster a collaborative, supportive learning environment.

5. Integrate social skills development into other aspects of learning: Instead of treating social skills as a separate topic, Aubrey could integrate it into other subjects or projects. For instance, incorporating elements of teamwork, communication, or empathy into group assignments in different subjects can help students realize the importance and relevance of social skills in various contexts.

6. Bridge the learning to real-life situations: Aubrey might want to help students apply their newfound social skills outside the classroom. This could involve arranging visits to elderly care homes, encouraging volunteer work, or connecting with other schools for joint social projects. Such experiences would provide students with practical opportunities to practice and refine their social skills in real-life situations.

7. Maintain a positive and safe learning environment: Lastly, Aubrey must ensure that the classroom remains a space where students feel comfortable to express themselves, learn from their mistakes, and receive constructive feedback. A nurturing, non-judgmental environment will support the students' growth and foster a positive attitude towards the development of social skills.

In summary, following the success of the interactive activity, Aubrey might want to assess its outcomes, plan follow-up activities, monitor progress, encourage peer-to-peer learning, integrate social skills development into other aspects of learning, and create opportunities for applying skills in real-life situations. By doing so, Aubrey would not only facilitate the students' growth in social skills but also help them become more empathetic, compassionate, and responsible individuals.
