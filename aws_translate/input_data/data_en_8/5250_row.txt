Firstly, let me address the two questions separately and provide detailed answers for each.

1) Where is Dakota Fred from Gold Rush now?

Dakota Fred, whose real name is Fred Hurt, is a gold miner and a reality TV personality known for his appearances on the popular Discovery Channel reality show, Gold Rush. He first appeared on the show in its second season and continued to participate until the fourth season. After his time on the main show, Dakota Fred went on to star in his own spin-off series, Gold Rush: White Water, along with his son, Dustin Hurt.

As of now, Dakota Fred is still involved in gold mining and continues to appear on Gold Rush: White Water. The show focuses on the father-son duo's extreme gold mining adventures in the Alaskan wilderness, as they try to extract gold deposits from underwater crevices. You can follow Dakota Fred's latest activities and updates through his official social media channels, such as Facebook and Twitter.

2) Where is the Friends cast now?

The popular sitcom Friends aired from 1994 to 2004 and starred Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer as six friends living in New York City. After the show ended, the cast members continued their careers in various fields of the entertainment industry. Here's an update on each of the main cast members:

- Jennifer Aniston (Rachel Green): Aniston has maintained a successful acting career, starring in multiple films like Marley & Me, The Break-Up, and Dumplin'. She's also the co-founder of a hair care company called Living Proof. In 2019, she returned to television in the Apple TV+ drama series, The Morning Show, alongside Reese Witherspoon.

He later starred in the BBC series Episodes and hosted BBC's Top Gear. He currently stars in the CBS sitcom, Man with a Plan.

- David Schwimmer (Ross Geller): Schwimmer has acted in both theater and film, and has directed multiple television episodes and movies. He starred as Robert Kardashian in the acclaimed series American Crime Story: The People vs. O.J. Simpson and provided voice talent for the Madagascar film series.

Now, addressing the question of whether these two questions are the same or not: No, these two questions are not the same. Each of them pertains to a different topic; the first question relates to a specific individual, Dakota Fred, from a reality TV show about gold mining, while the second question refers to the cast members of the long-running sitcom, Friends, and their lives after the show's conclusion.
