The two questions you have asked are not the same. The first question is about becoming rich in India, while the second question is about setting up a new political party in India and becoming Prime Minister. The answer to your initial inquiry is *no*, these questions address different topics. 

Now, let's address each question in detail.

1. What is the best way to become rich in India?

There is no perfect formula for becoming wealthy, but here are some possible paths to accumulating wealth in India:

a. Entrepreneurship: Starting your own business can be a path to wealth if you are able to identify and develop a unique idea. To be successful, you would need to conduct thorough market research, create a solid business plan, and work tirelessly to develop and expand the business.

b. Real estate: Many wealthy individuals have built their fortunes through real estate investments, either by purchasing properties in upcoming locations and waiting for their value to increase, or by developing real estate themselves.

c. Stock market investments: While investing in the stock market may require capital and involves risks, it is an avenue that has the potential for substantial returns if done wisely.

d. Education and expertise: Acquiring an in-demand skill set or becoming an expert in a particular industry can lead to higher-paying job opportunities or enable you to open a successful consultancy firm.

e. Passive income: Creating streams of passive income, such as writing a best-selling book, creating an app, or securing royalties from patents, may require initial effort and investment but can lead to long-term wealth accumulation.

2. What is the best way to set up a new political party in India and become PM?

Becoming the Prime Minister of India involves setting up a political party and building public support. Here are some steps to consider:

a. Familiarize yourself with the existing political landscape and identify the gaps or weaknesses that your new party can address. 

b. Develop a clear and coherent party ideology and platform. This should cover a range of social, economic, and political issues, as well as providing concrete solutions to the problems your party aims to address.

c. Form a core group of committed individuals who share your vision and are willing to take on various responsibilities within the party organization.

d. Register the new political party with the Election Commission of India to obtain official recognition.

e. Build a strong party infrastructure that includes a central office, state and district offices, as well as local units. This will enable your party to function efficiently and maintain grassroots connections.

f. Develop a sound campaign strategy that focuses on effective communication of your party's message, identifying vote banks, and connecting with the wider public.

g. Work to gain support by participating in local and national elections. Winning seats in various levels of government will help solidify your party's presence and establish its credibility.

h. As the leader of the political party, you should strive to develop your image as a capable, trustworthy, and far-sighted statesperson. Building credibility and public trust would be essential to your bid for the Prime Minister's position.

It is important to note that both becoming wealthy and becoming the Prime Minister of India are ambitious goals that require immense dedication, strategic planning, and hard work to achieve.
