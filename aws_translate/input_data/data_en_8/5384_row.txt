One day, during an important operation aimed at acquiring sensitive intelligence, Jerry and Thorndike cross paths with Madeline Blackwood, a double agent working for the enemy organization. Madeline tries to seduce Thorndike to betray the organization in exchange for a life of luxury and power within the enemy group. However, Thorndike remains loyal and refuses to give in to her tempting offers. Jerry, who notices the interaction from afar, becomes suspicious of Madeline's intentions.

As the story progresses, Jerry follows Madeline Blackwood to unravel her true mission, leading him to the enemy headquarters. During his infiltration attempt, Jerry encounters Quive-Smith, who reveals that he has been monitoring both Jerry and Thorndike since Madeline Blackwood entered the scene.

Stating his loyalty to the organization, Quive-Smith engages in a fierce battle with Jerry, ultimately wounding him but not before Jerry manages to eliminate several enemy agents. Exhausting his last breath, Jerry makes Quive-Smith promise to inform Thorndike about his fate, including the truth about Madeline Blackwood.

With Jerry's demise, Quive-Smith now faces imminent danger as his presence in the enemy headquarters becomes increasingly risky. Despite his cold demeanor, Quive-Smith decides to honor Jerry's last wish and escape the facility to return to the organization.

Upon reaching the organization, Quive-Smith informs Thorndike about Jerry's heroic actions and selfless sacrifice. The news of Jerry's death devastates Thorndike, fueling his determination to avenge his best friend's passing. With the intel provided by Quive-Smith, Thorndike now knows the true identity of Madeline Blackwood and sets in motion an elaborate plan to disarm her and the enemy organization.
