Steenkamp's hip. Furthermore, Saayman stated that the third bullet, which struck Steenkamp's head, would have caused massive trauma and instant incapacitation, rendering her unable to respond, meaning any further shots would have been unnecessary.

The prosecution used this testimony to argue that Pistorius' claim of mistaking Steenkamp for an intruder was false, as her screams should have been audible to him. However, as the trial progressed, the defense team, led by Barry Roux, began to poke holes in the prosecution's case. They focused primarily on forensic and ballistic evidence.

Roux brought in an independent forensic expert, Dr. David Klatzow, who examined the ballistic and blood spatter evidence at the crime scene. Klatzow criticized the police's handling of the case, noting that many pieces of evidence had been contaminated. For instance, the position of the bullet casings had been disturbed during the investigation, making it difficult to reconstruct the exact sequence of events.

Roux also successfully challenged elements of Saayman's testimony. He questioned several of the prosecution's expert witnesses, raising doubts about their conclusions. The defense argued that the meal Steenkamp supposedly ate two hours before her death could have been a snack rather than a full meal, possibly in response to a bout of insomnia. Roux also brought forth witnesses who testified that Pistorius, despite his disability, could easily have confused Steenkamp's screams for those of an intruder.

As the trial drew to a close, there were few definitive answers regarding Pistorius' actions on that fateful night. Judge Thokozile Masipa, along with her assessors, deliberated for several weeks before delivering their verdict.

In the end, Judge Masipa found Oscar Pistorius guilty of culpable homicide but acquitted him of premeditated murder. This decision came as a shock to many who had expected a murder conviction. The Judge cited a lack of conclusive evidence proving that Pistorius knowingly killed Steenkamp.

Pistorius was sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison, with the possibility of parole after serving at least one-third of his sentence. He began serving his sentence at the Kgosi Mampuru II Correctional Center in Pretoria in October 2014.

Reeva Steenkamp's family and the prosecution expressed disappointment with the verdict and sentence, viewing it as too lenient. The state went on to appeal the conviction and sentencing in the Supreme Court of Appeal. In December 2015, the original verdict was overturned, and the court found Pistorius guilty of murder, with the presiding Judge Lorimer Leach stating that the initial judgment had been "fundamentally flawed."

The case returned to the Pretoria High Court for sentencing, and in July 2016, Judge Masipa sentenced Pistorius to six years in prison. The state appealed the sentence again, calling it "shockingly lenient." Ultimately, in November 2017, the South African Supreme Court of Appeal increased Pistorius' sentence from six years to 13 years and five months.

As the legal process finally reached its conclusion, Oscar Pistorius remained in prison, his hopes of returning to the world of professional sports shattered. The tragic death of Reeva Steenkamp and the dramatic trial that followed will forever remain a pivotal moment in South African legal history, serving as a stark reminder of the complex issues surrounding crime, justice, and celebrity.
