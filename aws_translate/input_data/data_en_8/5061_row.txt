[Question]An office has 90 workers. 2/3rds of them are men and the rest are women. The company hires 10 new employees and 100% of them are women. What is the total percentage of women in the company now?
[Answer]1 / 3rd of the workers before the new hires were women because 1 - (2 / 3) = 1 / 3. There were 30 women working for the company before the new hires. There are now 40 women working for the company because 30 + 10 = 40. There are 100 people working for the company because 90 + 10 = 100. The proportion of women working in the company is .4 because 40 / 100 = .4. The percentage of women working in the company is now 40 because .4 x 100 = 40. The answer is 40.
Q: Of the 600 students at River Falls High School, 3/4 of them play tennis. Of those that play tennis, 60% of them also play hockey. How many students play both hockey and tennis?

Question: Ms. Alice can grade 296 papers in 8 hours. How many papers can she grade in 11 hours?
Answer: First you must recognize that the problem involves finding the rate of how fast Ms. Alice can grade papers. To find how many papers she can grade in 11 hours, it would be useful to first find out how many papers she can grade in one hour. To do so, divide 296 papers by 8 hours, 296 / 8, to get 37. Therefore, Ms. Alice can grade 37 papers in one hour. To find out how many papers she can grade in 11 hours, multiply the number of papers she can grade in one hour by 11. 37 * 11 gives you 407. Ms. Alice can grade 407 papers in 11 hours. The answer is 407.
[Question]Bubba bought a new two-story warehouse. When empty, the first floor of the building contains twice as much floor space for storage as the second floor. The first items he brought into his empty building were several thousand boxes; and he put them all on the second floor, which filled one-quarter of the second floor storage space. If the boxes used up 5,000 square feet of storage space, how many square feet of storage space is still available in the building?
[Answer]If 5,000 square feet represents one - quarter of the second floor storage space, then the second floor has 5,000 * 4 = 20,000 square feet of storage space. Since the first floor has twice as much space as the second floor, then the first floor has 20,000 * 2 = 40,000 square feet of storage space. Altogether, when empty, the entire building has 20,000 + 40,000 = 60,000 square feet of storage space. Since the second floor has 5,000 square feet of storage space filled with boxes, then there are 60,000 - 5,000 = 55,000 square feet of unused storage space still available in the building. The answer is 55000.
Q: James buys a weight vest for $250. He then buys 200 pounds of weight plates for $1.2 per pound. A 200-pound weight vest would cost $700 but there is a $100 discount. How much does he save with his vest?
A: The weight plates cost 200 * 1.2 = $240. So his vest cost 250 + 240 = $490. He could get the other vest for 700 - 100 = $600. So he saved 600 - 490 = $110. The answer is 110.
