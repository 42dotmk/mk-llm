[Question]Elliott drew a right-angle triangle on his book. It had a base of 4 inches, a height of 3 inches and a certain length of the hypotenuse. What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?
[Answer]Since the hypotenuse of a triangle is found by the square root of the base squared plus the height squared. The square of the base of the first triangle is 4 * 4 = 16 square inches. The square of the height of the first triangle is 3 * 3 = 9 square inches. The sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16 + 9 = 25. The square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is √25 = 5 inches. Since the perimeter of a triangle is found by adding the sides of the triangle, the base and height of the triangle sum up to 3 + 4 = 7 inches. If you add the hypotenuse of the triangle the perimeter of the triangle becomes 7 + 5 = 12 inches. The answer is 12.
Q: Kyle makes $3200.00 every month. His monthly bills include $1250 for rent, $150 on utilities, $400 into retirement & savings accounts, $300.00 on groceries/eating out, $200 for insurance and $200 for miscellaneous expenses. If he’s looking at buying a car with a monthly car payment of $350 how much does that leave for gas and maintenance?
A: Kyle’s monthly bills are 1250 + 150 + 400 + 300 + 200 + 200 = $2,500.00. He makes $3200 and his bills are $2500 so that leaves 3200 - 2500 = $700.00. If he buys a car with a monthly car payment of $350 then that leaves 700 - 350 = $350.00 left over for gas and maintenance. The answer is 350.
Question: Cowboy Mickey and cowgirl Minnie train horses for a living. On average, Mickey mounts six less than twice as many horses per day as does Minnie, while Minnie mounts three more horses per day than there are days in a week. How many horses does Mickey Mount per week?
Answer: If Minnie mounts three more horses per day than there are days in a week, then Minnie mounts 7 + 3 = 10 horses per day. Twice as many horses per day as Minnie mounts is 10 * 2 = 20 horses per day. If Mickey mounts six less than twice as many horses per day as does Minnie, then Mickey mounts 20 - 6 = 14 horses per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, then Mickey mounts 7 * 14 = 98 horses per week. The answer is 98.
[Question]The school is hosting a race after school. The winner is the person who runs the most laps around the school in 12 minutes. One lap around the school is 100 meters. The winner is awarded a gift certificate equal to $3.5 for every one hundred meters they run. The winner runs 24 laps around the school. On average, how much did they earn per minute?
[Answer]They ran 2,400 meters because 24 laps x 100 m / lap = 2400 m. They ran 200 meters per minute because 2400 m / 12 min = 200 m / min. For every minute they ran they earned an average of $7 because $3.5 / 100m x 200 m / min = $7 / min. The answer is 7.
