Shinichi, a high school student with a sharp sense of justice, finds his life forever changed when a parasitic alien named Migi merges with his right hand. Despite the initial shock and fear, they form a reluctant partnership in order to ensure their mutual survival. With a newly awakened determination, Shinichi decides to track down and fight off other alien parasites that have invaded Earth, all the while receiving assistance from the resourceful Migi.

As Shinichi continues to hunt down these parasitic beings, Tamiya, a mysterious and intelligent woman with her own hidden agenda, urges him to stop getting involved. She recognizes Shinichi and Migi's unique bond and believes they pose a significant threat to the parasites. To help him avoid any unnecessary danger, she warns him to stay out of the conflict for the sake of his own safety. However, her efforts to help only strengthen Shinichi's resolve, as he realizes that he cannot simply sit back and allow these parasites to wreak havoc on humanity.

Meanwhile, Kuramori, an experienced detective previously contracted by Tamiya to investigate the parasites, is consumed with anger following the death of his family at the creatures' hands. Despite Tamiya and Shinichi's attempts to reason with him and convince him to stay out of their unseen war, Kuramori is relentless in his pursuit of vengeance. Tragically, his determination ultimately proves to be his undoing, as he meets a grisly end at Tamiya's hands during a tense confrontation.

With Kuramori's demise, Shinichi and Migi turn their attention to Hirokawa, an enigmatic figure who serves as the parasites' de facto leader. Assuming that he is a dangerous parasite like his accomplices, they carefully strategize a plan to eliminate this major threat. However, in a shocking twist, it is revealed that Hirokawa himself is actually human. His allegiance to the parasites stems from a twisted belief that they are a vital force of nature, existing to control the overpopulation of the human species.

Despite the unexpected revelation, Shinichi and Migi's fight is far from over. They suddenly find themselves faced with the remaining parasite, whose power surpasses anything they've faced before. It becomes evident that this opponent may prove to be too formidable for their duo to confront alone. Desperate and determined, they team up with Tamiya, joining forces to face their shared enemy.

As the diverse group comes together to face this daunting challenge, they are forced to address their differences and question the blurry line between friend and enemy. Each member of the team must confront their personal motivations and fears, as they devise a strategy to defeat this overwhelming adversary.

The ensuing battle is a grueling test of their combined strength, cunning, and bond. Ultimately, the fate of the world, as well as the fate of their own lives, depends on the success of their alliance. In the face of such a powerful entity, the unlikely alliance must stand strong, pushing themselves to their mental, moral, and physical limits in the hope to protect Earth and humanity.

The seemingly insurmountable challenge is a turning point for Shinichi and Migi, as they are forced to reflect upon their relationship with other humans and parasites alike. Despite the bleak reality they're confronted with, the two find solace in their partnership and better understand their role in this ongoing struggle between their two very different worlds.
