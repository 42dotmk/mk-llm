Question: Todd borrowed $100 from his brother to start a snow-cone stand. He has to repay him $110 as soon as he can. Todd spent $75 on ingredients for the snow cones. He sells 200 of them for $.75 each. After he pays back his brother, how much money does Todd have?
Answer: Todd has $25 left after buying ingredients because 100 - 75 = 25. Todd made $150 selling snow - cones because 200 x .75 = 150. Todd has $175 before he pays his brother back because 25 + 150 = 175. After Todd pays his brother back he has $65 because 175 - 110 = 65. The answer is 65.
[Question]Asha has to buy some gifts but has no money. She decides to borrow $20 from her brother, $40 from her father, $30 from her mother and is gifted $70 by her granny. She adds this to her savings of $100 and goes out to Target to get what she wanted. If she spent 3/4 of the money, how much money did she remain with?
[Answer]With the amount borrowed from her family, she has a total of 20 + 40 + 30 = 90 dollars. With the amount gifted from her granny, she has 70 + 90 = 160 dollars. She adds this to her savings, ending up with a total of 160 + 100 = 260 dollars. She spends 3 / 4 of this money, which is 3 / 4 * 260 = 195 dollars. The total she remains with is 260 - 195 = 65 dollars. The answer is 65.
Q: To make room for a new inventory of books, Gordon's local bookstore is offering 30% off any book that is over $22.00 and 20% off any book under $20.00. He buys several books with the following prices; $25.00, $18.00, $21.00, $35.00, $12.00 and $10.00. How much will he spend on books?
A: He gets 30% off any book over $22 and he buys books that cost $25.00 and $35.00 so the total cost of these books is $25 + $35 = $60.00. At 30% off, the discount on these books is $60 * .30 = $18.00. That mean these 2 books will cost $60 - $18 = $42.00. He gets 20% off any book under $20 and he buys books for $18.00, $12.00 and $10.00 so these books together cost $18 + $12 + $10 = $40.00. at 20% off, the discount on these books is 40 * .20 = $8.00. So these 3 books will cost $40 - $8 = $32.00. He has spent $42.00 on the two most expensive books, $32.00 on the 3 cheapest books, and also bought a book for $21.00, so his total comes to $42 + $32 + $21 = $95.00. The answer is 95.
Question: Martha has 20 apples. She decided to split them among her friends. Jane got 5 apples from her, and James got 2 more than Jane. How many more apples would Martha need to give away to be left with only 4 of them?
Answer: Martha gave James 5 + 2 = 7 apples. So Martha was left with 20 - 5 - 7 = 8 apples. To be left with only 4 apples, Martha would need to give away 8 - 4 = 4 more apples. The answer is 4.
[Question]Five years ago, the sum of Sebastian's age and his sister's age was 3/4 of their father's age. How old is their father today if Sebastian is 40 years old and 10 years older than his sister?
[Answer]If Sebastian is 40 years old and 10 years older than his sister, his sister is 40 - 10 = 30 years old. Five years ago, Sebastian was 40 - 5 = 35 years old. Similarly, Sebastian's sister's age was 30 - 5 = 25 years old. The sum of their ages five years ago was 25 + 35 = 60. Five years ago, the sum of Sebastian's age and his sister's age was 3 / 4 of their father's age, meaning their father's age was 60 / 3 / 4 = 80 years. The father's age is now 80 + 5 = 85. The answer is 85.
