To make homemade deer jerky, you should follow the second option, which focuses specifically on using deer loin. Here is a detailed and long answer on how to accomplish this goal:

1. Prepare the necessary ingredients and equipment:
- Deer loin
- Ziplock bags or airtight containers (for marinating)
- Italian dressing
- Your favorite jerky seasonings (e.g., salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, etc.)
- A dehydrator with adjustable temperature control
- Paper towels or clean kitchen towels (for drying the meat)

2. Defrost the deer loin:
- Ensure you properly defrost the deer loin in the refrigerator. This process may take 12-24 hours, depending on the size of the loin. Place it on a tray or in a container to catch any drips and avoid cross-contamination.

3. Prepare the marinade:
- In a bowl, combine the Italian dressing and your preferred seasonings. You can use a store-bought dressing or make your own by mixing olive oil, vinegar, oregano, basil, garlic, salt, and pepper. Experiment with different seasonings, such as red pepper flakes, brown sugar, soy sauce, or even pineapple juice, to create your desired flavor.

4. Trim and slice the deer loin:
- Once the deer loin is fully defrosted, trim any excess fat or connective tissue. Slice the loin into thin strips, approximately 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. This ensures the jerky will dry evenly and thoroughly. For a more tender jerky, slice against the grain. If you prefer a more chewy texture, slice the meat with the grain.

5. Marinate the deer loin:
- Place the sliced deer loin strips in a Ziplock bag or airtight container. Pour the marinade over the meat, ensuring every piece is thoroughly coated. Seal the container or bag, removing any excess air. Place the container in the refrigerator and let the deer loin marinate overnight, or for at least 8-12 hours. The longer the marination, the more flavorful the jerky will be.

6. Preheat the dehydrator:
- Before removing the marinated deer loin from the refrigerator, set up your dehydrator according to the manufacturer's instructions and preheat it to the meat setting, typically around 160°F (71°C).

7. Drain and pat the deer loin dry:
- Remove the marinated deer loin strips from the refrigerator and drain off any excess marinade. Using paper towels or clean kitchen towels, pat the strips dry to remove excess surface moisture. This will help the jerky dehydrate more quickly and help achieve a consistent texture.

8. Arrange the deer loin strips in the dehydrator:
- Place the dried deer loin strips in a single layer on the dehydrator trays, ensuring they do not touch or overlap. This allows for ample airflow and even dehydration.

9. Dehydrate the deer jerky:
- Turn the dehydrator on and let it run until the deer jerky reaches your desired texture. This may take anywhere from 4 to 12 hours, depending on the thickness of the meat, your dehydrator, and personal preferences. Check the jerky periodically for doneness. It should be firm and leathery, yet bendable and easy to tear.

10. Cool and store the deer jerky:
- When the jerky is done, remove it from the dehydrator and let it cool to room temperature on clean trays or a wire rack. Once cooled, store the jerky in an airtight container or plastic Ziplock bag for up to two weeks at room temperature, or freeze it for longer-term storage.

By following these instructions, you will be able to create delicious homemade deer jerky that can be enjoyed as a nutritious, high-protein snack.
