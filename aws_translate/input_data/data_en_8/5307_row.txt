Title: Beyond Time's Reach

Genre: Drama, Thriller, Mystery

Plot:

In a quaint, picturesque town in northern India, lives a brilliant mathematician and scientist, Dr. Ranjeet Khurana. Dr. Khurana, in his mid-30's, has spent most of his life working on a top-secret government project. However, his family and ordinary townsfolk are oblivious to this aspect of his life, knowing him only as a warm and helpful chemistry teacher at the local high school.

Dr. Khurana's life takes a sudden turn when he discovers an unusual stone with unearthly properties while on a family picnic. Enthralled by the stone's unique capabilities, Ranjeet takes it back to his home and begins investigating it, unknowingly uncovering its connection to his past, present, and future.

As he delves deeper into understanding the complexities around the stone, Ranjeet stumbles upon the fact that it isn't merely a historical artifact, but a portal to the past. Excited by the implications and possibilities, Ranjeet cautiously ventures back in time to revisit episodes from his youth, including the tragic death of his childhood best friend, Vikas, and the heartbreak he experienced when his first love, Naina, moved away.

Intrigued by the portal's possibilities, a much younger Dr. Khurana, still in his teenage years, decides to delve into the future and finds himself face-to-face with his present-day self. This encounter creates a generational loop amongst the various ages of Ranjeet – teenage, present-day and even an older version in his 60's – compelling them to work together to solve an impending disaster that threatens to unravel the fabric of time and space.

Dealing with their own personal struggles and bearing the burden of saving the world, the three versions of Ranjeet – each with their unique perspectives and experiences – form an unbreakable bond that transcends age, realizing that it isn't just about averting the disaster; it's about the choices they made in life and the significance of their relationships.

In the present time, older Ranjeet ensures that current Ranjeet uses the stone to prevent the tragedy involving Vikas by presenting himself just in the nick of time. Meanwhile, present-day Ranjeet tracks down Naina and brings closure to their love story by ensuring her successful and happy life. Through a series of trials and tribulations, the familial circle becomes complete once again.

However, the cost of altering the past begins to manifest, as the town experiences strange and inexplicable occurrences. Realizing that their actions have resulted in dire consequences, the trio decides to use the stone one last time to reunite and undo their transgressions. In the process, they destroy the stone to prevent any further disruptions to the timeline, but, unfortunately, this means that their bond and the heartwarming moments they experienced together will be locked away in a forgotten corner of time.

In the end, Dr. Ranjeet Khurana is no longer the man he was. He cannot remember the unique camaraderie he shared with his younger and older selves, but he knows that he made a difference – not just to the ones he loved but also to the world at large. The movie culminates with the older Ranjeet passing away peacefully, surrounded by family, as the camera pans out to a park bench where the three versions of Ranjeet have etched their names – a subtle reminder that beyond time's reach, they were brothers across ages, bound by destiny, and truly unforgettable.
