In order to provide a detailed and long answer, I will outline both the solutions and discuss the naive physics reasoning behind them. After assessing the strengths and weaknesses of each solution, it will be easier to determine which one is more sound.

Solution 1: A Homemade Olive Oil and Lemon Furniture Polish
Ingredients:
- 1 cup of olive oil
- 1/4 cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice

Procedure:
1. Mix the olive oil and lemon juice in a glass jar or a spray bottle. 
2. Shake the container well to combine the ingredients, as the oil and lemon juice are immiscible liquids and may separate.
3. Apply a small amount of the polish to a clean, soft cloth or microfiber cloth.
4. Gently rub the cloth onto the wood furniture in circular motions, working on small sections at a time.
5. Allow the polish to absorb into the wood for a few minutes, then buff with a clean cloth to reveal a natural shine.
6. Store the remaining polish in a cool, dark place for future use.

Naive Physics Reasoning: This solution uses olive oil, a natural substance with conditioning properties that nourish and protect the wood. The lemon juice adds a light, fresh scent and provides mild cleaning properties that help remove surface dirt. Together, these ingredients create a simple yet effective non-toxic wood furniture polish that gives a natural shine without causing damage to the wood or leaving harmful chemical residues.

Solution 2: A Homemade Beeswax and Coconut Oil Furniture Polish
Ingredients:
- 1/4 cup of beeswax pellets or grated beeswax
- 3/4 cup of coconut oil

Procedure:
1. In a double boiler or a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water, melt the beeswax. Be sure not to let the water come into direct contact with the beeswax.
2. Once the beeswax has melted, add the coconut oil. Stir gently until the coconut oil has melted and combined with the beeswax.
3. Remove the mixture from heat and let it cool slightly. Pour the liquid into a glass jar and allow it to solidify. Once cooled, it will form a thick paste.
4. To use, apply a small amount of the polish with a clean, soft cloth, working in circular motions and covering small sections of the wood at a time.
5. Allow the polish to absorb into the wood for about 30 minutes.
6. Buff the surface of the furniture with a clean cloth to remove any excess polish and reveal a protective, natural shine.

Naive Physics Reasoning: This solution uses beeswax and coconut oil, both natural substances that have conditioning and protective properties. Beeswax helps seal and protect the wood, while coconut oil nourishes and moisturizes the surface. The combination of these two ingredients creates a highly effective non-toxic wood furniture polish that provides long-lasting protection and a lustrous shine without exposing the wood or the user to harmful chemicals.

Conclusion: Based on naive physics reasoning, both solutions can effectively polish and protect wood furniture without using toxic chemicals. However, the beeswax and coconut oil furniture polish (Solution 2) seems to be a more sound solution, as it provides a long-lasting protective barrier and a more durable shine. The olive oil and lemon polish (Solution 1) may require more frequent applications due to the quick-absorbing nature of olive oil and the mild cleaning action of lemon juice. Ultimately, both solutions are non-toxic and suitable for maintaining wood furniture, but Solution 2 is preferred for its sturdiness and extended protective qualities.
