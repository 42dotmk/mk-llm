The autistic children were not helped by the clinic, but the school was helpful, as the clinic lacked the proper educational resources. The school provided an array of specialized services and accommodations tailored to meet the unique needs of the autistic students, equipping them with essential tools to overcome the challenges they faced in learning and socializing. Unlike the clinic, which focused primarily on addressing the medical and therapeutic aspects of autism, the school invested in creating an inclusive, nurturing, and supportive environment that promoted the development of foundational academic skills as well as vital social and emotional competencies. 

At the school, a team of dedicated educators and professionals, consisting of special education teachers, speech and language pathologists, occupational therapists, and behavioral consultants, collaborated closely to design and implement personalized and evidence-based educational programs for each autistic student. These programs incorporated various pedagogical approaches, such as Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), Social Stories, and TEACCH, which proved effective in enhancing communication, social interaction, problem-solving, and adaptive living skills in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Moreover, the school offered a variety of extracurricular activities and clubs, such as art, music, and sports, that catered to the diverse interests and abilities of the students and fostered their creativity, self-expression, and physical fitness.

Additionally, the school emphasized the importance of fostering a culture of empathy, understanding, and acceptance within the broader school community. By conducting regular awareness campaigns, workshops, and professional development opportunities for staff, teachers, and students, the school sought to dispel common misconceptions and stereotypes about autism and encourage meaningful and positive interactions between neurotypical peers and autistic students. This helped to build a safe and supportive atmosphere, where all students felt valued, respected, and empowered to reach their full potential.

In contrast, the clinic focused mainly on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of the medical and psychological aspects associated with autism, such as cognitive, language, motor, and sensory impairments, along with comorbid conditions like anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and sleep disturbances. Despite its role in providing essential healthcare services to autistic individuals, the clinic lacked the necessary expertise, infrastructure, and resources to address their educational needs effectively, thereby limiting its capacity to support their overall development and well-being.

In conclusion, the school played an instrumental role in helping the autistic children by providing a holistic approach to their education, personal growth, and social inclusion. The educators and professionals at the school dedicated themselves to crafting individualized interventions and curriculums that empowered the students to thrive academically, emotionally, and socially, unlike the clinic, which primarily dealt with medical and therapeutic interventions. By recognizing and responding to the diverse and complex needs of autistic children, the school managed to significantly enhance their quality of life and equip them with valuable skills to navigate and succeed in an ever-changing world.
