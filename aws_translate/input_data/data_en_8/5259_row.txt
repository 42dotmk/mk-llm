Title: Kara and the Shadow of Darkseid

Plot summary: In a bold and breathtaking sci-fi adventure, Supergirl (Kara Zor-El) faces her most formidable adversary yet as she strives to save Earth and its people. When Darkseid, a brutal New God and ruler of Apokolips, learns of Kara's presence on Earth, he sees her as the key to crushing Earth's resistance, but he underestimates the strength and determination of this heroine and those who stand by her side.

Act 1: Earth's New Hero

The film opens with Kara Zor-El, also known as Supergirl, establishing her presence on Earth as its newest protector after Superman (her cousin) goes off-world to handle another cosmic threat. People quickly embrace their new heroine, who saves lives, prevents catastrophes, and inspires hope in the hearts of citizens across the globe.

Meanwhile, on the ominous world of Apokolips, Darkseid broods. His previously failed attempts to subdue Earth have left him frustrated and more determined than ever to assert his dominance over the planet he considers weak. Darkseid's trusted commander, Desaad, brings news of a powerful new warrior on Earth – Supergirl.

Act 2: A Masterplan Unveiled

Intrigued by this development, Darkseid devises a plan to exploit Kara's powers for his own evil purposes. He dispatches his elite force of Female Furies, led by the deadly Lashina, to Earth to capture Supergirl and bring her back to Apokolips. Darkseid also sends the shape-shifting mercenary, Sleez, to infiltrate Earth's defenses and weaken them from within.

On Earth, Kara soon learns of unsettling incidents: people and heroes going missing, alien technology sabotaged, and escalating hysteria around the world. As she investigates, she encounters the Female Furies and battles them in a thrilling rooftop fight. Despite her powers, Kara is captured and brought to Apokolips.

Act 3: The Battle for Earth and Beyond

While imprisoned on Apokolips, Supergirl meets a group of brave rebels led by the enigmatic Forager. They share their stories of defiance against Darkseid's cruel regime and inspire Kara to join their cause.

Together, Kara and the rebels wage a rebellion against Darkseid and his forces. Their bravery inspires heroes back on Earth, led by Wonder Woman, who have uncovered Sleez's manipulations and work to eradicate his influence.

In the climactic battle, Supergirl faces off against Darkseid, matching her strength with his cunning and brutal power. The conflict between them rages across Apokolips, inflicting devastating damage on both sides.

With the help of her newfound allies, Kara finally overpowers Darkseid and prevents him from extracting and weaponizing her powers. The Female Furies are defeated, and the forces of Apokolips retreat.

Act 4: A New Dawn

In the aftermath, Supergirl has not only saved Earth, but also planted seeds of hope amid the darkness on Apokolips. The rebellion, inspired by Kara's compassion and strength, grows stronger, igniting a glimmer of hope for the oppressed citizens of Apokolips.

Supergirl returns to Earth as a more experienced hero, ready to continue standing up against injustice. She knows that Darkseid may one day return, but she and her fellow defenders of Earth will be prepared to face him – together.

Kara and the Shadow of Darkseid is an epic story that combines thrilling superhero action, powerful emotional arcs, and a broader message of unity, hope, and the indomitable human spirit in the face of overwhelming darkness.
