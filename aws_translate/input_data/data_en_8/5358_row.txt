In addition to this, I would like to thank Member Medina Ortega for his insights, which are based on his experiences of what it is like to fish in the Comoros and the Indian Ocean.

The given text is in Finnish, and after translating it to English, it shows an expression of gratitude towards Member Medina Ortega for sharing his knowledge and experiences of fishing in the Comoros and the Indian Ocean. The Comoros is an island nation situated in the Indian Ocean, located between the eastern coast of Africa and Madagascar. Fishing is a vital industry for the economy of the Comoros and plays an essential role in providing food and livelihoods for local communities. Meanwhile, the Indian Ocean, being the third-largest ocean in the world, supports a diverse array of marine life and is home to many different commercial and recreational fisheries.

Member Medina Ortega's experiences fishing in these areas provide valuable firsthand knowledge about the various challenges, opportunities, and nuances associated with fishing in these unique environments. Such insights can be helpful to inform decision-making and management strategies for sustainable fisheries in these regions and beyond. By acknowledging and thanking Member Medina Ortega for his contributions, the speaker highlights the significance of incorporating local knowledge and experiences in understanding complex issues related to fishing and ocean conservation.

Fishing in the Comoros and the Indian Ocean presents a wide range of challenges and opportunities. For one, overfishing is a significant concern in many parts of the Indian Ocean, as some fish stocks are severely depleted due to unsustainable fishing practices, such as illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Climate change has further exacerbated these issues, as rising ocean temperatures and acidification affect fish stocks and their habitats. To ensure the long-term sustainability and viability of these ecosystems, it is crucial to establish and enforce appropriate fishing policies and regulations, conduct research on specific fish populations and their dynamics, and invest in eco-friendly fishing technologies and practices.

On the other hand, the fishing industry also presents numerous opportunities for growth and development. For instance, by implementing sustainable and innovative fishing practices in alignment with ecosystem-based approaches, fisheries can maintain the integrity of marine ecosystems and continue providing food and livelihoods for coastal communities. Enhancements in technology, such as the use of monitoring and traceability tools, can support better enforcement of fishing regulations and combat IUU fishing. Moreover, promoting collaboration and partnerships among countries, as well as involving various stakeholders within the fishing industry, including local fishermen, can help ensure that policies are well-informed and tailored to the specific needs of the different regions.

In summary, recognizing and appreciating the experiences and perspectives of people directly involved in fishing, like Member Medina Ortega, is essential in understanding the various complexities and challenges associated with this industry in unique areas such as the Comoros and the Indian Ocean. This appreciation emphasizes the importance of combining scientific knowledge, policy frameworks, and local expertise in addressing and managing sustainable fisheries and preserving marine ecosystems for future generations.
