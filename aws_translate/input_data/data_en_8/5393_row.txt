[Question]A carton of ice cream contains 10 scoops each. Mary has 3 cartons of ice cream, one chocolate, one strawberry and one vanilla. Ethan wants one scoop of vanilla and one of chocolate. Lucas, Danny and Connor all want 2 scoops of chocolate. Olivia would like a scoop of vanilla and one of strawberry. Shannon wants twice as much as Olivia. How many scoops of ice cream will be left?
[Answer]The total number of scoops of ice cream that Mary has is 3 cartons * 10 scoops = 30 scoops of ice cream. Lucas, Danny and Connor will eat 2 scoops * 3 people = 6 scoops of ice cream. Shannon will eat 2 * (1 vanilla + 1 strawberry) = 4 total scoops of ice cream. Combined the kids will eat a total of 2 + 6 + 2 + 4 scoops = 14 scoops of ice cream. Mary will have 30 scoops - 14 scoops = 16 scoops of ice cream remaining. The answer is 16.

Q: Andrew is having two of his friends over for a sleepover. For one friend, Brian, he asks his mother to buy 3 donuts. He asks for his other friend, Samuel, to get the same. A day before the sleepover Andrew ends up inviting two more friends and asks his mother to buy them the same amount of donuts. Just in case, Andrew’s mother wants to buy one more donut for each of Andrew’s friends. Andrew’s mother is going to buy the same amount of donuts for Andrew as everybody else. How many donuts will Andrew’s mother need to buy?
A: Andrew is having 4 friends over who will get 3 donuts each, 4 x 3 = 12 donuts total. Andrew’s mother wants to get 1 extra donut for each of Andrew’s friends, 3 donuts + 1 extra = 4 donuts for each of Andrew's friends. Andrew’s mother is buying 12 + 4 extra donuts for Andrew’s friends = 16 total donuts. Andrew’s mother is also going to get 3 + 1 extra donut for Andrew = 4 donuts. Andrew’s mother will need to buy 16 donuts for Andrew’s friends + 4 donuts for Andrew = 20 total donuts. The answer is 20.
