To accomplish this goal of bending strips of metal that are too strong to bend by hand, several methods can be employed. The effectiveness of each method depends on various factors, such as the type of metal, the desired bend angle, and the tools available. Below, I will detail a few methods and analyze their sensibility when it comes to bending strong metal strips.

1. Using a Bench Vise and a Metal Pipe:
One of the simplest and most affordable methods is to use a bench vise and a metal pipe (also known as a cheater bar). Bench vises provide a stable clamping surface to hold the metal strip in place while the metal pipe serves as a lever to amplify the force applied.

First, secure the metal strip in the vise with the desired bend location positioned at the edge of the vise jaws. Then, slide the metal pipe over the free end of the strip. Apply downward pressure on the pipe to create a controlled bend in the strip using leverage. This method is sensible for occasional bending tasks, where precise angles are not required.

2. Hydraulic Press Brake:
A hydraulic press brake is an industrial-grade machine used specifically for bending metal. It operates using a hydraulic cylinder that applies pressure onto a die, which then bends the metal strip. The amount of pressure exerted can be adjusted based on the thickness and strength of the metal. Press brakes can also accommodate various die shapes to create specific bends.

This method provides greater control and precision but comes with a much higher cost. It is more sensible for facilities that require frequent metal bending with a high degree of accuracy.

3. Induction Bending:
Induction bending is a process in which heat is applied to the area of the metal strip where bending is desired. This is typically done using an induction coil that generates an electromagnetic field to heat the strip, making it more pliable. Once the desired temperature is reached, bending pressure is applied, allowing for smooth bends without leaving marks or damaging the metal strip.

Induction bending is a sensible method for projects that require high-quality bends with minimal stress or deformation on the metal. However, it necessitates specialized equipment and trained personnel, making it less practical for smaller projects or occasional bending tasks.

4. Sheet Metal Brake:
A sheet metal brake is a hand-operated tool designed to bend metal sheets or strips. It consists of a clamping bar that holds the metal in place and a bending plate that shapes the metal when pressure is applied.

Sheet metal brakes are available in various sizes and capacities, with some models capable of handling thick, strong metal strips. This method is sensible for projects that require numerous bends or specific bend angles, as it offers precise control and repeatability. Additionally, it is more affordable than hydraulic presses or induction bending equipment.

In conclusion, selecting the most sensible method to accomplish the goal of bending strong metal strips depends on several factors. For occasional or small-scale projects, using a bench vise and a metal pipe or a sheet metal brake may be the most appropriate choice. For larger projects or specialized bend requirements, a hydraulic press brake or induction bending may be more suitable. Ultimately, the method chosen should balance factors such as cost, precision, frequency of use, and the specific properties of the metal strips being bent.
