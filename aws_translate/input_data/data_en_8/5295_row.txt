Question: A family has three adults and children, both girls and boys. They went out for a family trip and prepared 3 dozen boiled eggs for the trip. Every adult got 3 eggs, and the boys each received 1 more egg than each girl since the girls had some snacks. How many boys went on the trip if the number of girls was 7 and each girl received an egg?
Answer: The total number of eggs the family had is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs. If each adult received 3 eggs, the total number of eggs they got is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. The children shared 36 - 9 = 27 eggs. Since each girl received an egg, the boys shared 27 - 7 = 20 eggs. If each boy received 1 egg more than each girl, each received 1 + 1 = 2 eggs. The boys received 20 eggs, and if each got 2 eggs, then 20 / 2 = 10 boys went on the trip. The answer is 10.
[Question]John is holding a poker night with his friends and is getting the decks of cards ready before his friends show up. After losing so many cards from various decks, John thinks he needs to count exactly how many cards he has to make sure he has enough full decks for the night. Each deck of cards should hold 52 cards. He finds 3 half-full decks of cards and 3 full decks of cards. As he is arranging them, he realizes that the quality of a lot of the cards is quite poor and decides to throw 34 of the cards in the trash. How many cards does John now have?
[Answer]In the full decks, John has a total of 52 cards in a full deck of cards * 3 full decks of cards = 156 cards. A half - full deck of cards contains 52 cards in a full deck of cards / 2 = 26 cards. So from the half - full decks, John has a total of 26 cards * 3 half - full decks = 78 cards. This is a total of 156 cards from full decks + 78 cards from half - full decks = 234 cards. After throwing some in the trash, he now holds a total of 234 cards - 34 trashed cards = 200 cards. The answer is 200.

[Question]Some students want to buy pencils from a stationery shop. The price of one pencil is 20 cents. Tolu wants 3 pencils, Robert wants 5 pencils and Melissa wants 2 pencils. How much (in dollars) will the students spend altogether at the stationery shop?
[Answer]The three students want a total of 3 + 2 + 5 = 10 pencils. Each pencil cost 20 cents so 10 pencils cost 20 * 10 = 200 cents. 100 cents make a dollar so 200 cents make 200 / 100 = 2 dollars. The answer is 2.
