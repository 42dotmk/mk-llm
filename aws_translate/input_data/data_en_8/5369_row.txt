Q: Carolyn practices the piano for 20 minutes a day and the violin for three times as long. If she practice six days a week, how many minutes does she spend practicing in a month with four weeks?
A: First find Carolyn's total violin practice time by tripling her piano practice time: 20 minutes / day * 3 = 60 minutes / day. Then find the total amount of time she spends practicing each day: 60 minutes / day + 20 minutes / day = 80 minutes / day. Then find the total time she spends practicing each week: 80 minutes / day * 6 days / week = 480 minutes / week. Then find the total time she spends practicing each month: 480 minutes / week * 4 weeks / month = 1920 minutes / month. The answer is 1920.
Question: Ellie went to visit a circus with Sarah and they both got lost in the house of mirrors. They have to travel through the house of mirrors a few times before they finally get out and when they leave, they discuss how many times they've seen their own reflections. Sarah says that every time they were in the room with tall mirrors, she saw her reflection 10 times and every time they were in the room with wide mirrors, she saw her reflection 5 times. Ellie says that every time they were in the room with tall mirrors, she saw her reflection 6 times and every time they were in the room with wide mirrors she saw her reflection 3 times. They both passed through the room with tall mirrors 3 times each and they both passed through the room with wide mirrors 5 times each. In total, how many times did Sarah and Ellie see their reflections?
Answer: In the rooms with tall mirrors, Sarah saw her reflection a total of 10 reflections * 3 passes = 30 times. In the rooms with wide mirrors, Sarah saw her reflection a total of 5 reflections * 5 passes = 25 reflections. So Sarah saw her reflection a total of 30 + 25 = 55 times. In the rooms with tall mirrors, Ellie saw her reflection a total of 6 reflections * 3 passes = 18 times. In the rooms with wide mirrors, Ellie saw her reflection a total of 3 reflections * 5 passes = 15 times. So Ellie saw her reflection a total of 18 + 15 = 33 times. Therefore, Sarah and Ellie saw their reflections a total of 55 + 33 = 88 times. The answer is 88.
[Question]There are six chairs in each row in a church. If there are 20 rows of chairs in the church, and each chair holds five people, calculate the number of people who have to sit in the chairs for the church to be full.
[Answer]If there are six chairs in each row in the church, the total number of chairs in the church is 6 * 20 = 120. Since each chair holds 5 people, 5 * 120 = 600 people must sit in all of the chairs for the church to be full. The answer is 600.
