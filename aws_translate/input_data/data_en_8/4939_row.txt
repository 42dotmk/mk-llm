Dublin, Ireland (CNN) -- Ireland and the European Union are engaged in a strange and increasingly public tug of war. Dublin has been adamant that it doesn't need money from abroad to stay afloat despite a crisis in its banking sector. However, the republic's central bank governor admitted Thursday that the country was likely to accept a loan from the European Union and International Monetary Fund. Speaking on the phone from Frankfurt, Ireland's Central Bank governor Patrick Honohan told Irish broadcaster RTE that a loan worth "tens of billions of euros" is "definitely likely to happen." "Market conditions have not allowed us to go ahead without seeking the support of our international collaborators so that is what's ahead," he said, ahead of high-level talks between the Irish government and the IMF and ECB talks in Dublin Thursday.
