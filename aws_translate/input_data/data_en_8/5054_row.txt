Step 1: Establish the genre and setting
To begin with, it's important to decide what kind of movie we are aiming to create. In this case, let's choose a mystery thriller set in the late 2010s. The movie will take place in a busy metropolitan city, where Spencer and Henry both work at a successful tech company.

Step 2: Develop the main characters
Spencer is a talented software engineer but somewhat introverted and reserved. He's followed his passion for technology throughout his life and tends to focus on work more than his personal relationships, making his friendship with Henry unique and valuable.

Henry, on the other hand, is an outgoing sales representative at the same tech company. He has a natural charisma that helps him form connections easily with clients. Despite their differing personalities, Spencer and Henry have forged a close bond over the years due to a shared love for technology and their sense of humor.

Step 3: Introduce the central conflict
The plot begins when a valuable piece of unreleased software goes missing from the company's secure database. The higher-ups suspect an insider was responsible for the theft and hire a private investigator to track down the culprit. Tensions rise in the workplace as suspicions mount, putting Spencer and Henry's friendship to the test.

Step 4: Add subplots and secondary characters
As the investigation progresses, several subplots emerge, such as:

1. Spencer's burgeoning romantic relationship with a fellow software engineer, which begins to grow strained due to the mounting pressure at work.

2. Henry's family life. He is married with two young children, and the financial repercussions of possibly losing his job due to the investigation put a strain on his household.

3. The private investigator, Cassandra, who has her own motivations for solving the case. She is using the investigation to prove her worth to secure a promotion within her agency.

Step 5: Reach the climax
As the movie reaches its climax, it is revealed that it was actually a competing company that infiltrated the secure database with the aid of an unsuspecting insider, who was manipulated by the rival company. The mole turns out to be someone Spencer and Henry least suspectâ€”a trusted coworker who was struggling financially and saw no other way out.

Step 6: Resolve the story
With the truth revealed, the trust between Spencer and Henry is restored, and their friendship becomes even stronger. Spencer and his romantic interest overcome their difficulties and commit to better communication. Henry decides to focus more on his family's needs and reassesses his priorities. The outcome of the investigation leads to the rival company facing severe consequences for their corporate espionage.

Step 7: Conclude by setting up potential sequel
In the final moments of the movie, the audience gets a hint that there may be other corporate espionage activities happening within the tech industry, possibly setting up for a sequel in which Spencer, Henry, and Cassandra team up to expose and take down these illegal practices.

In summary, the movie starts with the introduction of Spencer and Henry, their jobs, friendship, and personal struggles. It evolves into a thrilling and suspenseful mystery with unforeseen twists and turns, culminating in the restoration of trust and the strengthening of their friendship. Along the way, subplots and secondary characters add depth and complexity to the overall story.
