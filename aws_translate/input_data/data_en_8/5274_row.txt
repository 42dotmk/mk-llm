To accomplish the goal of poking holes in polymer clay beads before they're baked, you will need to follow a series of specific steps. Below is a detailed guide to help you:

1. Gather the necessary tools and materials:
  - Polymer clay (in the desired colors)
  - Round bead- or lentil-shape maker (optional)
  - Needle, toothpick, or bead-piercing tool
  - Cornstarch or water (to prevent clay from sticking)
  - Flat working surface
  - Wax paper or plastic sheet (to prevent clay from staining your work surface)
  - Oven-safe baking sheet or glass (for baking)
  - Oven or toaster oven (for baking)

2. Prepare your work area: 
  - Place your flat working surface, such as a cutting board or table, in a well-lit area. 
  - Lay down wax paper or a plastic sheet to prevent the clay from adhering to your work surface. 
  - Preheat your oven or toaster oven according to the polymer clay manufacturer's instructions.

3. Condition the clay: 
  - Before shaping the beads, you will need to soften and condition the polymer clay by kneading it with your hands or running it through a pasta machine a few times. This step is crucial for achieving a uniform consistency, which will result in better quality beads.

4. Shape the beads: 
  - Using the conditioned clay, shape your beads by rolling small portions of the clay into rounds or lentil shapes. You can use a round bead- or lentil-shape maker for more precise and uniform shapes. 
  - The size and shape of the beads are entirely customizable, depending on your preference or project requirements.

5. Poke the holes: 
  - Before you pierce the bead, decide on the orientation of the hole (horizontal or vertical in relation to the bead) by considering your final jewelry design. 
  - Lightly dust the needle, toothpick, or bead-piercing tool with cornstarch or dip it in water to prevent the clay from sticking to the tool. 
  - Gently press the needle or toothpick into the bead at the desired entry point. Rotate the tool as you push, maintaining a slow and steady pressure. This will help reduce distortion in the bead's shape. 
  - Carefully push the tool through until you feel it exit the other side. Pull the tool straight out, being mindful of the bead's shape.
  - Check the hole's size and adjust it by gently rotating the tool or using a larger tool, if necessary. 
  - If the bead's shape gets distorted, reshape it gently with your fingers, taking care not to close the hole.

6. Smooth the holes: 
  - For a polished look, smooth out the edges of the holes by gently rubbing your fingers around the entry and exit points or using a small, clean brush.

7. Bake the beads: 
  - Place the beads on an oven-safe baking sheet or glass dish, ensuring that they don't touch each other to prevent melting. 
  - Bake the polymer clay beads according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually around 250-275°F (120-135°C) for 15 to 30 minutes. Baking time may vary depending on the thickness of the beads.
  - After baking, remove the beads from the oven and allow them to cool completely before handling.

8. Finish and use the beads: 
  - Your polymer clay beads are now ready to be used in your jewelry-making projects. If desired, you can further embellish them with paint, varnish, or other finishes to create unique, eye-catching pieces.

By following these steps, you'll be able to create beautiful and evenly-shaped polymer clay beads with securely poked holes, ready for various applications and craft projects.
