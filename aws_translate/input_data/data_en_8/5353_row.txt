The ancient Roman festival that you are referring to is called Saturnalia, which ran until the 4th century AD and involved sacrifices, partying, owners serving their slaves, and was partly subsumed into Christmas. This festival was celebrated in honor of the Roman deity Saturn, who was the god of agriculture, wealth, renewal, and liberation. The main purpose of the event was to commemorate the end of the agricultural year and to symbolize the renewal of life. Saturnalia was a time of merriment and joy, with Roman citizens indulging in feasting, gift-giving, and various forms of entertainment.

The festival typically commenced on December 17th, and the celebration would last for a week, until December 23rd. Originally, Saturnalia was observed for only a day or two, but as its popularity grew throughout the Roman Empire, the duration was increased accordingly. The celebrations featured a number of unique customs and rituals specific to the event.

One of the key aspects of the festivities involved the social reversal of roles, where slaves were given a temporary reprieve from their usual duties and were allowed to participate in the revelries. During the festival, slaves were treated as equals â€“ they were permitted to wear the same clothes as their masters, and in some cases, the roles were reversed, with the masters serving meals to their slaves. This exchange of roles symbolized the god Saturn's overturning of the social order, promoting equality and a sense of camaraderie among all members of society.

Another important feature of Saturnalia was the ritual of gift-giving, which took the form of small tokens called sigillaria, often made from terracotta, wax, or clay. These miniature, often humorous, figurines represented a variety of characters, professions, or themes, and were exchanged among family members and friends. Other popular gifts during this time included candles, which symbolized the solstice's return of light, and edible treats like honey, fruits, and nuts.

The celebrations also involved an abundance of food and drink. Feasting was an essential part of Saturnalia since it was a time of indulgence and merriment. Public banquets were held, and large quantities of wine were consumed to add to the festive atmosphere. In addition to the feasting, various forms of entertainment were organized, such as music, poetry recitals, and theatrical performances.

As the Roman Empire converted to Christianity around the 4th century AD, many of the traditions and customs of Saturnalia were subsumed into the Christian celebration of Christmas. The idea of exchanging gifts, indulging in grand feasts, and celebrating with merriment during the festive season can all be traced back to the original Saturnalia festival. Additionally, the choosing of December 25th as the date to celebrate the birth of Jesus has been suggested to be influenced by the proximity of Saturnalia, thereby assimilating the revered aspects and traditions of the pagan celebration into the Christian observance of Christmas.

In conclusion, Saturnalia was an ancient Roman festival that provided an opportunity for social role reversals, indulgence in food and wine, public entertainment, and the exchange of gifts. The celebration of Christmas adopted many of these customs, with the two events becoming partially entwined in history. As such, the jollity and communal aspects of modern Christmas festivities are, in part, a legacy of the ancient Roman festival of Saturnalia.
