Though the sentence "Darwin and Wallace made variation among individuals of the same species central to understanding the natural world" touches upon one of the ideas in Darwin's theory on variation, it does not completely answer the question "What does Darwin theorize about different species with regard to variety?"

To provide a long and detailed answer to the question, we need to delve deeper into Charles Darwin's thoughts and theories. In particular, his most famous work, "On the Origin of Species," where Darwin presents his theory of evolution by natural selection as an explanation for the variety and diversity of species.

Darwin observed that within given populations, no two individuals are exactly alike; there is always some variation among individuals. This observation laid the groundwork for his theory of evolution, as it recognizes the importance of variety in shaping the natural world.

Darwin emphasized that the variety among individuals within a species is essential for a species to survive and adapt to changing environmental conditions. According to his theory, the traits that are beneficial for survival and reproduction will become more common in the population over time, while traits that are less beneficial, or even detrimental, will become less common. This process of selection leads to the formation of new species and the extinction of others.

Further, Darwin theorized that this variety arises from several sources:

1. Sexual reproduction: Two parents contribute genetic material to the offspring, resulting in a unique combination of genes that produces different traits in individuals.

2. Mutation: Changes in DNA sequences lead to new traits or variations in existing traits, some of which may be beneficial, neutral, or harmful to the organism.

3. Genetic recombination: During the process of reproduction, the genetic material from each parent gets recombined in various ways, which can lead to new combinations of traits in offspring.

4. Gene flow: The movement of individuals and their genes between populations can introduce new genetic variation.

Although Darwin did not have a complete understanding of genetics and heredity at his time, it is interesting to note that his theories foreshadowed many modern concepts in biology. In fact, his work paved the way for the modern theory of evolution called the "Modern Synthesis," which combines Darwin's natural selection concepts with Mendelian genetics.

Alfred Russel Wallace, a naturalist and biologist, independently came to similar conclusions as Darwin about natural selection, which is why both names are mentioned in the sentence. However, Darwin's contributions are more widely recognized because he articulated his theory more comprehensively in his writings.

In conclusion, while the sentence given highlights the importance of variety for understanding the natural world, Darwin's theory of evolution goes beyond examining variations among individuals within the same species. It explains how new species arise from these variations and how the process of natural selection acts on them. To answer the question "What does Darwin theorize about different species with regard to variety?" fully, one should emphasize the significance of variation among individuals, the sources of this variety, and how natural selection acting on these variations results in the evolution of species and the immense diversity of life forms that we observe today.
