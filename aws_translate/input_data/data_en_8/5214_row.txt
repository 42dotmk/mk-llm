II] Ben chose the suburb because it was lightly populated in traffic.

Growing up in the hustle and bustle of the city, Ben had been exposed to noisy streets, polluted air, and overcrowded roads for as long as he could remember. As an introvert, he craved the serenity of a peaceful environment. This desire led him to research new towns and areas to relocate to. In his research, he discovered a charming suburb only an hour's drive from the city where he worked. With vast green spaces, an excellent school district, and considerably less traffic, it seemed like the perfect escape from the metropolitan chaos.

Once he had made up his mind to relocate there, Ben began searching for a suitable house. He sought the help of a local real estate agent who provided him a list of available properties. After viewing a few moderately sized houses surrounded by beautiful gardens and friendly neighbors, he settled on one that felt like it could become a true home. A two-story, three-bedroom house with an inviting front porch and a spacious backyard, perfect for gardening and hosting family barbecues.

Ben cherished his weekends spent exploring the new area: bicycling along peaceful lanes framed by towering oak trees, stopping by the local farmers' market to pick up fresh produce, and even joining an amateur gardening group to connect with like-minded individuals. Being able to inhale the fresh air and enjoy the sight of children playing safely in their front yards brought immeasurable joy to Ben's heart.

The most significant positive change, however, was the noticeable decline in traffic. With fewer cars populating the streets and less air pollution clouding the skies, Ben's overall quality of life improved. The shorter commute to work meant less stress and more free time to pursue his hobbies, like jogging along the scenic suburban trails and picking up landscape photography as a creative outlet. The tranquility of the area was soul-soothing and allowed him to recharge his batteries after work, away from the constant distractions of city living.

Living in the suburb also offered a great opportunity for Ben to be more involved in his community. The tight-knit neighborhoods welcomed him with open arms, inviting him to participate in local events and helping him build lasting connections. From volunteering at the community library to organizing charity bake sales, Ben found a sense of belonging in his new surroundings.

As the years passed, Ben's love for his suburban oasis continued to deepen. He eventually married and had children, and the suburb proved to be an excellent place for them to grow up. Access to excellent schools, sports clubs, and various extracurricular activities allowed his children to create lasting memories and enrich their lives.

Of course, Ben never entirely gave up his connection to the city. His job still required him to commute, and he visited friends and family who remained there. But the relief of returning to the serene suburb after a long workday in the city reinforced his belief that he had made the right choice.

In choosing a less congested life over the crowded city, Ben discovered greater happiness and rejuvenation in the calm and friendly suburb. It offered him tranquility, improved his well-being, and allowed him to enjoy his life in a way he had never been able to before. The suburb, once a distant unknown, became the sanctuary he never knew he needed, and a place where he could truly call home.
