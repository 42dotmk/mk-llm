Q: Darnell has 1000 square feet of fabric that he's using to make mini flags. He makes square flags that are 4 feet by 4 feet, wide rectangular flags that are 5 feet by 3 feet, and tall rectangular flags that are 3 feet by 5 feet. He has already made 16 square flags, 20 wide flags, and 10 tall flags. How many square feet of fabric does he have left?
A: The square flags use 16 square feet of fabric per flag because four times four equals 16. The wide flags each use 15 feet of fabric per flag because five times three equals 15. The tall flags each use 15 feet of fabric per flag because five times three equals 15. He has used 256 square feet for the square flags because 16 times 16 equals 256. He has used 300 square feet for the wide flags because 20 times 15 equals 300. He has used 150 square feet for the tall flags because ten times 15 equals 150. He has used 706 square feet because 256 plus 300 plus 150 equals 706. He has 294 square feet left because 1,000 minus 706 equals 294. The answer is 294.
Question: Terry's mom brought home 4 different colored dogs from the shelter. The brown dog weighs 4 pounds. The black dog weighs 1 pound more than the brown dog. The white dog weighs twice as much as the brown dog. The grey dog weighs 2 pounds less than the black dog. What's the average weight of all the dogs?
Answer: Since the black dog weighs 1 pound more than the brown dog, the black dog weighs 1 + 4 = 5 pounds. The white dog weighs 4 * 2 = 8 pounds. Because the grey dog weighs 2 pounds less than the black dog, the grey dog weighs 5 - 2 = 3 pounds. The total weight of all dogs is 4 + 5 + 8 + 3 = 20 pounds. The average weight of all the dogs is 20 / 4 = 5 pounds. The answer is 5.
[Question]William washes cars as a side job. He typically spends 4 minutes washing a carâ€™s windows, 7 minutes washing the car body, 4 minutes cleaning the tires, and 9 minutes waxing the car. This morning he washed 2 normal cars and one big SUV, which took twice as long as a normal car. How many minutes did William spend washing all the vehicles?
[Answer]William spends 4 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 24 minutes washing a normal car. He washed 2 normal cars, so he spent 24 * 2 = 48 minutes on the normal cars. He took twice as long as one car for the SUV, so he took 24 * 2 = 48 minutes on the SUV. Thus, William spent 48 + 48 = 96 minutes washing all the vehicles. The answer is 96.

A: Between Monday and Wednesday, she spends 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 3 hours. That means she has 5 hours - 3 hours = 2 hours left for Tuesday and Wednesday. She spends 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour on Friday. The answer is 1.
