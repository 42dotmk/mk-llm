Reasoning and answer: Marvin sold 35 candy bars at $2 each so 35 * 2 = $70 worth of candy. Tina sold three times the amount of candy so $70 * 3 = $210 worth of candy. If Tina sold $210 worth of candy and Marvin sold $70 in candy then 210 - 70 = $140 more sold than Marvin.
The answer: 140

Earl was on the 1 + 5 = 6th floor after going up 5 floors. When he went down 2 floors, he was on the 6 - 2 = 4th floor. Since he went up 7 floors, he was then on the 4 + 7 = 11th floor. Since he is 9 floors away from the top of the building, therefore the building has 11 + 9 = 20 floors.
The answer: 20
Reverse engineering the question: Earl started delivering newspapers on the first floor of a condominium building. He then went up 5 floors then went down 2 floors. He again went up 7 floors and found that he is 9 floors away from the top of the building. How many floors does the building have?

Reasoning and answer: Since a year has 365 days, the total television production in the first year is 10 * 365 = 3650. In the second year, they reduced the total television production by 10 / 100 * 3650 = 365. The total television production in the second year was 3650 - 365 = 3285.
The answer: 3285

He writes each friend 3 * 2 = 6 pages a week. So he writes 6 * 2 = 12 pages every week. That means he writes 12 * 52 = 624 pages a year.
The answer: 624
Reverse engineering the question: James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week. How many pages does he write a year?

Reasoning and answer: She burnt 2 dozen, cooked 2 dozen and then another 2 dozen that evening. So she made 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 dozen cupcakes. Each dozen makes 12 cupcakes, so she made 6 * 12 = 72 cupcakes. She threw away 2 dozen cupcakes, so 2 * 12 = 24 cupcakes. She made 72, threw away 24, ate 5 and then ate another 4 so she had 72 - 24 - 5 - 4 = 39 cupcakes left. She sells the 39 cupcakes at $2.00 each so she earned 39 * 2 = $78.00. She made 72 cupcakes at a cost of $0.75 each for a total cost of 72 * $0.75 = $54.00. If she made $78 on the remaining cupcakes and it cost her $54.00 to make all of the cupcakes then her profit is $78 - $54 = $24.00.
The answer: 24

Question: Prudence was starting a cupcake business. She figured that each cupcake cost $0.75 to make. The first 2 dozen that she made burnt and she had to throw them out. The next 2 came out perfectly and she ended up eating 5 cupcakes right away. Later that day she made 2 more dozen cupcakes and decided to eat 4 more. If she sells the remaining cupcakes at $2.00 each, how much is her net profit?

Reasoning and answer: If Coco used his oven 25 hours last month and its energy consumption is 2.4 kW per hour, then we consumed a total of 25 * 2.4 = 60 kW on his oven last month. If the price of electricity is $0.10 per kW, then 60 kW would cost = $0.10 * 60 = $6.
The answer: 6
