U.S. Vice President Mike Pence visited Jordan in January 2018, a month after the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a decision which infuriated Palestinians. Pence’s visit aimed to rebuild trust in the possibility of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which had been undermined following the Trump administration's controversial Jerusalem decision. According to reports, Pence reassured King Abdullah of Jordan that the U.S. was committed to restarting peace efforts and supporting a two-state solution, but only if both parties agree. This represented a significant shift from the long-standing U.S. position of unequivocally supporting the two-state solution as the only outcome to the conflict.

The Jerusalem decision had significant implications not just for Palestinians, but also for Jordan. Jerusalem is considered an emotional centerpiece of the long-standing conflict, stirring protests and condemnation across Arab and Muslim countries. King Abdullah, a staunch U.S. ally, derives his political legitimacy partly from the Hashemite dynasty's role as the guardian of a key Muslim site in Jerusalem. Therefore, any perceived threat towards Muslim claims in Jerusalem is seen as a challenge to Jordan, which is home to a large Palestinian-origin population.

Other key concerns for Jordan included Trump administration's plan to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a move that the Kingdom opposed if taken ahead of an Israeli-Palestinian partition deal. This decision faced international opposition, as it broke with the consensus that the city's final status should be decided through negotiations. 

Pence’s visit was marked by robust discussions with King Abdullah, including a "very frank discussion" regarding their disagreements over U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Despite their differences, both leaders agreed on the importance of resuming peace talks. Pence expressed hope that his visit will reignite the peace process, demonstrating the U.S.'s commitment to respect Jordan's role as the custodian of holy sites and remaining neutral on the issues of boundaries and final status.

The Jerusalem decision also led to severe backlash from Palestinian authorities. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas refused to meet Trump administration officials, canceled a scheduled meeting with Pence, and publicly stated that the U.S. can no longer serve as a mediator. In response to these developments, Abbas sought to increase European Union involvement in mediation efforts and is urging EU member states to recognize Palestine as a state based on the pre-1967 lines.

Throughout his trip, Pence, who referred to the U.S. as Israel's greatest friend, reaffirmed the U.S.'s commitment to peace in the region. He maintained the view that any refusal to engage with America over peace signifies an unwillingness towards peace. Pence’s tour concluded with visits to the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial and a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Overall, Pence's visit to Jordan in 2018 underlined the complexity of U.S. relationships in the region following the controversial decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Although intended to rebuild trust, it showcased deep-seated disagreement and concern from key regional actors such as Jordan and the Palestinians about the U.S.'s role in peace negotiations and the future of the two-state solution.
