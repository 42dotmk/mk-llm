[Question]John hits 70% of his free throws. For every foul he gets 2 shots. He gets fouled 5 times a game. How many free throws does he get if he plays in 80% of the 20 games the team plays?
[Answer]John plays in 20 * .8 = 16 games. That means he gets fouled 16 * 5 = 80 fouls. So he gets 80 * 2 = 160 foul shots. So he makes 160 * .7 = 112 free throws. The answer is 112.
Q: Tonya has opened a lemonade stand selling lemonade in small, medium, and large cups at $1, $2 and $3 respectively. At the close of business she ended up making $50. As she went back through her inventory she noticed that she sold $11 worth of small lemonades and $24 worth of medium lemonades. How many cups of large lemonade did Tonya sell?
A: 1. Tonya sold $11 worth of small lemonades and $24 worth of medium lemonades which makes $11 + $24 = $35 for small and medium lemonades. 2. Tonya made a total of $50. If she made $35 selling the two smaller sizes and she sold three sizes in all then $50 - $35 = $15 worth of large lemonades. 3. The large lemonades sold for $3 each and Tonya sold $15 worth of large lemonades which means she sold $15 / $3 = 5 large cups of lemonade. The answer is 5.
Question: Maddie wants to see how much her mom spends on coffee each week. She makes herself 2 cups of coffee per day. Each cup has 1.5 ounces of coffee beans. A bag of coffee costs $8 and contains 10.5 ounces of beans. She uses 1/2 a gallon of milk per week. A gallon of milk costs $4. She doesn't add any sugar to the coffee. How much does she spend on her coffee per week?
Answer: She uses 3 ounces of beans per day because 2 x 1.5 = 3. She uses 21 ounces of beans per week because 7 x 3 = 21. She buys 2 bags of beans per week because 21 / 10.5 = 2. She spends $16 on the beans per week because 2 x 8 = 16. She spends $2 on the milk per week because 4 x (1 / 2) = 2. She spends $18 per week on her coffee because 16 + 2 = 18. The answer is 18.
[Question]Ms. Estrella is an entrepreneur with a startup company having 10 employees. The company makes a revenue of $400000 a month, paying 10% in taxes, 5% of the remaining amount on marketing and ads, 20% of the remaining amount on operational costs, and 15% of the remaining amount on employee wages. Assuming each employee receives the same wage, calculate the amount of money each employee is paid monthly.
[Answer]The company pays a total of 10 / 100 * $400000 = $40000 on taxes. After taxes, the company revenue is $400000 - $40000 = $360,000. The costs of marketing and ads campaign are 5 / 100 * $360000 = $18000. After deducting the costs of marketing and adds campaign, the company remains with = $342,000 in revenue. Operational costs for the company are 20 / 100 * $342000 = $68400. After taking out the operational costs, the company remains with $342000 - $68400 = $273600. The company also pays employee wages of 15 / 100 * $273600 = $41040. If the total number of employees is 10, each employee is paid a salary of $41040 / 10 = $4104 per month. The answer is 4104.
