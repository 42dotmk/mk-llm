[Question]A local bookshop is selling off its old inventory in order to bring in newer books. They currently have 743 books in their store. They sold 37 books in-store on Saturday and sold 128 books online. On Sunday, they sold twice as many books in-store and increased their online sales by 34 books. They also received a shipment of 160 books. How many books do they currently have?
[Answer]On Sunday they sold twice as many books in - store as the 37 books on Saturday so they sold 2 * 37 = 74. They sold 128 books online on Saturday and increased that number by 34 books on Sunday for a total of 128 + 34 = 162. Over the weekend they sold 37 + 128 + 74 + 162 = 401 books. They started off with 743 books and sold 401 books which brings the inventory to 743 - 401 = 342 books. They have 342 books and received a shipment for 160 bringing their inventory to 342 + 160 = 502 books. The answer is 502.
Q: A papaya tree will grow 2 feet in the first year. In the second year, it will grow 50% more than the first year. In the third year, the tree will grow 50% more than in the second year. In the fourth year, it will grow twice as much as the third year. In the fifth year, it will grow half as much as the fourth year. When the tree is 5 years old, how tall is the tree?
A: In the second year, the tree will grow 2 x 1.5 = 3 feet. In the third year, it will grow 3 x 1.5 = 4.5 feet. In the fourth year, it will grow 4.5 x 2 = 9 feet. In the fifth year, it will grow 9 / 2 = 4.5 feet. When the tree is 5 years old, including the first year's growth, it will be this tall 2 + 3 + 4.5 + 9 + 4.5 = 23 feet. The answer is 23.
Question: Mabel is counting sharks in the ocean. She knows that of the fish that she sees, 25% will be sharks and 75% will be another type of fish. On day one she counts 15 fish. On day 2 she counts three times as many. How many sharks did she count over those two days?
Answer: She counts 45 fish on day 2 because 3 x 15 = 45. She counts 60 fish in total because 15 + 45 = 60. She counts 15 sharks because 60 x .25 = 15. The answer is 15.
[Question]Six more than twice as many ducks go to North Pond as go to Lake Michigan. If Lake Michigan has 100 ducks, how many ducks can you safely estimate there will be at North Pond?
[Answer]To determine the number of ducks at North Pond, we must first perform 100 * 2 = 200 to find the number to add 6 ducks to. We then take this number and add 6 to it, performing 200 + 6 = 206 ducks in total at North Pond. The answer is 206.
Q: John decides to go back to school to get his PhD. He first takes 1 year of courses to get acclimated back to school life before starting his PhD. After that, he spends 2 years learning the basics of his field. He then starts research, and he spends 75% more time on research than he did learning the basics. He then spends half as long on writing his dissertation as his acclimation period. How long did it take him to do everything?
A: It took him 2 * .75 = 1.5 years longer to do his research than it took to learn the basics. So it took him a total of 2 + 1.5 = 3.5 years to do research. His dissertation took 1 / 2 = .5 years to write. So everything together took 1 + 2 + 3.5 + .5 = 7 years. The answer is 7.
