Q: Mr. Manuel is a campsite manager who's been tasked with checking the number of tents set up in the recreation area. On a particular day, he counted 100 tents in the northernmost part of the campsite and twice that number on the east side of the grounds. The number of tents at the center of the camp was four times the number of tents in the northernmost part of the campsite. If he also counted 200 tents in the southern part of the campsite, what is the total number of tents in the recreation area?
A: On the eastern part of the campsite, Mr Manuel counted 2 * 100 = 200 tents. The total number of tents in the eastern and the northern part of the campgrounds is 200 + 100 = 300. There are four times as many tents as the northernmost part in the central part of the campsite, which means there are 4 * 100 = 400 tents in the central part of the camp. The total number of tents in the three parts of the campsite is 400 + 300 = 700. If you add the number of tents Mr. Manuel counted at the southern part of the campsite, you get 700 + 200 = 900 tents on the whole campsite. The answer is 900.
Question: Jack leaves his bathtub's faucet dripping at a rate of 40 ml/minute. Water evaporates from the bathtub at a rate of 200 ml/hour. If he leaves the water running for 9 hours, then dumps out 12 liters, how many milliliters of water are left in the bathtub?
Answer: First find how much water fills the bathtub per hour: 40 ml / minute * 60 minutes / hour = 2400 ml / hour. Then subtract the water that evaporates to find the total amount of water added per hour: 2400 ml / hour - 200 ml / hour = 2200 ml / hour. Then multiply that amount by the number of hours to find the total amount of water in the tub: 2200 ml / hour * 9 hours = 19800 ml. Then find the number of milliliters in 12 liters: 12 liters * 1000 ml / liter = 12000 ml. Then subtract the water Jack removes from the total amount of water to find the remaining amount of water: 19800 ml - 12000 ml = 7800 ml. The answer is 7800.
