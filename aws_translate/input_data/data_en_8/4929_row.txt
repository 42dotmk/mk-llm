No, I don't think that "pollen" is the right answer to the question "what is more complex in eukaryotes than prokaryotes?" given that mitosis is more complex in eukaryotes than prokaryotes. To answer this question more accurately, we should explore the differences between eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and discuss some key features that make eukaryotes more complex.

Eukaryotes and prokaryotes are two distinct categories of organisms, with the main difference between them being the presence or absence of a distinct nucleus in their cells. Eukaryotic cells, found in animals, plants, fungi, and protists, have a nucleus enclosed by a nuclear membrane that houses the DNA. On the other hand, prokaryotic cells, found in bacteria and archaea, lack a distinct nucleus, and their DNA is contained within a nucleoid region.

In light of the distinction mentioned above, several aspects of eukaryotes make them more complex than prokaryotes:

1. Mitosis: As you rightly pointed out, mitosis is more complex in eukaryotes than prokaryotes. Eukaryotic cells divide through a controlled process involving multiple phases such as prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, followed by cytokinesis. Prokaryotes divide by binary fission, which is a simpler process where the DNA replication and segregation of the cellular contents occur simultaneously.

2. Compartmentalization: Eukaryotic cells have various membrane-bound organelles, such as endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, chloroplasts (in plants), and lysosomes that compartmentalize the cell and participate in specific cellular functions. Prokaryotic cells, however, do not possess these membrane-bound organelles, and their metabolic processes occur within the cytoplasm or on the plasma membrane.

3. Genetic material: Eukaryotes possess linear DNA molecules with histone proteins to form chromatin, which can be further organized into chromosomes within the nucleus. They also have more genes than prokaryotes due to introns, which are non-coding sequences that allow for alternative splicing and gene expression regulation. In contrast, prokaryotes have circular DNA molecules and lack introns, encompassing a more compact genome.

4. Cytoplasmic organization: The eukaryotic cytoplasm exhibits a complex organization, including a cytoskeleton composed of actin filaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments that help maintain the cell's shape and facilitate intracellular transport. The prokaryotic cytoplasm lacks this level of organization and contains only a few homologous proteins to those found in eukaryotes.

5. Gene expression and regulation: Eukaryotic cells have more sophisticated mechanisms for gene expression regulation, such as transcription factors, chromatin remodeling, RNA splicing, and epigenetic modifications. Prokaryotic cells, on the other hand, primarily regulate gene expression at the level of transcription initiation through the use of operons, which are simpler in comparison.

In summary, several aspects make eukaryotes more complex than prokaryotes, such as mitosis, compartmentalization, genetic material organization, cytoplasmic organization, and gene expression regulation. Pollen, which is a structure found in seed plants, does not appropriately address the complexity differences between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Instead, the mentioned aspects better explain the complexity found in eukaryotic cells compared to prokaryotic cells.
