While the statement you provided does address the lack of cohesion among the sub-fields of anthropology, it does not specifically answer the question regarding the central questions that have occupied cultural and social anthropology. Allow me to provide a more detailed and comprehensive answer to your question.

Cultural and social anthropology are two closely related sub-fields within anthropology that focus on the study of human societies, their cultural practices, and the ways in which they interact with one another. Throughout the development of these sub-fields, several key questions and themes have emerged as central areas of focus. Some of these include:

1. The Nature of Culture: One of the foundational questions in cultural and social anthropology is understanding what constitutes a culture. This has led anthropologists to explore the various ways in which humans create and convey meaning through language, symbols, and social practices. Many anthropologists aim to document and compare various aspects of culture, such as beliefs, values, norms, and customs, to better understand the diversity of human societies.

2. Social Organization and Kinship: Another core area of interest for cultural and social anthropologists is the study of social organization and kinship systems. This includes investigating the ways in which humans form social groups and relationships, such as families, clans, tribes, and other social units. Anthropologists have sought to understand the various factors that influence the formation of these groups, as well as the roles they play in different societies.

3. Power and Hierarchy: Anthropologists are also interested in exploring the various ways in which power is distributed within societies, as well as how this power dynamics may shape social interactions and hierarchies. This can involve examining the roles of social institutions, such as governments, religions, and economic systems, and their impact on an individualâ€™s access to resources, status, and influence.

4. Cultural Change and Adaptation: As cultures and societies are dynamic and constantly evolving, another central question in cultural and social anthropology involves understanding the processes and factors that contribute to cultural change and adaptation. This can include the study of migration, globalization, and the ways in which societies respond to environmental challenges or new technologies.

5. Cultural Relativism and Ethnocentrism: A key challenge for anthropologists is overcoming their own cultural biases and approaching the study of other cultures from a neutral standpoint. This has led to the development of the concept of cultural relativism, which advocates for understanding each culture on its own terms, rather than comparing or judging it based on one's own cultural values. Addressing issues related to cultural relativism and ethnocentrism is crucial in conducting anthropological research and producing unbiased perspectives on different societies.

In conclusion, the central questions in cultural and social anthropology encompass a wide range of themes, such as the nature of culture, social organization, power dynamics, cultural change, and the importance of cultural relativism. While the statement you provided does touch upon the fragmentation of the sub-fields of anthropology, it does not specifically address these central questions that have occupied the study of cultural and social anthropology.
