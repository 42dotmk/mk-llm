Act 1:

In the late 1940s, Los Angeles, Roy Earle (played by Humphrey Bogart) is a notorious criminal known for his expert planning and execution of robberies. He has earned a level of infamy from both the media and the LAPD. Serving time in prison, Roy is unexpectedly granted parole after the intervention of a powerful crime boss, Jack "Big Mac" McIntyre (played by Edward G. Robinson). Roy assumed that his criminal past was behind him and struggles to cope with his newfound freedom.

While trying to adapt to his new life, Roy is taken under the wing of a fellow ex-convict Tony (played by Peter Lorre) who runs a small repair shop. Through his job, he meets the beautiful and young Marie Garson (played by Lauren Bacall), a single mother struggling to make ends meet. Marie, aware of Roy's past, is initially hesitant to develop a relationship but soon finds herself falling for him nonetheless.

Act 2:

Despite Roy's efforts to leave the criminal world behind, his past catches up to him when Big Mac reaches out with the offer of one final heist: the robbery of a prestigious casino in Las Vegas. Big Mac reveals that he has dirt on Roy's parole officer and can send him back to prison if he refuses his offer. Reluctantly, Roy agrees to participate in the heist, seeing it as an opportunity to secure financial stability for both himself and Marie.

Roy enlists the help of a team of skilled professionals, including his old friend Pete Harris (played by Elisha Cook Jr.) and a renowned explosives expert named Red (played by Barton MacLane). Together they meticulously plan the intricate heist, which involves navigating complex security measures and avoiding the ever-vigilant eyes of the casino owner, Paul Hendrickson (played by Raymond Massey). Throughout this period, Roy becomes increasingly torn between his devotion to Marie and his sense of obligation towards Big Mac.

Act 3:

After weeks of preparation, the day of the heist finally arrives. The team successfully infiltrates the casino, overcoming numerous obstacles. However, as they make their escape, an unforeseen complication arises when they discover that their initial escape plan has been compromised. With moments to spare, Roy quickly devises an alternative exit strategy, ensuring the team's successful evasion of the police.

The aftermath of the heist finds the team meeting up at a remote and abandoned warehouse to divide their loot. However, tensions quickly rise as paranoia and greed take hold, leading to a violent confrontation between Roy, Red and Pete. Ultimately, Roy emerges victorious, and he reunites with Marie to share the news of his success. They plan their future together, hoping for a fresh start.

However, news of the casino heist spreads quickly, and both the police and Hendrickson's henchmen close in on the perpetrators. In a climactic chase sequence, Roy and Marie are pursued through the streets of Los Angeles before they are cornered. Realizing that their future together is doomed, Roy nobly chooses to sacrifice himself, drawing the attention of their pursuers and allowing Marie to escape with the stolen money.

In the film's final moments, Roy engages in a shootout with the police, wistfully reflecting on the life he could have had with Marie. The audience is left with the image of Roy Earle, a tragic hero caught in the crossfire of fate and circumstance.
