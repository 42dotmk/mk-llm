The most logical next event would be to seek medical attention for the proper diagnosis and management of internal hemorrhoids.

1. Schedule an appointment with your physician or a specialist: The first step to take after recognizing potential signs of internal hemorrhoids is to schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or a gastroenterologist. Make sure to inform them of any recent bleeding or other concerning symptoms.

2. Prepare for the consultation: Before the appointment, make a list of any symptoms you've been experiencing, even if they seem unrelated. Also, note any lifestyle factors, medical conditions, and medications that you're currently taking. These details will help guide the conversation and allow your healthcare provider to identify potential risk factors and make an accurate diagnosis.

3. Consultation and discussion of symptoms: During the appointment, your physician will ask you about your symptoms, medical history, and any potential risk factors. Be honest and detailed in your responses to ensure a thorough understanding of your condition.

4. Physical examination: Your physician will likely perform a physical examination to assess the area for any external hemorrhoids, fissures, or other abnormalities.

5. Diagnostic tests: If your physician suspects internal hemorrhoids, they may recommend additional diagnostic tests. This may include:

   a) Digital Rectal Examination (DRE): A physician inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum to feel for any abnormal growths or masses.
   
   b) Anoscopy: A small, tube-shaped instrument called an anoscope is inserted into the rectum to visualize internal hemorrhoids and other issues within the lower rectum.
   
   c) Sigmoidoscopy: A flexible, lighted tube called a sigmoidoscope is inserted into the rectum to examine the sigmoid colon and rectum for the presence of hemorrhoids or other abnormalities.
   
   d) Colonoscopy: If there's a concern that the bleeding could be from a source other than hemorrhoids, a colonoscopy may be recommended. This procedure uses a flexible, lighted tube with a camera to examine the entire colon and rectum.

6. Diagnosis and treatment plan: Based on the findings from your consultation, physical examination, and diagnostic tests, your physician will determine if you have internal hemorrhoids and discuss the appropriate treatment options. Treatment may include:

   a) Over-the-counter medications: Pain relievers, creams, ointments, and suppositories can help alleviate the pain, discomfort, and itching associated with hemorrhoids.
   
   b) Lifestyle changes: Improving your diet, staying well-hydrated, exercising regularly, and avoiding strain during bowel movements can help prevent and manage hemorrhoid symptoms.
   
   c) Medical procedures: In more severe cases, your physician may recommend minimally invasive procedures such as rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, or infrared coagulation to treat your internal hemorrhoids.
   
   d) Surgery: If your hemorrhoids are large or do not respond well to conservative treatments, your physician may recommend surgical procedures, such as hemorrhoidectomy or stapled hemorrhoidopexy.

By following these steps and working closely with your healthcare provider, you can achieve an accurate diagnosis and develop an effective treatment plan to manage internal hemorrhoids. Remember that early intervention and active participation in your care are crucial for a successful outcome.
