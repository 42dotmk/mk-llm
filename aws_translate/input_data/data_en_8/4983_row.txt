The British liner that was sunk by a German submarine in 1915 was the RMS Lusitania. The sinking of the Lusitania is a significant event in maritime history, as it played a crucial role in influencing public opinion during World War I and contributed to the United States' decision to enter the conflict.

Launched in 1906, the RMS Lusitania was an ocean liner operated by the Cunard Line. The ship was built by John Brown and Company at its shipyard in Clydebank, Scotland. The Lusitania, alongside its sister ship RMS Mauretania, was known for its speed and elegance. The vessel was designed to carry a total of 2,198 passengers and 850 crew members and boasted a range of luxurious facilities.

In the early stages of World War I, Germany faced a naval blockade implemented by the British Royal Navy. The blockade limited Germany's access to essential resources and supplies, which in turn caused severe economic and social repercussions. German U-boats – submarines – were deployed to counteract the blockade and target both military and civilian vessels.

On May 7, 1915, the RMS Lusitania, captained by William Thomas Turner, was on a voyage from New York to Liverpool. The ship was carrying 1,959 passengers and crew members, along with a cargo that included munitions and other military supplies for the British war effort. As the Lusitania approached the southern coast of Ireland, it was spotted by a German U-boat, the U-20, commanded by Kapitänleutnant Walther Schwieger.

The U-20 fired a single torpedo, which struck the Lusitania on its starboard side. The impact triggered a secondary explosion within the ship, causing considerable damage. The vessel began to list and sink rapidly. As a result, lifeboats were either unreachable or capsized when they hit the water, and many passengers and crew members ended up in the frigid ocean water.

The Lusitania sank in less than 18 minutes, with 1,198 people losing their lives in this tragic event. This included 128 American passengers, sparking outrage in the United States. The rapid sinking of the ship is attributed to the explosion of the ship's cargo of munitions, a fact that the British government denied during the investigations that followed.

The sinking of the RMS Lusitania became a significant propaganda tool for both Britain and Germany. The British government used it to gather support from neutral countries like the United States, emphasizing the German attack on civilians and noncombatants. Germany, on the other hand, defended its actions stating that it had issued warnings to the civilians through the American newspapers not to board the Lusitania.

Initially, the United States pursued diplomatic efforts to address the loss of American lives, and President Woodrow Wilson sent a series of notes to the German government, demanding reparations and an end to submarine warfare against non-military vessels. Germany agreed to modify its naval strategy, temporarily calming the situation.

However, the sinking of the Lusitania did have long-term effects on the American public's sentiment towards Germany and played a part in the United States' decision to enter the war in 1917, following Germany's resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare and the disclosure of the Zimmermann Telegram. The tragic case of the RMS Lusitania remains a stark reminder of the devastating effects of warfare on civilian lives and the power of public opinion during times of global conflict.
