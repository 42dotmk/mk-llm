Q: Georgia is sick and coughs 5 times a minute. Her brother Robert is also sick but he coughs twice as much as her. After 20 minutes, how many times have they coughed?
A: Robert coughs twice as much as Georgia who coughs 5 times so Robert coughs 2 * 5 = 10 coughs per minute. Georgia coughs 5 times and Robert coughs 10 times so together they cough 5 + 10 = 15 times per minute. After 20 minutes they will have coughed 15 * 20 = 300 coughs. The answer is 300.
Question: Theodore can craft 10 stone statues and 20 wooden statues every month. A stone statue costs $20 and a wooden statue costs $5. He also pays 10 percent of his total earnings in taxes. How much is his total earning every month?
Answer: Theodore's total earnings from the stone statues are 10 x $20 = $200. His total earnings from wooden statues are 20 x $5 = $100. So his total earnings from the stone and wooden statue are $200 + $100 = $300. The amount he pays for the tax is $300 x 10 / 100 = $30. Therefore his total monthly earnings are $300 - $30 = $270. The answer is 270.
[Question]Luke is planning a trip to London and wants to see how long it will take him to travel there. He decides that he will take a bus to the town center, walk for 15 minutes to the train center, wait twice this long for the train to arrive, and then take the 6-hour train ride to London. If Luke’s entire trip takes him 8 hours, how many minutes does his bus ride take?
[Answer]Removing the time of the train ride from the journey shows that his trip to get on the train took him 8 hours – 6 hours = 2 hours. Converting this time into minutes shows that getting to the train took 2 hours * 60 minutes / hour = 120 minutes. Waiting for the train to arrive took twice as long as his walk, so 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes. This means that his bus ride must have taken 120 minutes – 30 minutes - 15 minutes = 75 minutes. The answer is 75.
Q: Jason drives past 3 convenience stores on his way to work. The distance between the first store and the second store is 6 miles. The distance between the second store and third store is 2/3rds longer than the distance between the first two stores. The distance from his house to the first store and the last store to work is the same, 4 miles. How long in miles is Jason's commute to work?
A: First find the additional distance between the second store and the third store: 6 miles * 2 / 3 = 4 miles. Then add that to the distance between the first two stores to find the total distance between the second and third stores: 4 miles + 6 miles = 10 miles. Then add the distance between the first two stores, the distance from Jason's house to the first store, and the distance from the last store to work: 10 miles + 6 miles + 4 miles + 4 miles = 24 miles. The answer is 24.
Question: Leo has to write a 400-word story for his literature class. 10 words fit on each line of his notebook and 20 lines fit on each page. Lucas has filled one and a half pages. How many words does he have left to write?
Answer: Half a page is 20 / 2 = 10 lines. In total, he has written 20 + 10 = 30 lines. The 30 lines written are 30 * 10 = 300 words. Lucas has 400 - 300 = 100 words left to write. The answer is 100.
