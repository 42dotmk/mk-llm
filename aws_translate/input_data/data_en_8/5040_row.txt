Question: Francis' family has 2 ukuleles, 4 guitars, and a certain number of violins. Each ukulele has 4 strings. Each guitar has 6 strings. Each violin has 4 strings. If the total number of strings among the ukuleles, guitars, and violins is 40 strings, how many violins does Francis' family have?
Answer: From the ukuleles, there are 2 * 4 = 8 strings. From the guitars, there are 4 * 6 = 24 strings. From the violins, there are 40 - 8 - 24 = 8 strings. The total number of violins Francis' family has is 8 / 4 = 2 violins. The answer is 2.
[Question]Lydia is planning a road trip with her family and is trying to plan a route. She has 60 liters of fuel and she will use all of this during her trip. She isn't sure how much fuel she is going to use in the first third of the trip but she knows she will need a third of all of her fuel for the second third of the trip, and half this amount for the final third of the trip. How much fuel, in liters, can Lydia use in the first third of the trip?
[Answer]In the second third of the trip, Lydia is going to use 60 liters of fuel / 3 = 20 liters of fuel. In the final third of the trip, she needs half of this amount so she is going to be using 20 liters / 2 = 10 liters of fuel. So in the first third, Lydia used the remaining amount of fuel which is 60 total liters of fuel – 20 liters of fuel in the second third – 10 liters of fuel in the final third = 30 liters of fuel. The answer is 30.

Question: Pastor Paul prays 20 times per day, except on Sunday, when he prays twice as much. Pastor Bruce prays half as much as Pastor Paul, except on Sundays, when he prays twice as much as Pastor Paul. How many more times does Pastor Paul pray than Pastor Bruce prays in a week?
Answer: Pastor Paul prays 20 * 6 = 120 days per week, except Sunday. On Sunday, Pastor Paul prays 2 * 20 = 40 times. Per week, Pastor Paul prays 120 + 40 = 160 times. Pastor Bruce prays half as much as Pastor Paul does on all days except Sunday, for a total of 120 / 2 = 60 times. Pastor Bruce prays twice as much on Sundays as does Pastor Paul, or 40 * 2 = 80 times. In total, Pastor Bruce prays 60 + 80 = 140 times per week. Thus, per week, Pastor Paul prays 160 - 140 = 20 more times per week than Pastor Bruce. The answer is 20.
[Question]To make yogurt, the company needs milk and fruit. Milk is bought at $1.5 per liter and fruit at $2 per kilogram. To make one batch of yogurt, the company needs 10 liters of milk, and 3 kilograms of fruit. How much does it cost the firm to produce three batches of yogurt?
[Answer]For the fruits, the company needs to pay 3 * 2 = $6 per batch. 10 liters of milk is a cost of 10 * 1.5 = $15 for the company. So in total one batch is a cost of 15 + 6 = $21. So three batches of yogurt is a cost of 3 * 21 = $63. The answer is 63.
