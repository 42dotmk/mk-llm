First question answer:
In Fallout 4, determining the "best" companion depends on your personal playstyle and preferences. However, a popular favorite among many players is Paladin Danse, a member of the Brotherhood of Steel. This is because he has a strong Power Armor, making him a great tank who can take a lot of damage in combat while also dealing considerable damage to enemies. Additionally, his perk, "Know Your Enemy," grants you a 20% bonus damage against Feral Ghouls, Super Mutants, and Synths.

Other notable companions include:
1. Nick Valentine: A synth detective with a unique personality and intriguing storyline. His perk, "Close to Metal," gives you one extra chance for hacking and reduces the cooldown time for lockouts.
2. Piper: A journalist with her own sense of charm and charisma. Her perk, "Gift of Gab," grants you double the experience for speech challenges and discovering new locations.
3. Dogmeat: A loyal canine companion who can find extra items and never judges your choices. Dogmeat doesn't have a specific companion perk but can be used in addition to any other human or synthetic companion with the "Lone Wanderer" perk.

Each companion caters to a different playstyle and has their advantages and drawbacks. It's essential to choose the one that fits your preferences and complements your gameplay.
