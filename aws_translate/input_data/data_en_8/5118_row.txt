[Question]Merill has twice as many marbles as Elliot and the two of them together have five fewer marbles than Selma. If Selma has fifty marbles, how many marbles does Merill have?
[Answer]If Selma has fifty marbles, then Merill and Elliot together have 50 - 5 = 45 marbles. We'll assume the number of marbles that Elliot has is x. If Merill has twice as many marbles as Elliot, then the total number of marbles that Merill and Elliot have together is 2x + x = 45 marbles. This translates to 3x = 45. The number of marbles that Elliot has is x = 45 / 3. This means Elliot has x = 15 marbles. Since Merill has twice as many marbles as Elliot, Merill has 2 * 15 = 30 marbles. The answer is 30.
Q: Trish likes to go for walks every day. One day, she goes on a 1-mile walk. Every subsequent day, she doubles the distance she walked the previous day. On what day does she walk more than 10 times further than she did on the first day?
A: Trish walks 1 mile on the first day, and since she walks double the previous day's amount each day that means she walks 1 * 2 = 2 miles the second day. On the following day, she walks double the distance of the previous day's total of 2 miles, meaning she walks 2 * 2 = 4 miles that day. On the following day, she walks double the distance of the previous day's total of 4 miles, meaning she walks 4 * 2 = 8 miles that day. On the following day, she walks double the distance of the previous day's total of 8 miles, meaning she walks 8 * 2 = 16 miles that day. As we're looking for the first day that her distance exceeds 10 times her original total, that means we're seeking a mile total of greater than or equal to 10 * 1 = 10 miles,. Since she accomplished this on the 5th day of walking, the answer is 5. The answer is 5.

[Question]Alyssa took 100 photos on vacation. She wants to put them in a photo album with 30 pages. She can place 3 photos each on the first 10 pages. Then she can place 4 photos each on the next 10 pages. If she wants to put an equal number of photos on each of the remaining pages of the album, how many photos can she place on each page?
[Answer]There are 3 x 10 = 30 photos in total that can be placed in the first 10 pages. There are 4 x 10 = 40 photos in total that can be placed in the next 10 pages. A total of 10 + 10 = 20 pages of the album have been used. A total of 30 + 40 = 70 photos can be placed on those 20 pages. So there are still 100 - 70 = 30 photos left to be placed on the album. And there are 30 - 20 = 10 pages left in the album. Therefore, 30 / 10 = 3 photos can be placed on each of the pages. The answer is 3.
Q: Karen has 32 quarters in her piggy bank. Her older brother Christopher has 64 quarters in his piggy bank. How much more money does Christopher have?
