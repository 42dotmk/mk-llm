[Question]James is trying to create a new breed of kittens with extra-long tails. Each generation of kittens he breeds has a tail 25% longer than the last generation. If the first generation has tails 16 cm long, how long are the third generation's tails?
[Answer]First find how much longer the second generation's tails are: 25% * 16 cm = 4 cm. Then add that length to the first generation's tail length to find the second generation's tail length: 4 cm + 16 cm = 20 cm. Then find how much longer the third generation's tails are: 25% * 20 cm = 5 cm. Then add that length to the second generation's tail length to find the third generation's tail length: 5 cm + 20 cm = 25 cm. The answer is 25.
Q: Grant scored 10 points higher on his math test than John. John received twice as many points as Hunter who scored a 45 on his math test. What was Grant's test score?
A: John received twice as many points as Hunter, who received a 45 so John scored 2 * 45 = 90 on his test. Grants scored 10 more points than John who got a 90 so Grant received 10 + 90 = 100 on his test. The answer is 100.
Question: Emily is on a flight from New York to Hawaii that is 10 hours long. To kill time, she watches 3 TV episodes that are each 25 minutes long. Then she sleeps for 4 and a half hours. Then she watches 2 movies that are each an hour and 45 minutes long. After doing all these things, assuming there is no break time between activities, how many more minutes are left in the flight before Emily reaches Hawaii.
Answer: Emily spends 3 episodes * 25 minutes = 75 minutes watching TV. Emily spends 4.5 hours * 60 minutes = 270 minutes sleeping. Emily spends 2 movies * 1.75 hours * 60 minutes = 210 minutes watching movies. The total time spent doing activities is 75 + 270 + 210 = 555 minutes. The total length of the flight is 10 hours * 60 minutes = 600 minutes. The number of minutes remaining in the flight is 600 - 555 = 45 minutes. The answer is 45.
[Question]John takes 3 days off of streaming per week. On the days he does stream, he streams for 4 hours at a time and makes $10 an hour. How much does he make a week?
[Answer]He streams for 7 - 3 = 4 days a week. So he streams 4 * 4 = 16 hours a week. That means he makes 16 * 10 = $160 a week. The answer is 160.
Q: Nancy wants to figure out if she can afford to apply to the University of Michigan. The tuition costs $22,000 per semester. Her parents can pay half the cost, and each semester Nancy can get a scholarship for $3,000 and a student loan for twice her scholarship amount. If Nancy can work a total of 200 hours during the semester, how many dollars does she have to make per hour to pay the rest of the tuition?
A: First figure out how much Nancy has to pay after her parents pay their half by dividing the tuition by 2: $22,000 / 2 = $11,000. Then figure out how much Nancy's student loan is by multiplying her scholarship amount by 2: $3,000 * 2 = $6,000. Now subtract the amounts of Nancy's scholarship and loan to find out how much tuition she has to pay by working: $11,000 - $3,000 - $6,000 = $2,000. Now divide the remaining unpaid tuition by the number of hours Nancy works to find out how much she needs to make per hour: $2,000 / 200 hours = $10 / hour. The answer is 10.
