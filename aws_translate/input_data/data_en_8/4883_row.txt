[Question]Bea's mom planted 50 Mahogany and 30 Narra trees on their farm. Due to a typhoon, a total of 5 trees fell. One more Mahogany tree fell than the number of Narra trees that fell. A month after the typhoon, Bea's mom planted twice as much as the number of the Narra and thrice the number of Mahogany trees that fell. How many trees are now on the farm?
[Answer]Before the typhoon, their farm had a total of 50 trees + 30 trees = 80 trees. If there was 1 more than Mahogany than Narra tree that fell, then this means there were 2 Narra trees and 2 + 1 = 3 Mahogany trees that fell during the typhoon. So, Bea's mom planted 2 trees x 2 = 4 Narra trees. She also planted 3 trees x 3 = 9 Mahogany trees. So, her mom planted 4 trees + 9 trees = 13 more trees. After the typhoon, they only had 80 trees - 5 trees = 75 trees left. Therefore, there are 75 trees + 13 trees = 88 trees now. The answer is 88.
Q: Lillian is making chocolate cupcakes to sell at a fundraiser. She only has 3 cups of sugar at home. She goes to the store and buys 2 bags of sugar. Each bag of sugar contains 6 cups. The batter uses 1 cup of sugar per 12 cupcakes. She needs 2 cups of sugar to make enough frosting for a dozen cupcakes. How many dozen cupcakes can she bake and ice with the sugar she has?
A: The bags of sugar which she bought contain 2 * 6 = 12 cups. In total, she has 12 cups + 3 cups = 15 cups of sugar to use. She needs 1 cup + 2 cups = 3 cups of sugar to make the batter and frosting for a dozen cupcakes. Lillian has enough sugar to bake and ice 15 / 3 = 5 dozen cupcakes. The answer is 5.
Question: Emma and Briana invested some capital into a business. Emma's investment is supposed to yield 15% of the capital annually while Briana's should yield 10% annually. If Emma invested $300 and Briana invested $500, what will be the difference between their return-on-investment after 2 years?
Answer: 15% of $300 is (15 / 100) * $300 = $45. Emma will earn an annual ROI of $45 for 2 years for a total of $45 * 2 = $90. 10% of $500 is (10 / 100) * $500 = $50. Briana will earn an annual ROI of $50 for 2 years for a total of $50 * 2 = $100. The difference between their ROI after 2 years is $100 - $90 = $10. The answer is 10.
[Question]A man loves to go hiking. He knows that he has to pack about .5 pounds of supplies for every mile he hikes. He plans to go for a very long hike. He knows that he can get 1 resupply during the hike that will be 25% as large as his first pack. He can hike at a rate of 2.5 mph. He is going to hike 8 hours a day for 5 days. How much does he need to bring with his first pack?
[Answer]He is going to hike 8 * = 40 hours. That means he will be hiking for 40 * 2.5 = 100 miles. So he needs 100 * .5 = 50 pounds of supplies. With the resupply he can get up to 1 + .25 = 1.25 times his initial pack. That means his initial pack has to weigh 50 / 1.25 = 40 pounds. The answer is 40.
