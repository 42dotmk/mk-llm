Before selling land to settlers, the New Zealand Company, a private land investment company founded by Edward Gibbon Wakefield in the early 19th century, primarily purchased land from the indigenous Māori people of New Zealand.

The New Zealand Company aimed to facilitate the systematic colonization of New Zealand by European settlers, by establishing settlements, organizing transportation, and promoting overseas immigration. Central to its plans was the acquisition of large tracts of land that would then be subdivided and sold to settlers at a profit, with the proceeds used to fund further settlement work.

Initially, the Company attempted to negotiate land purchases directly with local Māori chiefs, employing agents to enter into agreements with local tribes. The Company believed that they could secure vast lands from the Māori people for relatively low prices, but relied heavily on the negotiation skills of their agents and the assumption that the Māori chiefs had a full understanding of the transactions.

One of the most significant land purchases took place in 1839 when the Company agent, William Wakefield (the brother of the Company's founder), arrived in New Zealand and negotiated the purchase of approximately 20 million acres (around 8.1 million hectares) of land from the local Māori tribes. This acquisition became known as the "first and principal purchase" and encompassed large portions of present-day Wellington, Wanganui, and Taranaki.

However, many of these land purchases were fraught with controversy and misunderstandings. The Māori people often had differing concepts of land ownership from the European settlers, and some believed they were only granting temporary rights to use the land, rather than transferring permanent ownership. These discrepancies led to numerous disputes and conflicts between Māori tribes and the New Zealand Company over the legitimacy of land purchases. Furthermore, the New Zealand government later disputed some of these agreements, as they contravened the Treaty of Waitangi, signed in 1840 between representatives of the British Crown and over 500 Māori chiefs, which required that all land sales needed to go through the Crown.

In response to these issues, the New Zealand government stepped in to establish a process for investigating and verifying land purchases, known as the Land Claims Commission, which was set up in 1840. The Commission scrutinized the land purchase agreements between the New Zealand Company and the Māori tribes and found that many of them were not valid.

Despite these controversies, the New Zealand Company continued to play a vital role in the colonization of New Zealand, establishing several settlements and attracting thousands of settlers to the country. However, it faced numerous difficulties, including land disputes and financial troubles, which ultimately led to its dissolution in 1850. From that point on, the British Crown assumed direct responsibility for managing land purchases and the colonization process in New Zealand.

In summary, the New Zealand Company mainly bought land from the indigenous Māori people before selling it to settlers, albeit through a process marred by misunderstandings and legal disputes. The role of the New Zealand Company, and its legacy, continues to be an important aspect of New Zealand's history, particularly in relation to Māori-European interactions and the development of modern landownership systems in the country.
