sunrise cast a warm glow over the city as Miguel made his way to the office. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the scent of baked goods from the small cafe down the street. His stomach growled quietly, a reminder that it was time for his favorite breakfast ritual: a delicious, perfectly toasted bagel.

Miguel never understood his colleagues' obsession with toast. To him, it was nothing more than a dry, bland canvas for the toppings of the world. On the other hand, bagels offered a more complex flavor and that amazing chewiness that Miguel simply couldn't resist. In his mind, there was nothing better than sinking his teeth into a warm, soft bagel slathered with cream cheese to start the day.

Raymond, one of Miguel's coworkers, joined him one day in the break room as he toasted his bagel to just the right golden brown hue. Raymond raised an eyebrow and asked him, "Why not toast, Miguel? Don't you get bored of bagels every single day?"

Miguel smiled as he spread a generous amount of cream cheese over his bagel. "It's not about the bagel itself, Raymond. It's the ritual, the comfort, and the way it sets the tone for my day. Besides, there are so many different flavors and combinations to choose from," he explained.

Raymond nodded, intrigued by Miguel's perspective. "Well, you do have a point. I can see how the routine can be soothing."

As they continued their conversation, Miguel couldn't help but reflect on the deeper meaning behind his bagel preference. Sure, it was just a breakfast food, but it carried a sense of familiarity and consistency that he often craved in his hectic life. The morning bagel ritual provided him with an anchor, a moment of solace in the eye of the storm that was his daily routine.

Over the following weeks, Miguel started to notice that some of his colleagues had begun to discover the magic of bagels. In the break room, they shared their favorite flavor combinations and toppings, exchanging excited banter as they toasted their breakfast treats. It was fascinating to Miguel how something as simple as a bagel could create a sense of connection and camaraderie among his coworkers.

One particular morning, when a fresh batch of bagels arrived in the office, Jasmine, the office manager, provided a surprise spread of different cream cheese flavors and jams for everyone to try. The break room buzzed with chatter as everyone slathered their chosen concoctions onto their preferred bagels, some laughing in delight at their newfound love for the versatile ring-shaped bread.

As Miguel stood in the corner observing the lively scene, he couldn't help but feel a sense of pride. His love for bagels had turned into a small movement within the office, creating memorable moments amongst his coworkers in the process. He realized that what was once merely a personal breakfast choice had now transformed into a shared experience, weaving its way into the fabric of their daily lives.

As the weeks went on, Miguel continued to enjoy his bagel-laden mornings with his colleagues. Each bite reminded him of the importance of finding joy in the smallest of details, whether it be a warm, toasted bagel or a heartwarming conversation with a friend. And although toast still made its appearance in the break room, Miguel believed he had shown his coworkers the blissful taste of bagelhood, turning even the most ardent toast lovers into bagel enthusiasts.

The end.
