Yes, a 1913 report by Sir Baldwin Spencer is a good answer to the question, but it can be elaborated upon for a more detailed and comprehensive response:

Throughout history, various individuals and organizations have reported and documented the treatment of Aborigines in Australia. One such significant account is from Sir Baldwin Spencer, a British-Australian anthropologist, who wrote a report on the status and treatment of Aboriginal people in 1913. However, several other reports and accounts can provide further insight into the treatment of Aborigines.

1. Sir Baldwin Spencer's 1913 report: Sir Baldwin Spencer, a prominent anthropologist, and biologist, was appointed as the special commissioner for Aboriginal affairs in the Northern Territory in 1913. In his report, he painted a grim picture of the living conditions and dire situation faced by Indigenous Australians during that time. His observations detailed the impact of European settlers, dispossession of land, and the decline of traditional culture. The report revealed issues such as exploitation, violence, and discrimination against the Aboriginal people. It called for significant changes in government policy to improve the lives of Indigenous Australians.

2. Humanitarian groups and organizations: Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, missionary groups and other religious organizations were actively involved in reporting the ill-treatment of Aborigines. These organizations often emphasized the need for protection and education for Indigenous Australians, voicing concerns over forced labor, abuse, and living conditions. Several church publications and personal accounts of missionaries provided firsthand accounts of the mistreatment of Aboriginal people.

3. Royal Commissions and inquiries: There have been numerous government inquiries and Royal Commissions, which have investigated various aspects of Aboriginal affairs. For instance, the 1967 referendum led to constitutional changes to recognize Aboriginal people as equal citizens. This, in turn, resulted in a sense of responsibility on the government to investigate and improve the treatment of Aborigines. Major investigations, like the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (1987-1991) and the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from their Families (led by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in 1997), exposed the systematic mistreatment and racism experienced by Aboriginal people.

4. Personal accounts and writings: Many Indigenous Australians have shared their experiences through autobiographies, literary works, and other forms of storytelling. These accounts provide unique and personal insight into the treatment of Aboriginal people throughout history. Notable examples include the works of authors such as Oodgeroo Noonuccal, Jack Davis, and Archie Weller, whose writings emphasize the hurt and suffering of Indigenous Australians due to discrimination, cultural loss, and historical trauma.

In summary, while Sir Baldwin Spencer's 1913 report is an important documentation of how Aborigines were treated, it is essential to consider and acknowledge the many other reports, inquiries, and personal accounts that further reveal the injustices faced by Indigenous Australians. These various sources highlight the need for greater understanding, awareness, and advocacy for Aboriginal people and their rights.
