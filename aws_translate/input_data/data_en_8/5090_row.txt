[Question]Billy is counting the rings in two trees. Weather fluctuations in this area mean that each tree's rings are in groups of two fat rings and four thin rings. If Billy counts 70 ring groups in the first tree and 40 ring groups in the second tree, how much older is the first tree? (Trees grow 1 ring per year.)
[Answer]First find the total number of rings in a ring group: 2 rings + 4 rings = 6 rings. Then subtract the number of ring groups in the second tree from the number in the first tree to find the difference: 70 groups - 40 groups = 30 groups. Then multiply that number by the number of rings in a group to find the difference in the trees' ages: 30 groups * 6 rings / group = 180 rings, or 180 years. The answer is 180.
Q: A mountain range has 200 active volcanoes. In a particular year, 20% of the volcanoes exploded in the first two months, 40% of the remaining exploded by the half of the year, and at the end of the year, another 50% of the volcanoes that hadn't already erupted also exploded. How many mountains are still intact at the end of the year?
A: By the first two months, 20 / 100 * 200 = 40 mountains had erupted. The total number of mountains remaining after the first round of explosions is 200 - 40 = 160. When 40% of the remaining mountains exploded, the number of mountains that were still intact decreased by 40 / 100 * 160 = 64. The number of mountains that hadn't exploded after the second explosions is 160 - 64 = 96. When 50% of the mountains which were still intact exploded, the number of mountains that hadn't erupted was reduced by 50 / 100 * 96 = 48. At the end of the year, 96 - 48 = 48 mountains remained intact and hadn't exploded. The answer is 48.
Question: It takes a dog groomer 10 minutes to dry a short-haired dog like a beagle. It takes him twice as long to dry a full-haired, fluffy dog like a german shepherd. One morning, he has 6 short-haired dogs to dry and 9 full-haired dogs to dry. How many hours does it take him to dry all of the dogs?
Answer: It takes 10 minutes to dry the coat of a short - haired dog and twice as long for a full haired dog so they take 10 * 2 = 20 minutes to dry. He had 6 short hair dogs and they took 10 minutes to dry each so they took 6 * 10 = 60 minutes to dry. He had 9 full haired dogs that took 20 minutes to dry each so they took 9 * 20 = 180 minutes to dry. Together is takes him 60 + 180 = 240 minutes to dry all of the dogs. 60 minutes are in 1 hour and he spends 240 minutes on the dogs so he worked for 240 / 60 = 4 hours drying the dogs. The answer is 4.
[Question]Jeremy buys 3 bags of chips for a party. Stacy and Emily also buy chips for the party. If they need 10 bags of chips total, and Stacy buys 4 bags, how many bags of chips should Emily buy?
[Answer]Jeremy and Stacy buy 3 + 4 = 7 bags of chips. Since there needs to be 10 total, Emily should buy 10 - 7 = 3 bags of chips. The answer is 3.
Q: There are 400 students in the senior class at East High School. 52% of the students play sports. Of the students that play sports, 12.5% play soccer. How many students play soccer?
A: The number of students that play sports is 400 * 0.52 = 208 students. The number of students that play soccer is 208 * .125 = 26 students. The answer is 26.
