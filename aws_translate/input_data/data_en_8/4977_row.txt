Act 1:
Our story begins with a flashback of Martha and Ray as idealistic, young adults living in New York City. Both struggle to make ends meet - Martha as a waitress and Ray as a mechanic. They meet at a city park, quickly fall in love, and dream of a better life outside the confines of their impoverished existence.

Vincent uses his leverage over Ray to force him into increasingly dangerous and morally compromised situations.

Meanwhile, a detail-oriented and relentless detective named Michael Donovan starts investigating the crime syndicate after Vincent's organization is connected to several high-profile cases. Donovan is the classic straight-laced cop who lives and breathes duty, but he finds himself gaining an odd admiration for the love between Ray and Martha, which becomes apparent as his investigation continues.

With Donovan closing in, Vincent demands that Martha and Ray participate in a big heist to secure their freedom from his ever-tightening grip. Reluctantly, they agree, but the heist goes terribly wrong, and a police officer is killed in the ensuing chaos. Martha and Ray now find themselves on the run, with Donovan hot on their heels.

After a thrilling chase through the streets of New York City, Donovan apprehends the couple and arrests them. In a heart-wrenching scene, they are separated and brought to stand trial.
