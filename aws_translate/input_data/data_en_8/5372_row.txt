Question: A bakery sells boxes of doughnuts and if there are any doughnuts left at the end of the day, the bakery gives them away. Each box of doughnuts holds 10 doughnuts and all of the doughnuts that the bakery makes are put into these boxes. The bakery makes 300 doughnuts for the day and sells 27 boxes of doughnuts throughout the day. How many doughnuts are given away at the end of the day?
Answer: The bakery has made 300 total doughnuts / 10 doughnuts per box = 30 boxes of doughnuts. So at the end of the day, they still have 30 total boxes of doughnuts â€“ 27 sold boxes of doughnuts = 3 boxes of doughnuts leftover. They are therefore giving away 3 boxes of doughnuts * 10 doughnuts per box = 30 doughnuts. The answer is 30.

Q: In a school, the number of participants in the 2018 Science Quiz Bowl was 150. There were 20 more than twice the number of participants in 2019 as there were in 2018. In 2020, the number of participants was 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019. How many more participants were there in 2019 than in 2020?
A: Twice the number of participants in 2018 is 150 participants x 2 = 300 participants. The number of participants in 2019 was 300 participants + 20 participants = 320 participants. Half the number of participants in 2019 is 320 participants / 2 = 160 participants. The number of participants in 2020 was 160 participants - 40 participants = 120 participants. There were 320 participants - 120 participants = 200 more participants in 2019 than in 2020. The answer is 200.
Question: A seminar is offered to a school for their teachers. The regular seminar fee is $150 but they offer a 5% discount if they register 2 days before the scheduled seminar. The school registered 10 teachers for the seminar a week before the schedule and it also released a $10 food allowance for each of the teachers. How much did the school spend in all?
Answer: The school got a $150 x 5 / 100 = $7.50 seminar fee discount for each teacher. Each teacher's seminar fee costs $150 - $7.50 = $142.50. So, ten teachers' seminar fees cost $142.50 x 10 = $1425. The food allowance for 10 teachers amounts to $10 x 10 = $100. Therefore, the school spent a total of $1425 + $100 = $1525. The answer is 1525.
[Question]John decides to go back to school to get his PhD. He first takes 1 year of courses to get acclimated back to school life before starting his PhD. After that, he spends 2 years learning the basics of his field. He then starts research, and he spends 75% more time on research than he did learning the basics. He then spends half as long on writing his dissertation as his acclimation period. How long did it take him to do everything?
[Answer]It took him 2 * .75 = 1.5 years longer to do his research than it took to learn the basics. So it took him a total of 2 + 1.5 = 3.5 years to do research. His dissertation took 1 / 2 = .5 years to write. So everything together took 1 + 2 + 3.5 + .5 = 7 years. The answer is 7.
