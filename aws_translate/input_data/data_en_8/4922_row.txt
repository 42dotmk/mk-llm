Reasoning and answer: When he gave 40 seashells to his friends, Ali had 180 - 40 = 140 seashells. When he gave another 30 seashells to his brothers, he had 140 - 30 = 110 seashells. He also sold half of the seashells, a total of 1 / 2 * 110 = 55 seashells. He was left with 110 - 55 = 55 seashells.
The answer: 55

Question: Ali had a collection of seashells. He started with 180 seashells. He then gave away 40 seashells to his friends. He also gave 30 seashells to his brothers. If he sold half of the remaining seashells, how many seashells did he have left?

Jill's second customer buys 4 times more than her first customer's 5 boxes, so they buy 4 * 5 = 20 boxes. Jill's third customer buys half of what her second customer bought, so that means they buy 20 / 2 = 10 boxes. Jill's fourth customer buys 3 times as many as what her third customer bought, so that means they buy 10 * 3 = 30 boxes. Adding in the 5 boxes sold to the first customer, and the 10 boxes sold to the last one, that means Jill has sold 5 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 30 = 75 boxes. Since Jill's goal is 150 boxes sold, and she's only sold 75 so far, she needs to sell 150 - 75 = 75 more boxes to hit her goal.
The answer: 75

Out of the 40, 40 x 1 / 10 = 4 students are absent. So, 40 - 4 = 36 students are present in school. Out of the 36, 36 x 3 / 4 = 27 students are in the classroom. This means, 36 - 27 = 9 students are in the canteen.
The answer: 9
Reverse engineering the question: There are 40 students in a class. If 1/10 are absent, 3/4 of the students who are present are in the classroom, and the rest are in the canteen, how many students are in the canteen?

Reasoning and answer: The weight plates cost 200 * 1.2 = $240. So his vest cost 250 + 240 = $490. He could get the other vest for 700 - 100 = $600. So he saved 600 - 490 = $110.
The answer: 110

Reasoning and answer: To figure out this problem we need to turn it into an equation. Letâ€™s make A the number of nuggets Alyssa ate. We know all three girls ate 100 nuggets total, so 100 nuggets = A (how many Alyssa ate) + 2A (how many Keely ate) + 3A (how many Kendall ate) or 100 = A + 2A + 3A which is 100 = 5A. Then we will divide each side by 5 to figure out how many nuggets Alyssa ate, 100 / 5 = 5A / 5 or 20 = A.
The answer: 20
