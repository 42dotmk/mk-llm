Q: Victor, Austin, and Brian made traps to catch shrimp. Victor's trap caught 26 shrimp and Austin's trap caught 8 less than Victor's. Brian's trap caught half of Victor and Austin's total number of shrimp. If the boys then sold their shrimp for $7 for every 11 tails of shrimp and then divided their earnings equally amongst themselves, how much money does each boy make?
A: Austin's trap caught 26 - 8 = 18 shrimp. Together, Victor and Austin's traps caught 18 + 26 = 44 shrimp. Brian's trap caught 44 / 2 = 22 shrimp. In total, they caught 26 + 18 + 22 = 66 shrimp. They were able to sell 66 / 11 = 6 sets of shrimp. They made a total of 6 x $7 = $42. Each boy made $42 / 3 = $14. The answer is 14.
Question: There are 50 passengers on a bus. At the first stop, 16 more passengers get on the bus. On the other stops, 22 passengers get off the bus and 5 passengers more get on the bus. How many passengers are there on the bus in total at the last station?
Answer: There are 50 + 16 = 66 passengers at first. Then 66 - 22 = 44 passengers remain. Since 5 more passengers get on the bus there are 44 + 5 = 49 passengers on the bus. The answer is 49.
[Question]Haily wants to go to the salon and do her nails, cut her hair and do a facial cleaning. She doesn't want to spend much, so she called 3 salons to get their prices: Gustran Salon, Barbara's Shop, and The Fancy Salon. At Gustran Salon, the haircut is $45, the facial cleaning is $22 and the nails are $30. At Barbara's shop, the nails are $40, the haircut is $30 and the facial cleaning is $28. And, at the Fancy Salon, the facial cleaning is $30, the haircut is $34 and the nails are $20. How much would Haily spend at the cheapest salon?
[Answer]So first, we should add the prices of all salons. At Gustran Salon, the total price is: $45 + $22 + $30 = $97. The total price at Barbara's shop is: $40 + $30 + $28 = $98. The total price at The Fancy Salon is: $30 + $34 + $20 = $84. At Gustran salon she would spend $97, at Barbara's Shop she would spend $98, and at The Fancy Salon she would spend $84, so she would spend $84 at the cheapest salon. The answer is 84.
Q: Martha collected 90 cans while Diego collected 10 more than half the cans collected by Martha. If both of them should collect a total of 150 cans for their project, how many more cans do they need to collect?
A: Half the cans collected by Martha is 90 / 2 = 45. So, Diego collected 45 + 10 = 55 cans. Martha and Diego collected 90 + 55 = 145 cans together. Thus, they need to collect 150 - 145 = 5 more cans. The answer is 5.
Question: Joy fosters dogs. The mom foster dog eats 1.5 cups of food, three times a day. The puppies each eat 1/2 cup of food, twice a day. There are 5 puppies. How much food will Joy need for the next 6 days?
Answer: The mom dog eats 1.5 cups of food * 3 = 4.5 cups per day. For 6 days the mom dog will need 6 * 4.5 cups = 27 cups of food. The puppies eat 1 / 2 cup of food * 2 = 1 cup per day. There are 5 puppies * 1 cup = 5 cups per day for the puppies. For the 6 days, the puppies will need 5 cups * 6 = 30 cups of food. Combined the dogs will need 27 cups + 30 cups = 57 cups. The answer is 57.
