[Question]Surfers enjoy going to the Rip Curl Myrtle Beach Surf Festival. There were 1500 surfers at the Festival on the first day, 600 more surfers on the second day than the first day, and 2/5 as many surfers on the third day as the first day. What is the average number of surfers at the Festival for the three days?
[Answer]If there were 1500 surfers on the first day, the total for the second day is 1500 surfers + 600 surfers = 2100 surfers. On the third day, the number of surfers was 2 / 5 * 1500 surfers = 600 surfers. The total number of surfers at the Festival in the three days was 1500 surfers + 2100 surfers + 600 surfers = 4200 surfers. The average number of surfers at the Beach Surf Festival for the three days is 4200 surfers / 3 days = 1400 surfers / day. The answer is 1400.
Q: Johnny is a guitar player and he has three colors of guitar picks: red, blue, and yellow. Half of his picks are red, one-third of the picks are blue, and the rest are yellow. If he has 12 blue picks, what is the total number of yellow picks in his collection?
A: If one third (1 / 3) of his picks are blue, then 3 times the total number of blue picks equals his total pick count, or 3 * 12 = 36 picks. If half of the picks are red, then he has 36 / 2 = 18 red picks. If the rest of the picks are yellow, then he has 36 - 18 - 12 = 6 yellow picks. The answer is 6.
Question: Lyanna set up a food bank to collect food to give to the homeless in her local town. In the first week, 40 pounds of food were donated to the food bank by the people of her local town. In the second week, donations were twice as high as the first week. If she gave out 70% of the donated food to the homeless in the third week, calculate the amount of food remaining in the food bank.
Answer: If 40 pounds of food was donated to the food bank in the first week, the second week, which had twice the amount of food donated as the first week, had 2 * 40 = 80 pounds of food. The total amount of food donated to the food bank after the second week is 40 + 80 = 120 pounds. In the third week, she gave to the homeless 70 / 100 * 120 = 84 pounds of food. The total amount of food remaining in the food bank after she gave out 70% to the homeless is 120 - 84 = 36 pounds of food. The answer is 36.
[Question]Gary has 6 pounds of flour. He will use 4 pounds of flour to make cakes which require 0.5 pounds of flour each. The remaining 2 pounds of flour will be used to bake cupcakes, which require 1/5 pounds of flour. He plans to sell the cakes for $2.5 each and the cupcakes for $1 each in the school's bake sale. How much will Gary earn?
[Answer]Gary can bake 4 / 0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour. He can bake 2 / 1 / 5 = 10 cupcakes from the 2 pounds of flour. So, he will earn $2.5 x 8 = $20 from the cakes. Hence, Gary will earn a total of $20 + $10 = $30 from baking 8 cakes and 10 cupcakes. The answer is 30.
Q: Charley has a bag that contains 51 white beads and 90 black beads. He reaches in the bag and pulls out 1/6 of the black beads and a third of the white beads. How many beads in total did Charley pull out?
