Becoming an animal trainer involves a variety of steps, each with its own set of skills and knowledge. In broad strokes, here is a detailed process that can guide someone to accomplish the goal of becoming an animal trainer.

1. **Research the Profession**: Understand what being an animal trainer entails. Research the different types of legal requirements in your location. Consider the daily tasks, scheduling, client interaction, animal behavior management, and overarching responsibilities associated with the profession. Look into job outlook, average salary, and job growth predictions too. Being an animal trainer can give you the opportunity to work in a variety of settings, including zoos, aquariums, movie sets, or private homes.

2. **Educational Requirements**: While a high school diploma or an equivalent is often a minimum educational requirement, having a bachelor's degree in biology, animal behaviour, or a similar field will significantly improve your candidacy. Degree programs often offer coursework in areas like wildlife studies, animal behaviour, and animal nutrition.

3. **Get Experience with Animals**: Experience is crucial in this line of work. Volunteer or work in places where you could work with animals like veterinary clinics, animal shelters, farms, stables, or boarding kennels. This experience can provide you with practical knowledge about animal habits, behavior and care requirements.

4. **Obtain Necessary Certification**: Depending on where you live and the specific type of animal you want to train, you may need to be certified. For example, to become a pet dog trainer, you may pursue certification through organizations like the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers or the Association of Professional Dog Trainers. These certifications usually involve coursework, exams, and sometimes practical assessments or internships.

5. **Specialize**: Figure out what type of animal trainer you want to be. This might include dogs, cats, horses, birds, marine animals, and more. Each of these animals require different kinds of knowledge and techniques for training. Additionally, some specialize in specific areas such as obedience, agility, hunting, service dogs, therapy animals, or animal acting.

6. **Get a Job as an Animal Trainer**: Look for job postings in local classifieds, online employment websites, animal organizations and professional trainer associations. As a start, you might work as an assistant to a seasoned trainer where you can learn hands-on training techniques.

7. **Develop Your Skills**: Keep learning, improving, updating and practicing your skills. Attend seminars, workshops and conferences, read relevant literature, and stay updated with the latest research in animal behavior. Building a strong network with other professionals in your field can also present opportunities for continual learning and professional growth. 

8. **Start Your Own Business or Freelance**: After gaining some experience, you might consider starting your own animal training business or providing freelance animal training services. This would require additional skills in business, marketing, and customer service.

Remember, patience, compassion, and solid communication skills are also key qualities that will help you succeed as an animal trainer. It is a rewarding career where you get to strengthen the bond between humans and animals and ensure the welfare of animals. Good luck!
