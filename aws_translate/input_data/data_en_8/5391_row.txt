Though Questions 1 and 2 are similar in nature as they both deal with the same theme of lost PAN cards and their reissuance, they are not exactly the same. Question 1 focuses on an individual who lost their PAN card and wants to obtain a new one with the same number, while Question 2 is about a lost company PAN card and the application process when the user already has a copy of the card.

Answer for Question 1:
In order to obtain a new PAN card with the old PAN number as an individual, you can follow these steps:

1. Visit the official website of Tax Information Network - National Securities Depository Limited (TIN-NSDL) at https://www.tin-nsdl.com/
2. Under the "Services" section, click on "PAN" and then select "Apply" under "Reprint of PAN Card."
3. You will be redirected to the application page for the reissuance of PAN Card. Fill out the application form 49A for Indian citizens and 49AA for foreign citizens.

5. Fill in your personal details such as your name, date of birth, address, and other required information.
6. Ensure that all details provided match your original PAN card application.
7. Attach the required supporting documents, including proof of identity, proof of address, and passport-sized photographs.
8. Review and cross-check your information before submitting the form.

To apply for the reissuance of a lost company PAN card when you already have a copy of the card, follow these steps:

2. Under the "Services" section, click on "PAN" and then choose "Apply" under "Reprint of PAN Card."
