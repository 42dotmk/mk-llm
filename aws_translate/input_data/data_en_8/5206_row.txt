Reasoning and answer: He needs 12 tablespoons of lemon juice for every dozen of cupcakes and he’s making 3 dozen cupcakes so he needs 12 * 3 = 36 tablespoons of lemon juice. 1 lemon provides 4 tablespoons of lemon juice and he needs 36 tablespoons so he will need 36 / 4 = 9 lemons.
The answer: 9

First find the number of times Missy yells at the stubborn dog: 4 * 12 times = 48 times. Then add the number of times she yells at the obedient dog to find the total number of times she yells: 48 times + 12 times = 60 times.
The answer: 60
Reverse engineering the question: Missy has an obedient dog and a stubborn dog. She has to yell at the stubborn dog four times for every one time she yells at the obedient dog. If she yells at the obedient dog 12 times, how many times does she yell at both dogs combined?

Reasoning and answer: 20% of $45 is (20 / 100) * $45 = $9. The price of the textbook in other bookshops cost $9 less than $45 which is $45 - $9 = $36. Three textbooks from the school bookshop would cost $45 * 3 = $135. Three textbooks from another bookshop would cost $36 * 3 = $108. Peter can save $135 - $108 = $27 by buying from another bookshop.
The answer: 27

Question: The price of a math textbook in the school bookshop is $45. If those sold in bookshops outside the school cost 20% less, how much can Peter save by buying from other bookshops rather than the school's if he wants to buy 3 math textbooks?

Lisa spends $40 on t - shirts / 2 = $20 on jeans. She also spends $40 on t - shirts * 2 = $80 on coats. So Lisa has spent a total of 40 + 20 + 80 = $140. Carly spends $40 / 4 = $10 on t - shirts. She also spends $20 per pair of jeans * 3 = $60 on jeans. She then also spends $80 Lisa’s cost for coats / 4 = $20 on coats. So Carly has spent a total of 10 + 60 + 20 = $90. Lisa and Carly have therefore spent a total of 140 + 90 = $230.
The answer: 230
Reverse engineering the question: Lisa and Carly go shopping together. Lisa spends $40 on t-shirts then spends half of this amount on jeans and twice this amount on coats. Carly spends only a quarter as much as Lisa on t-shirts but spends 3 times as much on jeans and a quarter of the amount Lisa spent on coats. In dollars, how much did Lisa and Carly spend in total?

Reasoning and answer: First find the total time Mary's trip takes: 630 feet / 90 feet / minute = 7 minutes. Then find the total time Ann's trip takes: 800 feet / 40 feet / minute = 20 minutes. Then subtract Mary's time from Ann's time to find the difference: 20 minutes - 7 minutes = 13 minutes.
The answer: 13

Question: Mary and Ann are going sledding. Mary slides down a hill that's 630 feet long at a speed of 90 feet/minute. Ann slides down a hill that's 800 feet long at a rate of 40 feet/minute. How much longer does Ann's trip take than Mary?

Reasoning and answer: First find the number of tablespoons in a full cup: 8 tablespoons / half - cup * 2 half - cups / cup = 16 tablespoons. Then find the total number of teaspoons in a cup: 16 tablespoons / cup * 3 teaspoons / tablespoon = 48 teaspoons. Then find the number of grains of rice per teaspoon: 480 grains / 48 teaspoons = 10 grains / teaspoon.
The answer: 10
