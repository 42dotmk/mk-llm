Question: Kevin's fish tank was leaking slowly at a rate of 1.5 ounces per hour. He planned to go to the fish tank store later that day to get a new tank, but it may be as long as 12 hours before he can return home with the new tank. Therefore, to collect the leaking fluid over that time, he placed a bucket underneath the tank that could hold twice the amount of fluid that would leak over 12 hours. What size bucket, in ounces, did he use?
Answer: Over 12 hours, a leak of 1.5 ounces per hour for 12 hours would generate 1.5 * 12 = 18 ounces. A bucket that can hold twice the volume leaked is 18 * 2 = 36 ounces. The answer is 36.
[Question]A couple agreed to split their expenses equally, including the salary of their house help. While doing her job, the house help had an accident; thus, she underwent a medical procedure which cost her $128. The couple decided to pay half of the medical expenses and the other half will be deducted from her $160 salary. If the husband paid for the entire half of the hospital bill, how much does he still need to pay so that they split the expenses for the house help equally?
[Answer]The amount that the couple would cover for the hospital bill is $128 / 2 = $64. The couple's total expenses (salary and hospital bill) is $160 + $64 = $224. So each of them should give $224 / 2 = $112 in total. Since the husband paid the entire half of the hospital bill already ($64), he still needs to pay $112 - $64 = $48. The answer is 48.
Q: Andy is making fudge. First he needs to raise the temperature of the candy mixture from 60 degrees to 240 degrees. Then he needs to cool it down to 170 degrees. If the candy heats at 5 degrees/minute and cools at 7 degrees/minute, how long will it take for the candy to be done (in minutes)?
A: First find the total number of degrees the candy needs to heat up: 240 degrees - 60 degrees = 180 degrees. Then divide that amount by the rate the candy heats up: 180 degrees / 5 degrees / minute = 36 minutes. Then find the number of degrees the candy needs to cool down: 240 degrees - 170 degrees = 70 degrees. Then divide that by the rate the candy cool down: 70 degrees / 7 degrees / minute = 10 minutes. Then add the time for the candy to heat to the time for it to cool to find the total time: 10 minutes + 36 minutes = 46 minutes. The answer is 46.
Question: The capacity of Karson's home library is 400 books. If he currently has 120 books, how many more books does he have to buy to make his library 90% full?
Answer: When 90% full, Karson's library holds 90 / 100 * 400 = 360 books. If he has 120 books in the library now, he needs to buy 360 - 120 = 240 books to make his library 90% full. The answer is 240.
[Question]Eddyâ€™s spider plant produces 2 baby plants 2 times a year. After 4 years, how many baby plants will the mother plant have produced?
[Answer]The mother plant produces 2 baby plants 2 times a year so it produces 2 * 2 = 4 plants a year. It produces 4 plants a year so after 4 years it will produce 4 * 4 = 16 baby plants. The answer is 16.
