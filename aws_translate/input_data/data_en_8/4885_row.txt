Before the person required surgery for their torn cartilage in the right knee, several events and factors might have contributed to the injury and the decision for surgical intervention. Here is a detailed account of possible events leading up to the surgery:

1. Initial Injury: The person may have experienced a traumatic event or participated in an activity that put stress on the knee joint, leading to the tear in the cartilage. This could involve sports, accidents, or a sudden twist or impact on the knee. Common sports that can cause knee injuries include soccer, basketball, skiing, and running.

2. Onset of Symptoms: After the initial injury, the person likely started experiencing symptoms such as pain, swelling, stiffness, and reduced range of motion in the affected knee. They might also have felt a locking or catching sensation when trying to move the joint.

3. Initial Consultation: The individual probably sought medical advice from a healthcare professional due to the persistent symptoms. The physician might have conducted a physical examination, assessed the knee's range of motion, and palpated the joint to identify any abnormalities.

4. Diagnostic Tests: To confirm the diagnosis of torn cartilage, the healthcare professional may have ordered additional imaging tests, such as an X-ray, MRI, or CT scan, to get a detailed view of the knee joint and surrounding structures. This would help determine the extent of the injury and rule out any other possible conditions.

5. Non-Surgical Treatment: In some cases, prior to deciding on surgery, the physician may have recommended conservative treatment options to manage the pain and inflammation, such as rest, ice, compression, elevation (RICE), and over-the-counter pain medications. Additionally, the person might have been advised to use crutches, a knee brace, or participate in physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the knee joint and improve mobility.

6. Evaluation of Treatment Progress: After attempting non-surgical treatment options, the healthcare professional likely assessed the person's progress to determine if the symptoms had improved or if further intervention was required. This might include follow-up appointments, physical examinations, and additional imaging tests.

7. Decision for Surgery: If conservative treatment options failed to alleviate the symptoms or if the cartilage tear was severe, the healthcare professional might have determined that surgery was necessary to repair the damage and prevent further complications. This decision would have been based on factors such as the person's age, activity level, pain tolerance, and overall health.

8. Preoperative Appointment: Prior to surgery, the person would have had a preoperative consultation to discuss the surgical procedure, potential risks and complications, and necessary preparations. The physician may have also ordered preoperative tests, such as blood work, to ensure the individual was fit for surgery.

In summary, the person likely experienced an injury that led to a tear in the cartilage of their right knee. They would have undergone several steps to diagnose the issue and attempt non-surgical treatments before ultimately requiring surgery. During this process, they were prescribed Hydrocodone for pain management but requested an alternative medication due to sleep-related side effects. Consequently, their doctor prescribed Oxycodone following the surgery.
