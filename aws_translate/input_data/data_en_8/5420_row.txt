In a seemingly peaceful small town nestled amongst the hills, a darkness begins to unfold. Residents suddenly find themselves plagued by terrifying nightmares, unexplained accidents, and whispers of unearthly beings. It all leads back to a secret that revolves around one name - "Elise."

People once revered the story as an ancient myth, but now they will come to learn that it is much more than just an urban legend. The town of Fort Greenwall has unknowingly become the breeding ground for a demonic presence seeking to harness the energy from an ancient artifact hidden beneath the town's surface.

Enter Elise (played by Scarlett Johansson), a gifted, yet misunderstood loner with a mysterious past and unique powers. Raised by her grandmother in Fort Greenwall, Elise has experienced a lifetime of being ostracized by the townsfolk for her unusual capabilities. As the demonic forces become stronger, Elise's powers begin to manifest in new and unexpected ways, drawing attention and suspicion from the townsfolk who fear her potential connection to the malevolent presence.

Unbeknownst to Elise, her true lineage is tied to an ancient order of demon hunters, also called "The Protectors," who swore to suppress the threat of the otherworldly artifact. Now, with the death of her grandmother and her own powers awakening, Elise discovers the truth behind her lineage. Under immense pressure, she embraces her destiny and sets out to neutralize the demon's influence.

As the town descends into chaos, Elise forges an unlikely alliance with a local detective, Victor (played by Idris Elba), whose wife and child have fallen victims to the demonic entity. Together, they must unravel the secrets hidden in the town's history and uncover the true intentions behind the demon's presence.

As their journey progresses, the duo encounters other members of the long-lost "Protectors," who are formidable adversaries to the demon and an indispensable resource to Elise. As the team of heroes grows stronger, they discover that the demon's ultimate objective is to unleash an army of demonic creatures to overrun the earth, with Fort Greenwall as the epicenter of this sinister plot.

As they decode the rituals and locate the ancient artifact, Elise delves deeply into her powers, becoming a skilled demon hunter under the guidance of the experienced Protectors. With Victor's unwavering support and her newfound allies, Elise leads the charge against the demonic invasion. Amidst the relentless battle that ensues, Elise must confront her deepest fears and her internal struggles while vanquishing the demon and its army.

In the plot's climax, Elise faces off against the demon's general in a thrilling showdown, where her conviction and determination to protect her town and the world lead her to unlock her true potential.
