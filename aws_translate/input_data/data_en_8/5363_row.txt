Q: If eight movie tickets cost 2 times as much as one football game ticket, and each movie ticket is sold at $30, calculate the total amount of money Chandler will pay if he buys eight movie tickets and five football game tickets.
A: If each movie ticket is sold at $30, the cost of buying eight movie tickets is 8 * $30 = $240. Since eight movie tickets cost 2 times as much as one football game ticket, the cost of buying one football game ticket is $240 / 2 = $120. Buying five football game tickets will cost 5 * $120 = $600. The total cost of buying eight movie tickets and five football game tickets is $600 + $240 = $840. The answer is 840.
Question: They say the first year of a dog's life equals 15 human years. The second year of a dog's life equals 9 human years and after that, every year of a dog's life equals 5 human years. According to this logic, how many human years has my 10-year-old dog lived?
Answer: If your dog is 10 years old then in his first year of life he lived 1 * 15 = 15 human years. In his second year of life, he lived 1 * 9 = 9 human years. We need to calculate his remaining years or 10 - 2 = 8 years of dog life into human years. If 1 year of dog life after the 2 years equates to 5 human years, then 8 years of dog life equals 8 * 5 = 40 human years. In total, your dog has lived 15 + 9 + 40 = 64 human years. The answer is 64.
[Question]Mr. Isaac rides his bicycle at the rate of 10 miles per hour for 30 minutes. If he rides for another 15 miles, rests for 30 minutes, and then covers the remaining distance of 20 miles, what's the total time in minutes took to travel the whole journey?
[Answer]If in one hour he covers 10 miles and rides for 15 miles at the rate of 10 miles per hour, then the time taken for the 15 miles will be 15 / 10 = 1.5 hours. The time in minutes is 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes. The time taken for the remaining 20 miles at a rate of 10 miles per hour is 20 / 10 = 2 hours. The time in minutes is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. The total time taken for the whole journey is the first 30 minutes + 90 + 30 minutes for resting + 120 minutes = 270 minutes. The answer is 270.
Q: Exactly two-fifths of NBA players who signed up for a test are aged between 25 and 35 years. If three-eighths of them are older than 35, and a total of 1000 players signed up, how many players are younger than 25 years?
A: Two - fifths of 1000 players is (2 / 5) * 1000 = 400 players. Three eights of 1000 players is (3 / 8) * 1000 = 375 players. The total number of players 25 or older is 400 + 375 = 775. The number of players younger than 25 years is 1000 - 775 = 225 players. The answer is 225.
Question: Daniel has 5 jars of juice containing 2 liters each. He wants to serve a full glass of juice to each person at a party. He knows that each glass can hold up to 250 milliliters of juice. How many full glasses can he give?
Answer: The total liters of juice he has is 5 jars x 2 liters / jar = 10 liters of juice. Then he needs to convert this amount to milliliters: 10 liters x 1000 milliliters / liter = 10,000 milliliters. He can fill up to 10,000 ml / 250 ml / glass = 40 glasses. The answer is 40.
