Sikkim became a part of the Northeastern region of India on 16 May 1975. The history of Sikkim's integration with India is an intriguing tale of geopolitical factors, diplomatic negotiations, and historical events.

Sikkim, a small Himalayan kingdom, was nestled between Nepal, Tibet (China), and Bhutan. It shared a sensitive strategic location as it bordered the critical Siliguri Corridor (also known as the 'chicken's neck'), which connected mainland India to its northeastern states. Historically, Sikkim was a protectorate under British India. Following India's independence in 1947, Sikkim maintained its protectorate status, but under the Indian government instead of British rule.

In 1950, India and Sikkim signed the Treaty of Perpetual Peace and Friendship, which deepened their relationship. As per this treaty, India was responsible for Sikkim's defense, foreign affairs, and strategic communication, while the Kingdom of Sikkim maintained its autonomy and control over domestic affairs. This arrangement worked reasonably well initially. However, as uncertainties emerged in the geopolitical landscape, events would soon push Sikkim towards union with India.

By the 1970s, several factors contributed to the changing situation in Sikkim. The rising influence of political parties demanding greater democracy and an end to feudal rule, regional tensions after China's annexation of Tibet in the 1950s, and India's defeat in the 1962 border conflict with China generated anxiety in the Indian government. The increasing influence of external forces, particularly from China, further fueled India's concerns.

During this period, Sikkim faced political turmoil, which heightened when the ruling party, the Sikkim National Congress, was defeated in the 1974 general elections. Conflicts arose between the pro-democratic political groups and the Chogyal (King) Palden Thondup Namgyal. In response to these events, and in order to maintain stability, the government of India decided to play an active role in Sikkim's affairs.

In 1974, the Indian government helped draft a new constitution for Sikkim, which led to the establishment of a more democratic political system and reduced the Chogyal's powers significantly. This progress, however, was deemed insufficient for a stable and secure relationship between the two entities.

On April 9, 1975, the Sikkim Assembly passed a resolution to abolish the institution of Chogyal and seek representation in the Indian Parliament. This resolution was supported by a vast majority of the local population. Subsequently, in May 1975, a referendum was held, in which over 97% of the electorate voted in favor of Sikkim's integration with India.

Following the referendum, the Indian government passed the 35th Constitutional Amendment Bill and the 36th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1975, which granted Sikkim the status of the 22nd state of India. It was formally admitted into the Indian Union on midnight of May 15, 1975, and officially became a part of the Northeastern region on May 16, 1975.

In conclusion, Sikkim's journey from a protectorate to the 22nd state of India was shaped by internal political developments, regional tensions, and pragmatic diplomacy between Sikkim and India. The formal integration on May 16, 1975, brought Sikkim into the fold of the Northeastern region of India, strengthening India's strategic standing and contributing to the socio-economic development of the area.
