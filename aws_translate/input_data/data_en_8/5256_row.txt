Q: Janette went camping for 5 days. She brought along 40 pieces of beef jerky. She wants to ration it out so that she can eat 1 for breakfast, 1 for lunch, and 2 for dinner each day. When she returns from the trip, she plans on giving half of the remaining pieces to her brother. How many pieces of beef jerky will she have left once she does this?
A: Each day she eats a total of 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 pieces of jerky. For the entire trip, she will consume a total of 4 * 5 = 20 pieces of jerky. She gives half to her brother, which will leave her a total of 20 / 2 = 10 pieces of jerky. The answer is 10.
Question: A store marks a book 30% above the cost. But during a sale, a 10% discount was given. If the book costs $50, what is the percent profit?
Answer: The store made a $50 x 30 / 100 = $15 profit for selling it 30% above the cost. So, the book was sold for $50 + $15 = $65. During a sale, the bookâ€™s selling price decreased by $65 x 10 / 100 = $6.50. So, the book was sold for $65 - $6.50 = $58.50. There was $58.50 - $50 = $8.50 profit after the discount. Therefore, the percent profit is $8.50 / $50 x 100% = 17%. The answer is 17.
[Question]Laticia knitted 4 pairs of socks for her nephew. She did such a good job that everyone asked her to start selling them. In the first week, she knitted 12 pairs of socks. In the second week, she knitted 4 more pairs than the week before. On the third week, she only knitted half of the total of the first two weeks. In the fourth week, she knitted 3 fewer pairs than the week before. How many pairs of socks did Laticia knit altogether?
[Answer]In the second week, she knitted 12 + 4 = 16 pairs of socks. In the first two weeks, she knitted 12 + 16 = 28 pairs of socks. On the third week, she knitted 28 / 2 = 14 pairs of socks. On the fourth week, she knitted 14 - 3 = 11 pairs of socks. Altogether, Laticia knitted 4 + 12 + 16 + 14 + 11 = 57 pairs of socks. The answer is 57.

Question: Christine and Janice are having a contest to see who can throw a ball the highest. They each get three throws. On her first throw, Christine throws it 20 feet high. Janice's throw is 4 feet lower than Christine's. On their second throw, Christine throws it ten feet higher than her first throw and Janice throws it twice as high as her first throw. On the final throw, Christine throws it 4 feet higher than her 2nd throw while Janice throws it 17 feet higher than Christine's first throw. What is the height of the highest throw?
Answer: We know Christine's second throw was 30 feet high because 20 + 10 = 30. We know Christine's third throw was 34 feet because 30 + 4 = 34. Janice's first throw was 16 feet because 20 - 4 = 16. Janice's second throw was 32 feet because 16 * 2 = 32. Janice's final throw was 37 feet high because 20 + 17 = 37. The six throws were 20 feet, 30 feet, 34 feet, 16 feet, 32 feet, and 37 feet, and of these numbers, 37 feet was the highest. The answer is 37.
