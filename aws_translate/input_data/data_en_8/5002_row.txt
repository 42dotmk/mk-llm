Tennessee becoming a state was a lengthy and intricate process that began long before 1927 Victor recording sessions in Bristol or the rise of the Grand Ole Opry in the 1930s. Understanding the historical context and key events that led to Tennessee's statehood is essential to fully appreciate how it became the 16th state of the United States.

In the mid-18th century, Tennessee was mainly inhabited by various Native American tribes, primarily the Cherokee. European settlers, mainly from the British colonies, moved into the area in search of fertile lands. Initially, these settlers faced strong opposition and resistance from the native tribes, but eventually, they started establishing small frontier settlements. By the 1760s, the region had become a part of the British Province of North Carolina.

The 1770s saw a series of developments that further shifted the geopolitical landscape in Tennessee. The Transylvania Purchase in 1775 led to an increase in the number of settlers and territorial disputes among the British, the native tribes, and colonial pioneers. Throughout the 1780s, the area that now encompasses Tennessee gained more autonomy but was still part of North Carolina.

In 1784, the residents of the region east of the Appalachian Mountains, known as the Watauga Association, attempted to secede from North Carolina and form a separate state called "Franklin." However, this proposal to create the State of Franklin was not approved by the Continental Congress, and the movement ultimately failed.

After the signing of the United States Constitution in 1787, the Southwest Territory was established. This territory included the area west of the Appalachian Mountains, which comprises modern-day Tennessee. President George Washington appointed William Blount, a native of North Carolina, as the governor of the Southwest Territory in 1790.

Governor Blount worked closely with the settlers and native tribes, helping to establish a peaceful relationship between them. He oversaw the treaty negotiations that led to the Treaty of Holston (White's Fort) in 1791, which established formal borders between the Cherokee Nation and the Southwest Territory. With the borders in place, the population in the territory grew significantly, reaching a level appropriate to pursue statehood.

In the summer of 1795, Governor Blount called for a constitutional convention and tasked delegates to draft a state constitution. The convention produced the Tennessee Constitution, which included provisions like popularly elected governors, a bicameral legislature, and a bill of rights.

With the new constitution in place, Tennessee's statehood proposal was sent to Congress. On June 1, 1796, the United States Congress admitted Tennessee into the Union as the 16th state. This marked the first instance of a new state being admitted under the process outlined in the U.S. Constitution.

In conclusion, Tennessee's journey to becoming a state involved various factors like European settlement, territorial conflicts, governance under the Southwest Territory, and negotiation of treaties with native tribes. The process culminated with the drafting of the Tennessee Constitution and its admission to the Union on June 1, 1796. The development and growth of country music and the influence of the Grand Ole Opry, which came much later, would significantly contribute to the cultural identity of the state, but was not related to its admission as a state.
