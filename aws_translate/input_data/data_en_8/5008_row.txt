Title: Bristol Academy Suffers Crushing Defeat to Frankfurt in Women's Champions League Semi-Final Clash

Bristol Academy's dreams of reaching the Women's Champions League semi-finals were shattered as they suffered a resounding 12-0 defeat on aggregate to German powerhouse, Frankfurt. The loss marks a disappointing end to a promising campaign for Bristol Academy, as the relentless Frankfurt side demonstrated their superior skill throughout the two-legged encounter.

In the first leg of the competition held at Ashton Gate, Bristol was overwhelmed by the German side's prowess as they conceded an agonizing five goals. Bristol Academy was unable to respond to the goals scored by Frankfurt's exceptional offense, led by their talented striker Célia Šašić, who netted three goals in the first leg. The home fans left the stadium devastated, as they knew their team's chances of progressing to the semi-finals had become remote.

The second leg of the tie took place at Frankfurt's Commerzbank-Arena, where thousands of passionate Frankfurt fans showed their support for the Frauen-Bundesliga champions. Bristol Academy, determined to give their best and restore some pride, knew that a remarkable fightback would be required to overturn the five-goal deficit of the first leg.

As the match began, Bristol attempted to take the game to their opponents, showing good organization and determination in the initial stages. However, Frankfurt's superior experience and quality soon emerged as they overpowered the English side. Mandy Islacker opened the scoring for Frankfurt, swiftly followed by Marith Prießen, Saskia Bartusiak, and the in-form Šašić adding to their tally. 

Bristol was unable to match the intensity, skill and tactical discipline of the reigning European champions who continued their ruthless strategy and extended their lead with goals from Simone Laudehr, Lise Munk, and Australian international Emily van Egmond. The game ended with a staggering 7-0 victory for Frankfurt in the second leg, taking the aggregate score to 12-0.

Despite this overwhelming loss, Bristol Academy has much to be proud of in their Women's Champions League campaign. As the only English club to reach the quarter-final stage in the current season, they fought bravely against some of the top teams in Europe, including Barcelona and Austrian outfit St. Pölten. Manager Tanya Oxtoby and her players have undoubtedly gained valuable international experience, and they will strive to use this as a springboard to greater success in the future.

For Frankfurt, this resounding victory sees them advance to the semi-finals of the Women's Champions League, where they will face French giants Lyon or Danish side Brøndby IF. The German side will be confident of their chances, as they aim to add another European trophy to their ever-growing collection. With an array of talent within their ranks and momentum on their side, Frankfurt remains a formidable force in the competition and a genuine contender to lift the prestigious trophy in May.

In conclusion, Bristol Academy's journey in the Women's Champions League was brought to an abrupt end by a dominant Frankfurt side. Nevertheless, there are positives to be taken from their campaign, and the experience will surely prove invaluable as they look to build and improve in the coming seasons. Meanwhile, Frankfurt marches on to the semi-finals, fully focused on their quest to secure the European crown once more.
