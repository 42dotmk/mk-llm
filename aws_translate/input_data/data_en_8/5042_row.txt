Reasoning and answer: If a paint mixer takes three days to make 18 drums of paint in a day, he makes 18 / 3 = 6 drums of paint. The number of days it will take for him to make 360 drums of paint, making 6 drums a day, is 360 / 6 = 60 days.
The answer: 60

The frame she initially intended to buy was 20 / 100 * $60 = $12 more expensive than she had thought. This means the frame was being sold at $60 + $12 = $72. If she paid for a smaller frame at 3 / 4 the price of the frame she initially intended to buy, she paid 3 / 4 * $72 = $54. Yvette remained with $60 - $54 = $6.
The answer: 6
Reverse engineering the question: Yvette wants to frame a new picture. When she goes to her local frame shop, she finds out that the frame she wanted is 20% more expensive than her budget of $60. If she paid for a smaller frame at 3/4 the new price of the frame she initially intended to buy, how much money did she remain with?

Reasoning and answer: He spends 5 * 2 = $10 on Wednesday to pay for a movie ticket. He spends 5 * 5 = $25 on Saturday to pay for a movie ticket. He spends a total of 10 + 25 = $35.

Since the average of marks scored in four tests by Jake was 75, the total marks that he scored in the four tests are 4 * 75 = 300. If jake scored 80 marks in the first test and 10 more in the second test, he scored 80 + 10 = 90 marks in the second test. The combined marks for the first and the second test is 90 + 80 = 170. The total marks Jake scored in the third and fourth test is 300 - 170 = 130. Since Jake scored an equal number of marks in the third and fourth tests, he scored 130 / 2 = 65 marks in each of the third and fourth tests.
The answer: 65
Reverse engineering the question: The average of marks scored in four tests by Jake was 75. If jake scored 80 marks in the first test and 10 more in the second test, and an equal number of marks in the third and fourth test, calculate the marks he scored in the third test.

Reasoning and answer: He knows 50 people are showing up and he’s hoping 40 more people will drop in for a total of 50 + 40 = 90 people. He’s made 10 extravagant gift bags and 20 average bags for a total of 10 + 20 = 30 bags. He hopes 90 people will show up and has already made 30 bags so he needs to make 90 - 30 = 60 more gift bags.
The answer: 60

Reasoning and answer: The total percentage the class needs to get is 18.75 because 25 x .75 = 18.75. The total percentage the class has absent the one student is 18.48. The lowest the absent student can get and still have a pizza party is 27% because (18.75 - 18.48)x 100 = 27.
The answer: 27
