In the context provided, the term "crossed over" refers to indie songs and artists that have gained significant popularity not just within their original indie rock genre, but also within the broader adult contemporary music scene. This transition for these artists means they managed to appeal to a wider audience, moving beyond their initial niche fan base and experiencing a surge in popularity and commercial success.

Since the mid-2000s, several indie bands and musicians have successfully crossed over to the adult contemporary charts, garnering attention from a more diverse group of listeners. The mainstreaming of bands such as Wilco and Feist demonstrated an increasing interest in indie rock from adult contemporary enthusiasts. Simultaneously, this crossover has resulted in the blending of the two genres, creating a smoother, more accessible sound that caters to a wider range of music fans.

In the early 2010s, this trend continued as more indie musicians and bands ventured into the adult contemporary territory. Notable artists during this time include Imagine Dragons, Mumford & Sons, Of Monsters & Men, The Lumineers, and Ed Sheeran. These artists managed to create music that resonated with both their original fan base and the broader adult contemporary audience.

A few factors have contributed to this phenomenon:

1. Evolving musical tastes: As the music landscape has evolved, so too have listeners' tastes. Fans of adult contemporary music have become more open to incorporating alternative sounds and styles, and this has allowed indie musicians to find their footing in this realm.

2. Streaming platforms: The rise of music streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music has played a significant role in the crossover of indie songs into adult contemporary charts. These platforms provide tailored playlists and recommendations, making it easier for listeners to discover new music across genres.

3. Collaborations: Cross-genre collaborations have become increasingly common, allowing indie artists to work with established musicians from the adult contemporary scene. These collaborations have resulted in the creation of more accessible, genre-blending music that caters to a wide range of listeners.

4. Marketing: Indie artists and their record labels have embraced new marketing strategies to promote their music to broader audiences. Social media have made it easier for artists to connect directly with their fans and build a loyal following. This connectivity has, in turn, exposed their music to new listeners, enabling indie songs to cross over into the adult contemporary charts.

5. Live performances: Live music festivals and concerts often bring together diverse lineups of artists across various genres. As indie musicians share the stage with adult contemporary artists, their music is introduced to a wider audience and is more likely to experience crossover success.

In summary, the crossover of indie songs to the adult contemporary charts has been the result of several factors, including evolving musical tastes, the rise of streaming platforms, cross-genre collaborations, strategic marketing, and exposure through live performances. As the boundaries between genres continue to blur, artists like Imagine Dragons, Mumford & Sons, Of Monsters & Men, The Lumineers, and Ed Sheeran have become representative of a new musical era where adult contemporary and indie rock can coexist harmoniously.
