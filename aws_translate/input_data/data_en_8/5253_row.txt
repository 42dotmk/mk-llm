Genre: Thriller/Drama

Plot:

In the quaint, picturesque village of St. Miles, nestled among majestic mountains, life moves at a slow and peaceful pace. The villagers are kind, hospitable, and deeply religious, gathering at their beloved church every Sunday to seek solace and guidance from Father Cyril. Little do they know their idyllic world of simplicity and peace is about to be turned upside down by an unknown terror lurking in the shadows of the dense forest that surrounds their village.

The movie begins with the mysterious and gruesome death of a local shepherd, Adrian, whose torn apart body is discovered on the outskirts of the woods. Fearful gossip spreads like wildfire among the villagers, and suspicions begin to rise about the presence of a wolf which may have wandered down from the mountains. Mayor Renaud implements a strict curfew and warns all villagers to avoid venturing near the forest.

As panic starts to grip the village, the bloodshed continues, each attack growing closer and closer to the village's heart. The villagers, desperate to put an end to the bloodbath, form search parties to hunt down the wolf. Father Cyril, a calm and rational man, insists that the villagers remain calm and seek refuge and protection in their faith and the sanctity of the church.

One fateful night, as the village gathers for their traditional festive feast, the unimaginable happens. The wolf attacks the village square, sending terrified villagers fleeing into the night. In the midst of the chaos, the church doors are flung open, and Father Cyril, with his arms wide, invites the villagers inside, promising safety within the church's divine sanctuary.

As the church fills with people, the village's hunter, Leon, and his hunting party take it upon themselves to confront the wolf and protect their community. Armed with torches and weapons, they venture into the darkness, determined to hunt down the beast. Meanwhile, inside the church, Father Cyril attempts to inspire faith and hope in his fearful flock, beseeching them to remain united in prayer.

As the evening progresses, a storm begins to brew outside, leaving the hunters' mission even more treacherous. Just when it seems the wolf may remain beyond their reach, Leon is able to track it down and inflict a fatal wound. His victory, however, comes at a terrifying cost as, during the wolf's dying moments, it transforms into a man. Shocked and unsettled, the hunters soon discover the truth - the wolf is not an ordinary beast, but a werewolf who has terrorized the village for ages.

Word of the shocking revelation spreads. When brought to light, it becomes clear that the werewolf is none other than Father Cyril's estranged, long-lost brother Edgar, presumed dead years ago. Confronted with this horrifying truth, Father Cyril is left broken and anguished, filled with regret for not recognizing the signs of his brother's dark affliction.

The movie ends with the villagers coming to terms with their horrifying ordeal. Through unity and forgiveness, they find strength in each other and renew their faith, aiming to rebuild their once-peaceful village. Father Cyril, though forever scarred by the traumatic events, vows to carry on with his mission to lead the community in their spiritual journey. And as the mysterious forest continues to conceal its secrets, St. Miles remains a testament to the power of faith and community in overcoming unspeakable darkness.
