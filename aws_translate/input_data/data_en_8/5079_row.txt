The hypothesis, "It's too bad you've never been fishing," is not entailed by the premise, which is asking about the type of bait used for crappie and bass. The premise simply conveys a desire to know the appropriate choice of bait for these two fish species, and does not necessarily suggest that the individual has no prior experience with fishing. 

Now, to answer the question about bait for crappie and bass, let's dive into the details.

Fishing for crappie and bass requires knowledge of their behavior and preferred habitats, as well as understanding the most effective bait types for each species. Although different baits may be used successfully for both fish, there are some baits that tend to perform better for each species.

For crappie:
Crappie are generally more active and found in larger numbers near underwater structures, such as submerged trees, vegetation, and even sunken artificial habitats. They primarily feed on smaller fish, insects, and crustaceans. Here are some popular bait options for crappie fishing:

1. Live Minnows: Live minnows are one of the most popular and effective baits for crappie, as they are an essential part of their natural diet. Rigging a live minnow beneath a slip bobber or using a jighead can yield excellent results.

2. Jigs: Small jigs in various colors and styles can also be highly effective for crappie. Colors like chartreuse, black, and white tend to work well, but it's essential to experiment with different color patterns and jigging motions to find the most successful combination.

3. Insect imitations: Crappie may also be enticed by artificial lures that imitate insects and small aquatic invertebrates. Soft plastic lures like tube baits, grubs, and shad tails often prove fruitful, as do small spinners and beetle spins.

For bass:
Bass are aggressive predators that are attracted to a wide variety of bait, depending on their mood and environmental conditions. Commonly found in areas with cover and structure, they prey on smaller fish, crawfish, and insects. Some popular bait choices for bass fishing include:

1. Soft Plastic Lures: Soft plastic lures like worms, craws, and creature baits are among the most versatile and effective baits for bass fishing. Texas-rigged soft plastics work great in heavy cover, while a Carolina-rigged worm can be the go-to setup in open water environments.

2. Crankbaits: Crankbaits mimic the movement and vibration of small fish in the water, attracting bass and provoking strikes. They come in various diving depths and colors, which should be chosen based on the current fishing environment and conditions.

3. Spinnerbaits and chatterbaits: These baits combine an attractive flash from a spinning blade with the added enticement of a soft plastic trailer that wiggles and swims like an injured prey. They work exceptionally well in areas with dense vegetation and underwater structures, where other lures might become snagged.

4. Topwater lures: Topwater lures like poppers, frogs, and walkers create commotion on the water's surface and can incite violent, explosive strikes from bass, especially during early morning and late evening hours.

In conclusion, the best bait for crappie and bass will largely depend on the specific environment, the time of day, and the prevalent prey species in the area. Good angling practices dictate that you experiment with different bait options to determine which combination works best in each situation.
