While the specific statement, "Universities began systematic training of physicians around the years 1220 in Italy" is accurate to some degree in terms of formal medical education, it is not a reasonable answer to the question about who invented medicine first. The practice of medicine predates any systematic training, and the history of its invention cannot be attributed to just one individual or civilization. 

The advent of medicine spans across many cultures and historical eras. While it is difficult to pinpoint the first person to invent medicine, we can trace its origins back to various ancient societies that laid the groundwork for the development and evolution of medicine as we know it today. 

1. Prehistoric medicine: It is believed that prehistoric humans used basic forms of medicine, such as herbs and natural remedies, to treat injuries, ailments, and diseases. These forms of medicine were typically derived from observing the behavior of animals and relying on trial and error.

2. Traditional medicine in ancient civilizations: Medicine existed in various forms across ancient civilizations, including ancient Egypt, Sumer, China, and India. Medical practitioners in these societies used a mix of religious beliefs, traditional knowledge, and empirical observations to treat illnesses and diseases.

3. Ancient Greek medicine: The first significant source of systematic medical knowledge comes from ancient Greece, with notable names such as Hippocrates and Galen. Hippocrates (460 - 370 BCE), often referred to as the "Father of Medicine," was one of the first to promote the idea of basing medical treatments on rational thought and observation. He is best known for creating the Hippocratic Oath, a code of ethics that still guides modern medical practice.

4. Ancient Roman medicine: The Romans adopted and adapted much of Greek medical knowledge and developed their own systems of public health, hospitals, and medical education. Galen (129 - 200 CE) was a Roman physician who made significant contributions to anatomy, physiology, and pharmacology and is considered one of the most influential figures in medical history.

5. Islamic Golden Age medicine: During the Islamic Golden Age (8th - 13th centuries), significant advancements were made in medicine and pharmacy. Key figures like Al-Razi (854 - 925 CE) and Ibn Sina (Avicenna; 980 - 1037 CE) produced encyclopedic works on medicine that became foundational texts throughout the Islamic world and Western Europe.

Coming back to the statement in question, "Universities began systematic training of physicians around the years 1220 in Italy," it is true that medical education became formalized during the Middle Ages, particularly in European universities. The first university to establish a program focused on the study of medicine was the University of Bologna in 1219, followed by several others such as the University of Padua and the University of Montpellier. However, this development pertains to the organization of medical education, not the invention of medicine itself.

In conclusion, the first invention of medicine predates the Italian universities mentioned in the statement and involves the collective knowledge of countless individuals and societies over thousands of years. The question of who invented medicine first is complex and multifaceted, with roots in prehistory and major contributions from various ancient civilizations and periods during human history.
