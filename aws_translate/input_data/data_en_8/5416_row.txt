Question: Marie is planning to buy a new cash register for her bakery that costs $1040. Every day Marie sells 40 loaves of bread for $2 each and 6 cakes for $12 each. She has to pay $20 each day for rent and $2 each day for electricity. How many days' worth of profits will it take for Marie to pay for the cash register?
Answer: First figure out how much money Marie makes from selling bread each day by multiplying the number of loaves sold by the price per loaf: 40 loaves * $2 / loaf = $80. Next figure out how much money Marie makes from selling cakes each day by multiplying the number of cakes sold by the price per cake: 6 cakes * $12 / cake = $72. Now add the money from selling the bread to the money from selling the cakes to find Marie's total daily income: $80 + $72 = $152. Next subtract Marie's daily expenses from her daily income to find her daily profit: $152 - $20 - $2 = $130. Finally, divide the price of the cash register by Marie's daily profit to find how many days' profits she needs to pay for it: $1040 / $130 = 8. The answer is 8.

Q: Lily got a new puppy for her birthday. She was responsible for feeding the puppy 1/4 cup of food three times a day for two weeks starting tomorrow. For the following 2 weeks, Lily will feed him 1/2 cup of food twice a day. She has fed him 1/2 cup of food today. Including today, how much food will the puppy eat over the next 4 weeks?
A: 1 week has 7 days so 2 weeks will have 2 * 7 = 14 days. The puppy will eat 1 / 4c three times a day so .25 * 3 = .75 cups per day. The puppy will eat .75 cups of food a day for 14 days for a total of .75 * 14 = 10.5 cups. The puppy will then eat `.5 cup of food twice a day so .5 * 2 = 1 cup per day. The puppy will eat 1 cup of food a day for 14 days for a total of 1 * 14 = 14 cups per day. She has already fed him .5 cup of food and he will eat 10.5 cups and another 14 cups for a total of .5 + 10.5 + 14 = 25 cups of food. The answer is 25.
Question: Cheyenne is a craftswoman making pots for sale. On a particular week, she made 80 clay pots. However, when she put them in the sun to dry, 2/5 of the pots cracked and could not be sold. How much money did Cheyenne make from selling the remaining items at $40 per clay pot?
Answer: When she put them in the sun to dry, 2 / 5 * 80 = 32 of the clay pots that Cheyenne made cracked and could not be sold. The number of pots that were good for sale is 80 - 32 = 48. If she sold each clay pot at $40, she earned $40 * 48 = $1920 from selling the good pots. The answer is 1920.
[Question]Andy walks 50 meters from his house to school. After school, he comes back to the house and goes to the market. If he walks 140 meters in total, how many meters is the distance between the house and the market?
[Answer]He walks 50m from home to school and walks 50m again from school to house, so he walks 50m + 50m = 100 meters. If the total distance is 140m, the distance between the house and the market is 140m - 100m = 40 meters. The answer is 40.
