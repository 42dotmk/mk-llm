The two questions you have asked are related but not the same. Let's address them one by one.

1. Is gravity of the earth constant?

Gravity is generally considered constant for most practical purposes on Earth; however, the strength of Earth's gravity is not perfectly uniform everywhere on the planet's surface. The standard value of gravity on Earth's surface, known as standard gravity, is approximately 9.80665 meter per second squared (m/s²). This value is an average and serves as a convenient reference.

That being said, Earth's gravity varies slightly depending on several factors:

a. Altitude: As you move further from Earth's center, the gravitational force decreases. Hence, gravity is weaker at high altitudes compared to sea level.

b. Latitude: Earth is not a perfect sphere but an oblate spheroid. This means that it is slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the Equator. As a result, gravity is slightly stronger at the poles (around 9.832 m/s²) and weaker at the Equator (around 9.780 m/s²).

c. Local geology: The density and composition of rocks and other materials in the Earth's crust affect the local gravitational force. For example, denser materials like iron ore will cause a slight increase in local gravity, while less dense materials will cause a decrease.

In summary, Earth's gravity is not entirely constant, but the variations are small enough that they usually do not have a significant impact on everyday life.

2. What would happen if Earth’s gravity were to double?

If Earth's gravity were to suddenly double, various consequences would occur for both the planet itself and the life on its surface:

a. Increased weight: Objects and people would experience twice the force pulling them towards the center of the Earth. This would make it much harder to move or lift objects, affecting our ability to perform tasks and engage in physical activities. The human body and other living organisms would also experience immense stress due to the increased pressure on bones, muscles, and internal organs.

b. Atmospheric pressure: Increased gravity would cause the Earth's atmosphere to become denser, leading to higher air pressure on the surface. This could lead to potential respiratory issues for living organisms and alter the weather patterns and climate.

c. Ocean behavior: The higher gravitational force would affect ocean tides, causing them to become more extreme. Additionally, sea levels might drop as water would be pulled towards the Earth's center more strongly.

d. Geological activity: A higher gravity would increase the pressure on Earth's crust, potentially leading to more frequent and powerful earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

e. Structural integrity: Buildings, bridges, and other infrastructure would be subjected to increased forces, possibly leading to collapse or the need to reinforce existing structures.

f. Ecosystems: The sudden increase in gravity could heavily impact ecosystems, especially on organisms that have evolved under the current gravitational conditions. Flying creatures, like birds and insects, would have difficulty adapting to the new conditions, and many species could face extinction.

In conclusion, while the two questions are related in terms of their focus on Earth's gravity, they are not the same. The first question addresses the uniformity of Earth's gravity, while the second explores the consequences of a sudden doubling of Earth's gravity.
