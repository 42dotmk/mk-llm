[Question]Heisenberg owns a pharmacy. He earned a total of $80 from 100 mg amoxicillin and $60 from 500 mg amoxicillin every week. If each capsule of 100 mg amoxicillin costs $5 and each capsule of 500 mg amoxicillin costs $2, how many capsules of amoxicillin does he sell every 2 weeks?
[Answer]Heisenberg sells a total of $80 / 5 = 16 capsules of 100 mg amoxicillin every week. So, the total number of 100 mg amoxicillin he sells every 2 weeks is 16 x 2 = 32. And he sells $60 / 2 = 30 capsules of 500 mg amoxicillin every week. So, the total number of 500 mg amoxicillin he sells every 2 weeks is 30 x 2 = 60. Therefore, the total number of capsules he sells every 2 weeks is 60 + 32 = 92. The answer is 92.
Q: After tests in California, the total number of Coronavirus cases was recorded as 2000 positive cases on a particular day. The number of cases increased by 500 on the second day, with 50 recoveries. On the third day, the total number of new cases spiked to 1500 with 200 recoveries. What's the total number of positive cases after the third day?
A: When 500 new cases were recorded after the tests, the total number of positive cases increased to 2000 cases + 500 cases = 2500 cases. With 50 recoveries, the total number of cases reduced to 2500 cases - 50 cases = 2450 cases. On the third day, with 1500 new cases, the total number of cases became 2450 cases + 1500 cases = 3950 cases. If 200 people recovered from the virus, the total number of people with Coronavirus became 3950 cases - 200 cases = 3750 cases. The answer is 3750.
Question: Kenny wants to make sure he does more jumping jacks every week than he did the week before. He recorded that last week he did 324 total jumping jacks. On Saturday of this week, he looks at his records and sees that on Sunday he did 34. On Monday he did 20. On Tuesday he skipped a day. On Wednesday he did 123. On Thursday he did 64. On Friday he did 23. How many does he have to do on Saturday to make sure he beats last week's number?
Answer: He has already done 264 this week because 34 + 20 + 123 + 64 + 23 = 264. If he does 60 he will have done as many as last week because 324 - 264 = 60. He has to do 61 on Saturday because 60 + 1 = 61. The answer is 61.
[Question]Troy's home is 75 meters away from school while Emily's home is 98 meters away from school. Troy and Emily walk to school and back home every day. How much farther does Emily walk to school and back in five days?
[Answer]Troy walks to school and back home for a total of 75 x 2 = 150 meters every day. Emily walks to school and back home for a total of 98 x 2 = 196 meters every day. So Emily walks 196 - 150 = 46 meters farther than Troy every day. In five days, Emily walks 46 x 5 = 230 meters farther. The answer is 230.
Q: Ken had fifty pencils, and he wanted to share some of them with his two friends, Manny and Nilo. Ken gave ten pencils to Manny and ten more pencils to Nilo than he gave to Manny. He kept the rest of the pencils. How many pencils did Ken keep?
