[Question]A company has a tank that is already filled at a maximum capacity of 350,000 gallons of water. One day the tank starts losing 32,000 gallons/hour for 5 hours, after that time the company repaired the tank but it wasn't enough because the tank was still losing 10,000 gallons/hour. It stayed like that for 10 hours. In the second attempt, they managed to repair the tank and started filling it with 40,000 gallons/hour. After 3 hours, how many gallons are missing for the tank to be at maximum capacity again?
[Answer]In the first 5 hours the tank losses 32000 gallons / hour x 5 hours = 160000 gallons. In the next 10 hours the tank losses 10,000 gallons / hour x 10 hours = 100000 gallons. The total amount of water loss so far is 100000 + 160000 = 260000 gallons. The total amount of water remaining in the tank is 350000 - 260000 = 90000 gallons. Once repaired, after 3 hours, the tank gains 40000 gallons / hour x 3 hours = 120000 gallons. The total amount of water in the tank after the tank is filled for 3 hours is 120000 + 90000 = 210000 gallons. The amount of water missing in the tank for it to be full is 350000 - 210000 = 140000 gallons. The answer is 140000.
Q: Carly had 42 lollipops to share with her friends. Half of the lollipops were cherry, and the rest were equal amounts of watermelon, sour apple, and grape. How many lollipops were grape?
A: Of her 42 lollipops, half were cherry, so 42 lollipops / 2 = 21 were not cherry. Of the 21 that were not cherry, 1 / 3 of them were grape, so 21 lollipops / 3 = 7 grape lollipops. The answer is 7.
Question: On Monday, a restaurant sells forty dinners. On Tuesday, it sells 40 more dinners than it did Monday. On Wednesday, it sells half the amount of dinners it sold on Tuesday. On Thursday they changed their recipe, and then sold 3 more dinners than they did on Wednesday. How many dinners were sold in those 4 days?
Answer: On Tuesday the restaurant sells 40 + 40 = 80 dinners. On Wednesday the restaurant sells 80 / 2 = 40 dinners. On Thursday the restaurant sells 40 + 3 = 43 dinners. In those 4 days, the restaurant sells a total of 40 + 80 + 40 + 43 = 203 dinners. The answer is 203.
[Question]A jar full of marbles is sitting on a table. Half of the marbles are blue, a quarter of them are red, 27 of them are green, and 14 of them are yellow. How many marbles are in the jar?
[Answer]Let x = the number of marbles in the jar. If 50% of the marbles are blue, and 25% of them are red, then the remaining 25% must be either green or yellow. So 0.25 * x = 27 green marbles + 14 yellow marbles = 41 marbles. So there are a total of 4 * 41 = 164 marbles in the jar. The answer is 164.
Q: Mr. Willson worked on making his furniture for 3/4 an hour on Monday. On Tuesday, he worked for half an hour. Then he worked for 2/3 an hour on Wednesday and 5/6 of an hour on Thursday. If he worked for 75 minutes on Friday, how many hours in all did he work from Monday to Friday?
A: Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, then Mr. Willson worked for 60 minutes x 3 / 4 = 45 minutes on Monday. He worked for 60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes on Tuesday. He worked for 60 minutes x 2 / 3 = 40 minutes on Wednesday. He worked for 60 minutes x 5 / 6 = 50 minutes on Thursday. So Mr. Willson worked for 45 + 30 + 40 + 50 + 75 = 240 minutes. In hours, it is equal to 240 / 60 = 4 hours. The answer is 4.
