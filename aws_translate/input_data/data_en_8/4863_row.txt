Question: Lizzy had $30. She loaned out $15 to her friend. How much will Lizzy have if her friend returned the money with an interest of 20%?
Answer: Initially, Lizzy had $30; she loaned out $15 so she has $30 - $15 = $15 left. Her friend is returning the $15 with 20% interest for a total of $15 + ($15 * (20 / 100)) = $18. Lizzy will now have $15 + $18 = $33. The answer is 33.

Q: Calen originally had 5 more pencils than does Caleb, and Caleb has 3 less than twice as many pencils as does Candy. If Calen lost 10 pencils, which left him with 10 pencils, then how many pencils does Candy have?
A: If Calen lost 10 pencils, which left him with 10 pencils, then Calen originally had 10 + 10 = 20 pencils. Calen originally had 5 more pencils than does Caleb, and thus Caleb has 20 - 5 = 15 pencils. Let's let "x" represent the number of pencils owned by Candy. Since Caleb has 3 less than twice as many pencils as does Candy, then (2 * x) - 3 = 15. This simplifies to 2 * x = 18. Thus, the number of pencils owned by Candy is x = 9 pencils. The answer is 9.
Question: Lefty scores 20 points in a game and his teammate Righty scores half as many as Lefty does. Their other teammate scores 6 times as much as Righty does. What are the average points scored per player on the team?
Answer: First, we need to determine how many points Righty scored. To do this we perform 20 / 2 = 10 points since Righty scored half as many as Lefty did. Then, to find the other teammate's points we perform 10 * 6 = 60 points scored, as they scored 6 times as many as Righty did. We then add all three teammates' points together, performing 20 + 10 + 60 = 90 points as the first step towards finding the average. We then divide this sum by the total number of players we're averaging, getting 90 / 3 = 30 points per player. The answer is 30.
[Question]Last month, a factory made 12000 dolls and their associated accessories. The accessories for each doll included 2 shoes, 3 bags, 1 set of cosmetics, and 5 hats. If each doll took 45 seconds to make and each accessory took 10 seconds to make, what was the total combined machine operation time, in seconds, required to manufacture all of the dolls and their accessories?
[Answer]The number of shoes the factory made was 12000 dolls x 2 shoes / doll = 24000 shoes. The factory also made for each doll 12000 dolls x 3 bags / doll = 36000 bags. The set of cosmetics made for each doll was just one, so there are 12000 cosmetics sets. Finally, the number of hats for the dolls was 12000 dolls x 5 hats / doll = 60000 hats. In total, the number of accessories was 24000 + 36000 + 12000 + 60000 = 132000 accessories. The dolls took in total 12000 dolls x 45 seconds / doll = 540000 seconds to be made. All the accessories also took 132000 accessories x 10 seconds / accessory = 1320000 seconds. Combing both results, we have that the total time the machinery was working was 1320000 + 540000 = 1860000 seconds. The answer is 1860000.
