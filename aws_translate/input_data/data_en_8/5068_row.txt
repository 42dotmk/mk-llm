One day, the family receives a call from a distant relative, Uncle Frank. Frank is a peculiar old man with a taste for adventure and a mysterious past. He announces plans to visit the family, much to their surprise, but they decide to welcome him with open arms. Upon arrival, Frank shares thrilling stories from his past travels, and the family grows fond of him.

A few days into his visit, Frank is found dead in his room. Autopsy reveals that he died from natural causes due to his frail health and old age. The news spreads, and a formal funeral is planned for two days later. As they prepare for the funeral, they receive an unexpected call from an unknown individual who claims to be an old friend of Frank searching for a missing artifact that the late uncle had possession of. Sensing the potential dangers involving the mysterious artifact, the family decides they must find the object before the unknown caller does.

With only two days until Frank's funeral, the family decides to hide his dead body within their house, dealing with the unpleasant results of decomposition. Between all four members of the family, they take turns keeping watch over the body, ensuring its safety from prying eyes and the intruder hunting the artifact. 

ACT 3: Unraveling the Mystery

As the family digs deeper into Uncle Frank's past, they discover that he was once a highly sought after thief during his youth, known for his remarkable ability to steal rare and valuable items for an underground criminal network. The item in question contains a powerful secret: the power to alter one's destiny by changing a single moment in their past.

Meanwhile, sketchy figures begin lurking throughout their town, believed to be associates of the mysterious caller. As the family frantically searches through Frank's personal belongings, they uncover a trail that eventually leads them to the artifact. However, they also recognize that the power contained within the artifact is too dangerous to be left in any one person's hands.

ACT 4: A Final Showdown

During the funeral service, with Frank's body finally laid to rest, the unknown caller makes a sudden appearance, demanding the family hand over the artifact. In a climactic showdown, the Bensons stand up against the antagonist and his cronies, surprising themselves with acts of courage and quick thinking. Ultimately, they succeed in outsmarting the criminals and reclaiming the artifact.

Recognizing the potential danger held by the artifact, the family unanimously agrees to destroy it by jointly tossing it into a nearby river, symbolizing their commitment to face their destinies together without the manipulation of the past. This entire experience bonds the family even closer, and they find a new appreciation for each other and their shared experiences.

Back at home, as they return to their ordinary lives, the Bensons reminisce about Uncle Frank's exciting life, finding comfort in having shared a small part of his journey, ultimately adding an adventurous and unforgettable chapter to their family's history.
