No, these two questions are inquiring about distinct information. The first question is seeking creative ideas to wish a crush a happy birthday through a video message, while the second question is looking for the best way to respond when someone wishes you a happy birthday. I will answer both questions separately.

1. What is the best idea to wish my crush her birthday through video message?

To create a heartfelt and memorable birthday video message for your crush, consider the following steps:

a) Choose the right setting: Find a comfortable and visually appealing location to record your video message. This could be a cozy room filled with the person's favorite colors or a picturesque outdoor location like a park or beach, depending on their interests.

b) Personalize the message: Start the video with a warm and enthusiastic greeting, addressing your crush by their name. Make it clear that you are thinking specifically about them on their special day.

c) Mention shared memories or inside jokes: If you have any memories or inside jokes shared with your crush, incorporating these details into the birthday message can make it more personal and special. This shows that you pay attention to your interactions and value the experiences you've had together.

d) Compliment them: Make sure to include genuine compliments about their personality or appearance in the message. Keep it light-hearted and avoid being overly intimate or making them uncomfortable.

e) Offer a birthday wish: Express a thoughtful and genuine birthday wish for your crush. This could include wishes for happiness, success, and good health in the year ahead. Keep it sincere and focus on the positive aspects of their life.

f) Keep it concise: Although you want to create a personalized and heartfelt message, avoid making the video too long. Aim for a length between 1-2 minutes, keeping the video's pacing engaging.

g) Add creative elements: If you are skilled in video editing or have access to special effects, consider incorporating animations, transitions, or music that aligns with your crush's interests to make the video even more memorable.

2. What's the best way to reply when someone wishes you a happy birthday?

When someone wishes you a happy birthday, it's important to express gratitude and reciprocate their positivity. Here are a few ideas to respond to a birthday wish:

a) Thank them: Start by thanking the person for taking the time to remember your birthday and sending their wishes. A simple "Thank you for the birthday wishes!" can go a long way in showing appreciation.

b) Acknowledge their thoughtfulness: Let them know how much their message means to you, for example, "Your message brightened my day!"

c) Share a quick update: If you haven't spoken to the person in a while, provide a brief update on how you're enjoying your birthday. This could involve mentioning the activities you've done, the gifts received, or the people you've spent time with.

d) Show your interest in their life: End your response by asking about their well-being or inquiring about a specific aspect of their life, such as work, school, or an ongoing project. This demonstrates that you value the relationship and want to continue the conversation beyond your birthday.

e) Keep it light and friendly: No matter how you choose to respond, remember to maintain a friendly and positive tone that reflects the sentiments of the birthday wish you received.
