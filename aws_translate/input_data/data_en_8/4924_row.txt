Q: Walter wants to serve hushpuppies to his guests for his annual fish fry event. He thinks each guest will eat 5 hushpuppies and he is having 20 guests. He can cook 10 hushpuppies in 8 minutes. How long will it take to cook all of the hushpuppies?
A: He wants to serve 5 hushpuppies to each guest and he is having 20 guests so that's 5 * 20 = 100 hush puppies. He can only cook 10 hushpuppies at a time and he needs to cook 100 hushpuppies so that's 100 / 10 = 10 batches of hushpuppies. Each batch takes 8 minutes to cook and he has 10 batches to cook so it will take him 8 * 10 = 80 minutes. The answer is 80.
Question: Jennifer has ten pears, 20 oranges, and twice as many apples as pears. If she gives her sister two of each fruit, how many fruits does she have left?
Answer: Jennifer has 2 * 10 = 20 apples. She has a total of 10 + 20 + 20 = 50 fruits. She gives her sister 2 pears + 2 oranges + 2 apples = 6 fruits. After giving her sister 2 of each fruit, she has 50 - 6 = 44 fruits left. The answer is 44.
[Question]A man decides to try and do everything off his bucket list while he is still young and fit enough to finish it all. One of his goals was to climb the seven summits. He realizes first he has to get in shape to do it and it takes him 2 years of working out to get healthy enough to take up mountain climbing. He then spends twice that long learning how to be a technically proficient mountain climber. After that he starts with the simplest mountain on the list and climbs them all. He spends 5 months climbing each mountain. After that he takes 13 months learning to dive and dives through all the caves he wants in 2 years. How much time did it take to get through all these goals?
[Answer]He spent 2 * 2 = 4 years learning to climb. He spends 5 * 7 = 35 months climbing all 7 mountains. After a 13 month break, he starts diving so that is 35 + 13 = 48 months. That means it is 48 / 12 = 4 years. So in total it all took 2 + 4 + 4 + 2 = 12 years. The answer is 12.
Q: There is very little car traffic on Happy Street. During the week, most cars pass it on Tuesday - 25. On Monday, 20% less than on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, 2 more cars than on Monday. On Thursday and Friday, it is about 10 cars each day. On the weekend, traffic drops to 5 cars per day. How many cars travel down Happy Street from Monday through Sunday?
A: On Monday there are 20 / 100 * 25 = 5 cars passing the street less than on Tuesday. So on Monday, there are 25 - 5 = 20 cars on Happy Street. On Wednesday, there are 20 + 2 = 22 cars on this street. On Thursday and Friday, there is a total of 10 * 2 = 20 cars passing. On the weekend 5 * 2 = 10 cars are passing. So from Monday through Sunday, there are 20 + 25 + 22 + 20 + 10 = 97 cars traveling down the street. The answer is 97.
Question: Madison makes 30 paper boats and sets them afloat. 20% are eaten by fish and Madison shoots two of the others with flaming arrows. How many boats are left?
Answer: First find the number of boats eaten by fish: 30 boats * 20% = 6 boats. Then subtract the two groups of boats that were destroyed from the original number to find the number left: 30 boats - 6 boats - 2 boats = 22 boats. The answer is 22.
