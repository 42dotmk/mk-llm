These two questions contain different inquiries within the context of Quora and improving a question. I will address each question separately to provide a detailed and long answer.

Question 1: If this question needs improvement then how can it be improved?

Before suggesting improvements, let us first understand why a question on Quora might be marked as "needs improvement." A question might be flagged for improvement if it is:

1. Unclear or insufficiently descriptive
2. Has grammatical or spelling errors
3. It is phrased awkwardly or contains informal language
4. It is overly broad or lacks specificity

Now, to improve the question in question, the following steps can be taken:

1. Clarity and Descriptiveness: Ensure that the question is clear and easily understandable. Provide enough context and details to guide the respondents in the direction of what information you are looking for.

2. Grammar and Spelling: Review the question for any grammatical or spelling errors and correct them. Users are more likely to engage with well-written questions.

3. Proper phrasing and language: Reframe the question using formal and appropriate language. If needed, restructure the question to make it more readable and easier to understand.

4. Specificity: Narrow down the scope of the question and make it more specific, so potential answerers will know precisely what you are asking. If there are several aspects to the question, consider breaking it into multiple separate questions.

Providing an example of an improved version of the first question: “What steps can be taken on Quora to effectively edit and improve a question that has been marked as 'needs improvement'?”

Question 2: Is there a way on Quora to ask why a specific question was marked as needs improvement?

Asking why a specific question was marked as "needs improvement" can help the user get more insight into how to enhance and modify their question. Unfortunately, Quora does not provide a direct or built-in way to ask for the reasoning behind why a particular question received this designation. However, there are still a few options that you can consider to gain some insight:

1. Reach out to experienced users: You can directly message or ask experienced Quora users in a related topic to review your question and provide feedback. They might provide valuable advice or guidance on specific improvements.

2. Observe other questions: By looking at similar questions in the same topic, you can compare and make changes to your question based on the trends and successful questions you see. This process can help you identify what works best on Quora and optimize your question accordingly.

3. Use the "Edit" feature: Even if you're unsure why your question has been marked as needing improvement, you can still try to optimize it by following the guidelines for improving questions (as discussed in response to the first question). Once you've made your edits, you can resubmit the question to see if it receives a more positive response from the community.

In conclusion, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. The first question is asking for recommendations on how to improve a question, while the second question is looking for ways to understand why a particular question was marked as "needs improvement" on Quora. Both questions revolve around the broader theme of enhancing questions on the platform, but they address different aspects of the process.
