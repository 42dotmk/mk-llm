No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. 

Question 1 is asking about the best biking riding gears suitable for all terrain in India, while question 2 is asking if the person can learn to ride gear bikes on a KTM Duke 200. Here are detailed answers to both questions:

Question 1: What are the best biking riding gears for all terrain in India?

To tackle various terrains in India, a rider requires appropriate gear and protection. The best biking riding gears for all terrains in India would include the following:

1. Helmet: A good quality helmet is essential for any rider. Look for a helmet that meets safety standards, fits well, has proper ventilation, and provides a clear visor.

2. Riding Jacket: A riding jacket should be made of high-quality abrasion-resistant material, such as Cordura, leather or mesh, and it should have proper ventilation for hot weather conditions. The jacket should have CE-certified armor for added protection in the shoulders, elbows, and back.

3. Riding Pants: Like a riding jacket, riding pants should also be made of abrasion-resistant material with CE-certified armor in the hip and knee areas. Pants should offer a comfortable fit and have proper ventilation.

4. Riding Gloves: Good-quality gloves are essential for protecting your hands. They should have a snug fit, be made of abrasion-resistant material, and have reinforced palms, knuckle protection, and ideally, touchscreen compatibility.

5. Riding Boots: For all terrains, invest in high-quality riding boots that offer excellent protection for your feet, ankles, and lower legs. They should be made of abrasion-resistant material and should have sturdy soles for better grip on varied surfaces.

6. Knee and Elbow Guards: Additional knee and elbow guards can provide extra protection in case of falls or accidents.

7. Body Armor: A body armor vest can provide extra protection for the chest and back in case of an accident.

8. Neck Brace: A neck brace can help to prevent neck injuries during a crash.

9. Rain Gear: Waterproof jackets, pants, and gloves are essential for riding in the unpredictable Indian monsoon season.

Question 2: Can I learn riding gear bikes on a KTM Duke 200?

Yes, you can learn to ride gear bikes on a KTM Duke 200. However, it is essential to keep the following points in mind:

1. KTM Duke 200 is a performance-oriented motorcycle with a powerful engine, and it may not be the best option for a beginner learning to ride a gear bike. Consider starting with a less powerful, more beginner-friendly bike like a 100-125 cc commuter bike.

2. If you have prior experience riding geared scooters or similar vehicles, you may find it easier to learn on the KTM Duke 200. Make sure you are familiar with the motorcycle's controls and handling before starting.

3. Take a professional training course or find a knowledgeable mentor to help you learn to ride the KTM Duke 200 properly. Proper guidance can make a significant difference in your learning experience.

4. Practice in a safe and controlled environment, such as an empty parking lot or closed roads, before taking the bike onto public roads. It is essential to gain confidence and experience before navigating traffic and difficult road conditions.

In conclusion, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. The first question is about the best biking riding gears for all terrains in India, while the second question is about learning to ride geared bikes on a KTM Duke 200.
