The statement, "Chinese people who arrived in the country after the end of apartheid do not qualify for such benefits," might offer partial clarification, but it does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question, "Why was this classification made?" To better address the question, we need to delve into the historical context and understand the intent behind making such classifications.

Apartheid was a policy of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination that was enforced in South Africa between 1948 and the early 1990s. This system was based on the notion of white superiority and aimed to systematically suppress non-white populations. Consequently, South Africa witnessed an array of laws and practices that promoted racial inequality.

In 1994, apartheid was officially abolished, leading to the establishment of a democratic government in South Africa. The new government, mainly led by the African National Congress, sought to redress the injustices of apartheid by implementing programs aimed at uplifting previously marginalized communities. This included affirmative action policies, land reform, and social and economic programs to level the playing field for those who had suffered racial injustice for decades.

Due to a combination of political, social, and historical factors, South Africa has a complex racial categorization system. People are classified into groups such as African, Coloured, Indian, and White, among others. During apartheid, the Chinese community in South Africa was categorized as "non-white," which meant they were subjected to the same discriminatory laws and practices faced by other non-white communities. However, after apartheid ended, some states in the country considered this community to be "non-Black" and classified them as part of the "Coloured" or "Indian" groups. This new classification generated confusion and controversy among the Chinese community.

In 2008, the Chinese Association of South Africa won a lawsuit, arguing that South African Chinese who had been victims of apartheid should enjoy similar benefits as other marginalized communities. As a result, the High Court ruled that South African Chinese people who had been in the country before and during apartheid could qualify for affirmative action and other benefits designed to redress racial imbalances. This decision was extended only to those Chinese people who had lived in South Africa and experienced apartheid, for they had endured similar plights and discrimination as other non-white population groups.

The classification mentioned in the statement—"Chinese people who arrived in the country after the end of apartheid do not qualify for such benefits"—was likely made to distinguish between those who experienced apartheid and those who arrived in South Africa after the system had been dismantled. The idea was to allocate affirmative action and reparative benefits to the people who endured the injustices of apartheid, rather than the newcomers who did not face those challenges.

To summarize, the classification was made to differentiate between Chinese immigrants who faced apartheid and those who arrived after the system had ended. It aimed to ensure that the affirmative action and other benefits designed to redress racial imbalances only applied to the communities who had suffered under the apartheid regime, and not to the post-apartheid Chinese immigrants who did not experience those challenges.
