[Question]While reading about the history of different towns, Jared learned that Euston had 20 more carriages than Norfolk. Norwich had 100 carriages, and Flying Scotsman had 20 more carriages than Norwich. If Euston had 130 carriages, how many carriages are there in all?
[Answer]If Flying Scotsman had 20 more carriages than Norwich, and Norwich had 100 carriages, then Flying Scotsman had 100 + 20 = 120 carriages. Together, Flying Scotsman and Norwich had 120 + 100 = 220 carriages. If Euston had 130 carriages, 20 more carriages than Norfolk, Norfolk had 130 - 20 = 110 carriages. Together, Euston and Norfolk had 110 + 130 = 240 carriages. Altogether, Euston, Norfolk, Norwich, and Flying Scotsman had 240 + 220 = 460 carriages. The answer is 460.
Q: Ibrahim wants to buy an MP3 player for 120 euros and a CD for 19 euros. He has 55 euros in savings. His father participates in his purchase by giving him 20 euros. How much money does Ibrahim lack?
A: The total price of the purchases is 120 + 19 = 139 euros. The amount of money he has after his father's help is 55 + 20 = 75 euros. The purchase amount is 139 euros, so he is missing 139 â€“ 75 = 64 euros. The answer is 64.
Question: Elsie has a specific amount of wet wipes in a container in the morning. Throughout the day, she refills the container with 10 more wipes after using up 20. By nighttime, she only has 60 wipes left. How many wipes were in the container in the morning?
Answer: Let w be the number of wet wipes Elsie had in the morning. Throughout the day, she used w - 20 wet wipes. Once that happened, she had to refill the container resulting in w - 20 + 10 = w - 10 wet wipes. By nighttime, she had w - 10 = 60 wipes. So then, w = 60 + 10 = 70. She started with w = 70 wipes. The answer is 70.
[Question]James is trying to create a new breed of kittens with extra-long tails. Each generation of kittens he breeds has a tail 25% longer than the last generation. If the first generation has tails 16 cm long, how long are the third generation's tails?
[Answer]First find how much longer the second generation's tails are: 25% * 16 cm = 4 cm. Then add that length to the first generation's tail length to find the second generation's tail length: 4 cm + 16 cm = 20 cm. Then find how much longer the third generation's tails are: 25% * 20 cm = 5 cm. Then add that length to the second generation's tail length to find the third generation's tail length: 5 cm + 20 cm = 25 cm. The answer is 25.
Q: Helga works for a newspaper company. She can write 5 articles every 30 minutes, and she usually works 4 hours a day 5 days a week. If Helga worked an extra 2 hours last Thursday, and an extra 3 hours last Friday, how many articles was she able to write this week?
A: Helga writes 5 x 2 = 10 articles per hour. And she can write 10 x 4 = 40 articles every 4 hours. So, the total number of articles she usually writes for a week is 40 x 5 = 200 articles. She was able to write 10 x 2 = 20 articles on her extra 2 hours last Thursday. And she was able to write 10 x 3 = 30 articles on her extra hour last Friday. So, the total number of articles she was able to write on her extra hours is 20 + 30 = 50. Therefore, she was able to write a total of 200 + 50 = 250 this week. The answer is 250.
