Losing 10 kgs in 3 months with diet and exercise is a realistic and achievable goal. Following a structured plan and being consistent with your efforts can help you achieve this weight loss. Here's a detailed plan that can help you lose 10 kgs in 3 months:

1. Set a realistic goal: Losing 10 kgs in 3 months means aiming to lose approximately 0.8 kgs per week. This is a safe and achievable goal, ensuring that you maintain your health while losing weight.

2. Determine your daily calorie needs: Calculate your TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) to determine your daily caloric needs for maintenance. You can do this by using an online calculator or consulting a dietitian. Once you know your TDEE, create a calorie deficit of 500-700 calories per day to lose 0.8 kgs per week.

3. Follow a balanced and portion-controlled diet: Include a mix of vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats in your diet. Controlling portion sizes is essential to avoid overeating and keeping within your calorie range.

Here's an example of what your daily meals may look like:

- Breakfast: A bowl of whole-grain cereal or oatmeal with low-fat milk and a serving of fruit.
- Mid-morning snack: A piece of fruit or a handful of nuts.
- Lunch: A salad with lean protein (chicken, tofu, or legumes), lots of vegetables, and a small portion of whole grains (rice, quinoa, or whole-wheat bread).
- Afternoon snack: Low-fat yogurt with berries or carrot and cucumber sticks with hummus.
- Dinner: Grilled fish or chicken with steamed vegetables and a small portion of whole grains.
- Evening snack: A cup of herbal tea or a small serving of air-popped popcorn.

4. Drink plenty of water: Stay hydrated throughout the day, aiming for a minimum of 2 liters of water. Drinking water can help control appetite, improve digestion, and support overall health.

5. Get moving: Incorporate both cardiovascular exercises and strength training into your fitness routine. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, and include 2 or more days of strength training for all major muscle groups.

Here's an example of a weekly exercise routine:

- Monday: 30-45 minutes of brisk walking or jogging
- Tuesday: Strength training (upper body)
- Wednesday: 30-45 minutes of cycling or swimming
- Thursday: Strength training (lower body)
- Friday: 30-45 minutes of aerobic exercise (e.g., dance class, HIIT)
- Saturday: Strength training (core and full-body exercises)
- Sunday: Rest and recovery

6. Get enough sleep and manage stress: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night and use stress management techniques like meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga to help with weight loss efforts.

7. Track your progress and stay accountable: Keep a food and exercise journal, and weigh yourself weekly to measure progress. Adjust your diet and exercise plan as needed based on your progress.
