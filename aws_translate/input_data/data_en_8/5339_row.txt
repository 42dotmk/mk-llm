The professor gave Nick but not Logan an A because Logan showed poor knowledge of the periodic table of elements. This became evident during the course of the semester while they were both enrolled in the advanced chemistry class. The professor had high expectations from all the students, and aimed to ensure that everyone gained a deep understanding of the subject.

At the beginning of the semester, both Nick and Logan showed enthusiasm and keen interest in learning about the periodic table of elements. They participated in class discussions, submitted assignments on time, and asked relevant questions. However, as the semester progressed, a clear distinction emerged in the performance of the two students.

On one hand, Nick consistently demonstrated a strong grasp of the periodic table and its underlying concepts. He could accurately identify the atomic number, mass, and electron configurations of various elements. In addition, Nick could also describe the various trends observed across periods and groups, such as atomic radius and ionization energy, and make insightful connections that underpinned the intrinsic properties of the elements.

Nick's exceptional proficiency in this area was not just limited to rote memorization, but a profound understanding of how the periodic table was organized and how the elements interacted with one another. This was particularly evident in his impressive performance in the laboratory, where he accurately predicted the outcomes of various chemical reactions based on his knowledge of the periodic table.

In stark contrast, Logan struggled to demonstrate adequate knowledge of the periodic table of elements. Despite his initial interest and dedication, he consistently failed to recall basic information about the elements, such as their symbols and placement on the periodic table. Additionally, he struggled to understand and apply the general trends and patterns observed across groups and periods.

Moreover, his lack of understanding made it difficult for him to make connections among the elements, which affected his ability to predict the outcomes of chemical reactions and problem-solving tasks. During lab exercises, Logan often relied on his classmates and written resources to guide him, as his limited knowledge of the periodic table hampered his capability to conduct experiments independently and effectively.

As the semester concluded, the professor had no choice but to take into account the evident discrepancies in the performance of the two students. While Nick displayed a comprehensive understanding and impressive mastery of the periodic table of elements, Logan's persistent struggle to grasp its fundamental concepts and principles led to his subpar performance. Consequently, the professor felt it was only fair to award Nick an A for his achievements, while Logan was not given the same grade due to his inadequate grasp of the periodic table of elements.

In conclusion, despite their initial enthusiasm and commitment, the different levels of understanding and application of the periodic table of elements led to divergent outcomes for Nick and Logan. While Nick's extensive knowledge and practical application of the concepts earned him an A, Logan's poor knowledge of the periodic table left him trailing behind, ultimately resulting in a lower grade. The professor's decision underscored the importance of a profound knowledge of the periodic table of elements, which is the foundation of chemistry.
